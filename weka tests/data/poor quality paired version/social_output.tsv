and th of one grand fable a hain of novels like mr anthony trollopes ars e t is osen tially a birth of our own time it belongs to the rmtion from bygone excess after l eape from the rule of formal critics in french perig  in the outburst which in literature corresponded to the political reactio that bad its centre in the great french revolution wite claimed freedom of syle abandoned  old traditios claimed the right to reonide canons of i authority and search for the prejudice that was to be cast r out from old traditions of the collective rights of citizens and individ rights of men much selfexamination led to an exaggerated sentiment the cherishing of national as wellas personal individuality sent men beck  to their old national literates made them imitative of its antique forms the days of excitement pause the r nationality r ined and out of it came in this country a t general reverting of its literature into homely saxon forms of speech but the next reaction was from overstrain of sentiment towards a reticnce of feeling much of it manly some of it hypocritical it was good to fall back on quiet unimpassioned truth it has more dignity and force too than the cleverest ex tion but the rmtion against fals sentiment mae many unduly shy in the expresso of true feeling and has even provoked an affectation of satiricalindiferenoethat sits ungracefullyenoughon many a writer whom nature never made to take nil admirari for the motto on his shield of this motion mr thackerys writing was at all points a complete expression even to the air of

belongs the realiam in our fition that eschews bayards and front de r bwsfs and seeks to reproduce the interest thatlies in a ler visiou of the daily life about us the result is dreary r enough when there is no insight of genius in the weaver of the tale or sympathy or alm and clear perception of realities under the oial forms but when any or all thea conditions of success in weaving pictures o the life fof our own time have been fulfilled in any novelist he holds up his mirror to the nature that lies really before him and fulfils the highest functions of his craft as mr trola lope hs done in  orley farm and in the  claverings and r in the five novels the warden barchester towers iframley parsonage the small house at ton 1 and this l st chronicle of barset which as one broad and harmoniouspicture of english manner in five part whereof each is a d ble and thoroughly successful story com1 pletein itself has not we believe an equal in justice to l mr trollope and to itself the public should have these e barsetehire noves extant not only as detached works but  duly bound lettered and bought as a connected series their author half apologises for having ingered so long i about one group of homes but in doing so a we have i aid he simply followed to its natural end a form of fiction i that is the true birth of our own day and of which he is an aepted master nobody is more literal than mr anthony trollope k in his reproduction of manners and converstion of t the day for which he writes if he gave in his firm clear unexaggerated way only the outside of mns talking and doing his books would be very dull  indeed wel written but altogether commonplace they va interest us all because simple as they look there is a true smpathy underlig his p ptions of the characters of men and women the dli charm of many of his portraits of women would be evidence enough of this but is a there any sentiment in 8terne so true as that which hau 6 dealt tenderly with septimus harding

 co xheke is one advantage in writing a story as a serialthe individual portions have an elaboration and finish which a novel written in the piece does not always obtain at the hands of the author these  last chronicles are very carefully written and the characters have remarkable substance and vitality it is not given to every one to create characters out of the workaaay worldneither better nor worse than persons whom we all meet every dayand yet to be able so to lay bare their hearts and etories that the reader accepts them as friends and acquaintances follows their fortunes through the volume specially devoted to them remembers the subordinate persons and is glad to hear their story at length as soon as mr trollope is pleased like another scheherazade to take up one of the threads of the old story and weave a new one from it the series of barsetshire chronicles have all been singularly real in their interest and veraciously like nature in the living characters introduced each chronicle has a central history with slighter sketches grouped round it the story of the subordinate personages has each in their turn been worked out at length the interest has been kept up the electric current has gone without break through the circle from the days of thc dear old warden of hirams hospital at barchester to these last chronicles of barset wherein mr harding full of years and goodness drops into an honoured grave in the meanwhile all the personages of the town and country have in their turn appeared before the reader and if the reader does not believe in barsetshire and all who live thereinlady lufton the rev mr robarts the great duke of omnium and the still greater marchioness of hartletop the dean of barchester the archdeacon grantley the poor bishop and his wife the terrible mrs proudiev along with others as numerous as a list of runners entered for the derbythe fault is not in mr trollope but in himself how many both men and women have desired to know the sequel to the story of lily dale and what numerous sympathisers and wellwishers has not johnny eames had in his crossed love and constancy but one has always felt that poor johnny would never grow up into a marriageable hero one only hoped he might not fall a victim to one of the designing young females with whom he had a curious tendency to perilous flirtation everybody who ever read  the small house at allington has bestowed many a passing thought on what would be the end of crosbie whether he would ever have the chance of marrying lily dale and whether she could would or ought to accept him it tells of great gifts that mr trollope should thus endow his characters with flesh and bloodandindividuality of interest make their surroundings graphic and tangible and yet make the men and women stand out from their background and live and move like human beings but it is evidence of still higher powers when the fortunes of these inhabitants of mr trollopes county of barsetshire obtain such a thorough hold on the interest of readers that they are anxious to hear more about them more even than mr trollope is willing to tell for he declares on his titlepage and in his closing paragraphs that the present is the last word he will ever say about barsetshire and its inhabitants we only hope he will not keep his word for he leaves  distant wilds still opening to the view and we hope he will tell us a great deal more about many persons mentioned in the present chronicle the hero of the present history is poor mr crawley the perpetual curate of hagglestock with whom acquaintance was first made in framley parsonage the sketch there introduced of the proud spartanlike poverty of the man with his learning his uprightness his devotion to his calling was very striking the strong counsel and rugged help he gave to his softer and weaker brother in the time of his trouble and temptation made for him a permanent niche in the memory and reverence of the reader but we hoped that we had left him comfortable and that after his wife had tided over that dangerous illness things would never be so bad with them again we hoped there would be promotion or at any rate a better income for them from some quarter but here in this  last chronicle we find them worse off than ever in a mess of debt and in a slough of discomfort which seems utterly hopeless and fathomless how things have grown to be so bad wc are not distinctly told nor the occasion when mr crawley consented to ask help and money not as a loan but as a gift from dean arabin but so it has fallen out the dean has given him money almost to the amount of onehalf of his poor yearly stipend and mr crawley has accepted it with much pain and confusion of soul keeping the money by him for weeks unused in the hope of being able by some miracle to do without it altogether but at last driven to extremity he has sent a cheque for 20 to the bank with his own name written at the back received and paid away the money and behold the cheque is proved to have been stolen  when asked how it came into his hands the poor man is bewildered he makes a statement which is at once disproved and he afterwards hazards the guess that it was a portion of the money given to him by the dean the dean now on his eastern travels is written to and denies all knowledge of the cheque matters look very black the man who lost the cheque institutes a prosecution no one except the prosecutor really believes mr crawley to be guilty but the difficulty of thinking him innocent admits of no explanation he has made two opposite statements neither of them true and this man who has so little money that he can barely buy bread to eat is unable to explain how he came by a cheque for 20 the interest of the story grows patheticalmost tragic the character of mr crawley is very clever the pride the misery the soreheartedness the excellence and utter perverseness of the man do not diminish the interest aud reverence of the reader for him he is felt to be a higher class of man than any of the pleasanter and more prosperous clergy around him though they do themselves honour by their staunch friendship in his sore need their shades of character are skilfully kept up and the whole conduct of the story is able and successful in drawing and sustaining the character of mr crawley mr trollope has given evidence of more subtle power than is to be found in any of his other people of course the mystery is solved at last in the simplest and most natural manner mr crawley is not only cleared but he is left at the end of the book in a new coat and a comfortable living we hope we have not heard the last of him for we should like to hear what will be the influence of prosperity upon him there are incidental sketches that are charming mr crawleys passage of arms with the bishops wife is delightful but justice is done even to mrs proudie and the reader parts from her without malice though to be sure she does the only thing possible to redeem sympathy the story of lily dale comes to a conclusion in one sense and on the whole it is satisfactory the meeting with crosbie is very well managed but in spite of all that mr trollope says we persist in hoping that she will find a good man whom she can make into hero enough to marry him a womans heart ought to be too deep to be drained of its love by one false lover whom she dressed and decorated entirely out of her own stores there is much delicate painting in this second appearance of lily dale and she loses none of the readers interest many other old acquaintances are disposed of poetical justice is executed on the unhappy crosbie he is reduced to his real proportions and the reader feels rather sorry for him than not we have spoken heartily of all we liked in these last chronicles but there are some four or five chanters which seem to have been introduced neck and shoulders apropos of nothing at all johnny eames is taken out to dinner by an artist conway dalrymple and all that ensues is simply a disagree able interruption to the course of the stoiyj on which it acts as a patch unskilfully laid on of incongruous colour and different material johnny eames loses somewhat in the readers regard but miss clara van siever madalina demolines with the two old harridans their mothers musselborough bangles dobbs broughton and mrs dobbs broughton even conway himself and all the story of the mock loves of madalina and mrs dobbs broughton are altogether out of place no one ever wishes to hear of them further their introduction is a mistake,social

B8140,['4363494'],  reviews of books rachel ray mr trollope is one of the few novelists who make us forget the labour of criticism in our enjoymient of their books he throws off his novels with the ease of a man writing to some friend the latest gossip of his circle and seems as much amused with the foibles and humours of his characters as if he were laugghing at persons he had seen and heard and not at the creatures of his imagination this characteristic of his writing he has nowhere displayed more strikingly than in the novel before us it is almost a laugh from beginning to end marked here and there with touches of pathos effectively thrown in and though at times verging on caricature only violating the truth of nature to the extent of a slight exaggeration without plot and almost without incident we are carried through the book by the writers exuberant spirits and his way of turning to us the quizzical side of his characters but still more by the power with which he realises the manners the habits and speech of english life in their homeliest garb they are real beings who play their part in his story we have met them have spoken and lived with them we have sat with them in their houses have walked with them over the fields watched with them the setting sun by the churchyard stile and shared their loves and jealousies their weaknesses and their virtues we have seen before this cottage interior with its halfdozen books with gilt leaves arranged in shapes on the small round table where also is deposited the spangled mat of wondrous brightness made of short white sticks of glhss strung together with its shells and china figures on the chimneypiece the birdcage without a bird the old sofa the old armchair and carpet and the old round mirror over the fireplace we have some experience of mrs tappitts nianceuvres to convert a teaparty into a ball and win her lord and master by beautifully fine degrees to consent to one expense after another till the accumulation involves as an absolute necessity a still further outlay for which he is to be consoled by one of her best beefsteak puddings and who that has not been buried all his life in unredeemed bricks and mortar has not met mrs sturt the farmers wife who likes a young man who does the thing thats honest and is willing to lend her friendly aid to bring two young people together again who have been separated by the stupid interference of soured or silly meddlers  with such traits does  rachel ray abound and if it is not to be ranked though we doubt this with mr trollopes best works he has written nothing which will give his readers more thorough delight the design of his tale is to show how excessively mischievous overgood people may make themselves and that there is a practical malignity even about religion itself when it is pushed to an unnatural extreme with this view mr trollope begins by placing before us a lady very good and very weak whom he describes as one of those women who cannot grow alone as standard trees but for whom the support and warmth of some wall some paling some post is absolutely necessary who in their growth will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach while he lived mrs ray leaned upon her husband but on his death leaving her with two daughters the eldest of whom dorothea took after her father and was stem sober and steady the widow  immediately married herself to this girl who became thenceforth the prop against which she could grow but in time dorothea shared and became widow prime at the end of a year returning at the end of that time to her mothers cottage  black and stiff and stern to be her mothers prop once more mr trollope describes this womans character with great gusto prim and tidy by nature  it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance therefore she was rough with weeds her caps were  lumpy heavy full of woe and clean only as decency might requirenot nicely clean with feminine care her dress too was rough and black and clingingdisagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any wcmin which is worn day after day through all hours though naturally welllooking her desire had been to e ugly forbidding attractive almost repulsive so thats in ver truth she might be known to be a widow indeed she was t8ilf no bp ebut  she had taigt muel to believe that sheerfulnas w a sin an tdat the more she beam morose the rsjegd rw a xnv1 in two vdolum by a7 atby twmbpc aq nearer would she be to the fruition of those hopes of future happiness on which her heart was set against this lady as against a wall whose support was  strong but not at all times pleasant leaned mrs ray to her own satisfaction but not quite to that of her younger daughter rachel who was neither weak nor stern but willing to take such pleasure as life offered her disliked mrs primes dorcas meetings and displayed  a little wickedness now and then to the extent perhaps of a vain walk into baslehurst on a summer evening a little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and whom she had seen a yawn in church or a word of complaint as to the length of the second sunday sermon the reader soon finds that in one of her walks rachel has seen  a young man this fact explodes like a bombshell in the cottap at braggs end and mrs ray holding the lupine theory with regard to youths of the opposite sex we see that what with her timidity on this score and mrs primes uncompromising enmity to happi ness of any kind rachers relations with the  young man from the brewery will be as little pleasant as it is possible for the two widows to make them but luke rowan the wolf in question is a youth of strong decision of character he has made up his mind to love rachel and that rachel shall love him which the girl is willing enough to do the day after mrs tappitts ball luke finds his way to braggs end and startles mrs rays confidence in her theory by the frankness with which he confesses his love and asks permission to visit rachel but above all by the way in which he takes his tea quite like a steady young man indeed she says defending herself against mrs primes remonstrances  he drank three large cups and if as rachel says he alajoes  to church regularly i dont know why we are to judge him anw say that hes anything out of the way the bickerings between mrs ray and her eldest daughter on this subject are described with the nicest discrimination of character and with an undercurrent of great humouir what is a higher testimony to mr trollopes power is the skill with which he develops rachels character in t conflict between the widows and the touches of purely natural and beautiful emotion by which he wins us to love her the dialogue between rachel and mrs ray after mrs prime has left them in which the girl tries to draw from her mother what luke has sai about her while she ran over to the farmers to fetch cream for the tea is one of the most charming of the many exquisite passages m these volumes mrs ray  so inconsequent in her mental workings so shandypated that it did not occur to her that an entirely new view of luke rowans purposes had been exposed to rach during this visit of mrs primes and not realising the fact that she had authorised rachel to regard luke as her lover while rachel remembers every word and begins to think that with hex mothers leave an intimacy with luke would be very pleasant but what was it that he did say mamma 9that is if you dow think it wrong to tell me i hardly know but i dont snppose it can be wrong for no young man could have spoken nicer and it made me happy to hear himso it did for the moment oh mamma do tell me and rachel kneeled down before her  wellhe said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen did he mamma and the girl clng closer to her mother a she heard the pleasant words but i oughtnt to tell you such nonsense as that and then 1h said that he wanted to come out here and see you andandand it is simply this that he meant to ask you to be his sweeheart if i would let him   and what did you say mamma  i couldnt eay anything because you came back bat you told dolly  mrs prime that you would be glad to ae him whenever he might choose to come here did i yes you said he was welcome to come whenever he plemb and that you believed him to be a very good young man and so i do why should he be anything else  i dont say that hes anything else but mamma well my dear what shall i say to him if he does ask me that question  h has called me by my name two or three times and spoken to me m though he wanted me to like him if he does say anything to like that what shall i answer    if you think you dont like him well enough you must toll him so of course c yes of course i must then rachel was silent for a mia or two she had not as yet received the full answer which o desired in such an alternative as that which her mother had southwest gested we may say that she would have known how to frame b answer to the young man without any advice from her mother bo there was another alternative as to which she thought it

of a married woman with regard to money the tappitt family again call out mr trollopes powers of female portraiture which in the different shading of the three sisters is employed with happy effect slight sketches though they are the interview between mrs tappitt mrs rowan and mrs ray when the two former ladies visit the widow to represent to her the impropriety of a marriage between luke and rachel is again a proof of the ability with which the author holds his characters in hand and brings out their several idiosyncracies but perhaps the best thing in the novel is the pertinacity with which luke rowan deterniines either to drive old tappitt out of the brewery or compel him to brew good beer though it was a sour and muddy stream that flowed from his vats a beverage disagreeable to the palate and very cold and uncomfortable to the stonach tappitt made fifteen hundred a year out of it and to be told by a youngster that he did not know how to brew good beer was an indignity he could not put up with but the choleric old brewer is no match for luke cool and resolute at all hazards to brew good beer for baslehurst even if he is obliged to build a new brewery he threatens to do

domestic interior in mr trollopes best style if we are to find fault with this delightful story we might object that the artifice by which the stream of rachels love is disturbed is improbable that her mother would have been advised to make her write the letter which for a time clouds her joy and makes it doubtful whether the lover who broke in on her almost solitary and very humble life with such a sunburst of undreamt of happinessadvised too by the clergyman who had given such a sensible judgement on the question whether it would be sinful if she went to mrstappitts ballis notwethink likely that lovingluke as she did she would write it is less probable for rachel has a will of her own but that lukehonest straightforward manly lover as he isshould be put off by it should not feel the love that throbs under its air of prudence and attribute the love to rachel and the prudence to her stupid counsellors is less likely still but as this letter gives us two volumes when but for it we could only have had one we shall not quarrel with it and after all nothing is so flexible as human nature and to say that it will do this or will not do that under given circumstances is to forget how often it acts in contradiction to itself and again how often acts that seem to be contradiction on the surface are logical enough if we could minutely weigh the feelings from which they spring,social

B8734,['3235476'],  what are we to do with our wells scientist and supersalesman by collin brooks what are we to do with our lives  by h g wells 3s 6d hlincniann at certain fairs and  feasts  there is still to be met the traditional type of medicineman and philanthropist with a drug or a plan of life to sell of whom it is hard to decide whether he be a genuine friend of man reduced by the force of faulty economic circumstances to the employment of the means of the pedlar or a pedlar who has had the trading wit to take for his commodity something at once more desirable and less bulky than the rolls of linoleum or packets of cheap sweets offered by his fellows he sells not an article but a hope not a gadget but an aspiration and the technique of his selling is the technique of the preacher and the prophet he stands there not to make a livelihood but to do good to his hearers and all who traffic with him will bless his name and the token that lie sells as like as not is rosecoloured water or a regimen which all sensible men are already following the singular thing about him is that with all his desire not to make money but merely to do good his turnover exceeds that of an of the franker merchants who throng with him the open mart so it is in letters and thought wvith mlr h g wells there can be no question that mr wells is sincere that he feels inspired by one increasing purpose and that he has something to offer which the world would do well to buy but his ingenuous devotion to the cause of spreading his gospel has all the effects of an ingenious sales campaign recently when lie proffered a new diagnosis of the ills of the world of william clissold heor his publisherattained triple profit and recurring advertisement by submitting the diagnosis chart in three separate volumes that one must admit was smart wvork but the newer techlniquweis even better in what are wve to do with our lives nmr wvells has presented a new version of  the open conspiracy when the earlier work may be said to have outlived its sales life here insistent ix an portrait by ruazll mr h g wells edition revised and rewritten so far so good the same public may be expected to throng again to the counter but the revised and rewritten version is very largely an agent in advance for a new and larger work by the author to be called  the work wealth and happiness of mankind and it is not wholly to be appreciated or perhaps even fully comprehended unless the reader has already procured his copies of  the outline of history  and  the science of life and will at the first moment procure his copy of the new work mr wells realising how inadequate was the formal schooling which procured him his diplomas and certificates from london university and the college of preceptors was moved really to educate himself and while so doing to reeducate his ignorant fellows  now i find by getting these three correlated compilations into existence i have at last in however rough a fashion brought together a complete system of ideas upon which the open conspirator can go before anyone could hope to get on to anything like a practical working directive answer to what are we to do with our lives  it was necessary to know what our lives werethe science of life what has led up to their present pattern the outline of history  and this third book the work wealth and happiness of mankind to tell what we were actually doing and supposed to be doing with our working lives day by day at the present time     after this early and frank avowal it is evident that what we are now reading is really the extended preface to the forthcoming book bound in cloth and costing the quite moderate sum of three shillings and sixpence it is in short a sample of the panacea and if anyone complains that the previous sample labelled  the open conspiracv was ample for his purpose the vendor is ready to urge that this is a much better sample compounded after watching the effects of the earlier sample upon representative takers  xwell what are we to do with our lives  we are to rid ourselves of waste muddle and confusion we are to wage var against tradition we are to abandon nationalism and petty loyalties for the sake of the great unity of humanity the family unit is to be retained but it is to be  enlarged in many respects and more responsive to collective social influence and in that enlarged family social life must be relearnt generation after generation should there be any man so foolish as to suggest that it scarce needs a wells to tell us what to do with our lives since religion already undertakes the task of exposition mr weus is ready for him true he admits we have to bring religion as a fundamental matter into this discussion but in the vast stir and occasions of modern life so much of what we call religion remains irrelevant or dumbit does not seem to  join on  to the main parts of the general problem of living it has lost touch but if religion is no certain mentor much can be done with the religious spirit the open conspiracy shall have its saints  can religion or can it not synthesise the needed effort to lift mankind out of our present disorders dangers baseness frustrations and futilities to a phase of relative security accumulating knowledge systematic and continuing growth in power and the widespread deep happiness of hopeful and increasing life  our answer here is that the religious spirit in the light of modern knowledge can do this thing the religious spirit in the light of modern knowledge is therefore to inspire the open conspiracya new and happier world a world community is awakening within the body of the old order and for that awakening mr wells has found that name openly to conspire to found utopia is a delightful occupation but two doubts obsess the recruit is the same utopia present in the minds of all those who ally themselves to the movement and does the instigator of the conspiracy ask anv less from the world than the great organised religions have asked and failed to receive is the open conspiracy of wells more likely to succeed than the open conspiracy of rome than the open conspiracy of comte  mr vells himself is under no illusion as to the ties which bind mankind to the old ideas and idolh  but all these obsolete values and attitudes with which our minds are cumbered must be cleared out if the new faith is to have free play we have to clear them out not only from our own minds but from the minds of others who are to become our associates the finer and more picturesque these obsolescent loyalties obsolescent standards of honour obsolescent religious associations may seem to us the more thoroughly must we seek to release our minds and the minds of those about us from them and cut off all thoughts of a return  we cannot compromise with these vestiges of the ancient order and be faithful servants of the new whatever we retain of them will come back to life and grow again it is no good to operate for cancer unless the whole growth is removed leave a crown about and presently you will find it being worn by someone resolved to be a king keep the name and image of a god without a distinct museum label and sooner or later you will discover a worshipper on his knees to it and be lucky not to find a human sacrifice upon the altar wave a flag and it will wrap about you of yourself even more than of the community is this true there can be no halfmeasures you have not yet completed your escape to the open conspiracy from the cities of the plain while it is still possible for you to take a single backward glance this strong passage of exhortation is an excellent example of mr wellss cunning technique as a hotgospeller he will mention kings but only to imply tyranny he will mention religion but only to infer human sacrifice he will mention flags but only to deduce some inevitable hampering of actionand the open conspiracy itself is presented not as an alternative to some other means of finding a utopia but as the inevitable and only alternative to sodom and gommorah even the word  obsolete  is skilfully used these obsolete values obsolete loyalties obsolete standards of honour obsolete religious associationswhy are they obsolete  can it be that they have earned the damning adjective not because they have actually hampered mankind in its march to more spacious living but because their disciplines and demands proved too irksome for the mind and temperament of art kipps  the first requisite of the open conspiracy is to free the mind from prejudice it can at least be said of ar wedls as the instigator of the conspiracy that by the evidence of this book he should be a good judge of prejudice,social

B6449,['8961549'],  hero tales and leaends of the serbian by woislav m petrovitch harrap  co 10 6d net during the late balkan wars servia surprised her friends and foes alike by her military exploits today she is surprising them still further and the gallant fight she is making against austriahungary has won for her many new friends and admirers in this country the publication of mr petrovitchs book comes therefore at an opportune moment it is pleasant to be able to add that it is well worth attention for its own sake the first part is given up to tales of the national heroes who flourished before the coming of the turk or at least before he had planted his foot firmly on the country  kralyevitch marko or prince marko of prilip tsar doushan tsar lazar banovitch strahinya and others these tales have been selected from the third edition of vouk stephanovitch karadgitchs great collection of the national ballads and translated by the author and though he more than once laments his inability to set them before us in metrical form they are even in their present dress decidedly attractive indeed comparing mr petrovitchs translations with the metrical versions of sir john bowlingof which three specimens are includedwe must confess to a preference for the former a score of representative folktales follow the tales of the heroes and finally we have some servian popular anecdotes which show here and there a pretty wit the folktales are for the greater part strongly reminiscent of those of a similar class in other countries but they are by no means lacking in interest moreover we find in them striking traces of contact with the turk and through him with the arab yet it must not be thought that they have no originality or character of their own there is about them a sturdy morality which characterises the hero tales also that is certainly not oriental and here and there they strike a note of tragedy that is rare in our own tales of a similar class amongst the heroes kralyevitch marko naturally takes first place he is something more than the national hero servians regard him as the personification of the national character if we adopt that view we must certainly esteem the national character for marko with all his faults was a gallant knight indeed it is interesting to learn that helike several other national heroes and saints is not dead but sleeping with his great sword plunged to the hilt in the rock beside him ready to serve his country when necessary4fc to reestablish the mediaeval empire lost at the battle of kossovo a footnote tells us how he actually did appear during the late war and led the servian troops to victory against the turks the information necessary to a proper enjoyment of the tales is given in the introduction and the first three chapters these contain a brief history of the servians since they emigrated from galicia and many particulars of national customs and superstitions  and readers may well find this the most interesting part of the book especially at the present time here is the authors estimate of his countrymen  44 the average serbian has a rather lively temperament he is highly sensitive and very emotional his enthusiasm is quickly roused but mast emotions with him are as a rule of short duration however he is extremely active and sometimes persistent truly patriotic he is always ready to sacrifice his life and property for national interests which he understands particularly well thanks to his intimate knowledge of the ancient history of his people transmitted to him from generation to generation through the pleasing medium of popular epic poetry composed in von simple decasyllabic verseentirely serbian in its origin ho is extremely courageous and always ready for war although patriarchal and conservative in everything national he is ready and willing to accept new ideas very submissive in his zadrooga and obedient to his superiors he is often despotic when elevated to power the history of all the southern slavs pictures a series of violations depositions political upheavals achieved sometimes by the most cruel means and acts of treachery  all mainly due to the innate and hitherto inexpugnable faults characteristic of the race such as jealousy and an inordinate desire for power such frankness wins our respect when mr petrovitch tells us boldly that 44 the worship of naturehas not even to our day vanished from the popular creed of the balkans we feel safe in trusting ourselves to his guidance the balkans are generally so extremely anxious to prove themselves quite abreast of if not a little ahead of the times that they are apt to become tiresome there is no reason why they should seek to ape the west in all things or why they should be ashamed to confess that all their old beliefs and 44 superstitions  are not dead yet the belief in vampires seems to have originated in this part of europe unfortunately mr petrovitch tells us little about them we should like to know more how for instance does  the black horse without blemish help to discover the grave in which the vampire is  as to our old friend the dragon the servians know that the form in which he was always depicted for us and is actually depicted by one of mr petrovitchs illustrators is 44 merely used as a misleading mask   44 in his true character a dragon is a handsome youth possessing superhuman strength and courage and ho is usually represented as in love with some beautiful princess or empress evidently he is a refined monster it may be noted indeed that these servian stories tales of the peasants though they be commonly showa refinement and delicacy of feeling that are surprising in this respect they resemble the turkish tales but not of course the arab another pleasing feature is the real love of animals which they reveal marko himself shares his glory as he regularly shared his red wine with 44 sharatz his marvellous piebald charger banovitch strahinya owes his life to his faithful greyhound caraman  and instances of birds and beasts befriending human beings are numerous the reese the servian nymphs are not nearly so attractive as our own queen mab and her followers 44 they believed in god and st john and abhorred the turk but 4 they could be very cruel   they had an unpleasant way of foretelling the death of heroes and others  and they were given to destroying buildingsor rather to preventing their completion unless the builders offered up a human sacrifice it would be interesting by the way to learn where the superstition about offering up a human sacrifice to ensure the stability of a building had its origin and at what period of the worlds history it was clearly widespread for tales founded upon it are current in many parts of the near and middle east the authors descriptions of servian customs and ceremonies observed on various festivals and feast days are noteworthy and his comments are apt many of the customs are as picturesque as they are quaint and it is to be hoped that they will not entirely disappear mr petrovitch is perhaps inclined to be unfair to the turk at times as for instance when he talks of the monks  inviolable within the sacred walls of their monasteries being the only scribes and authors left under the 4 blighting domination of the turk   and forgets that the very existence of the monks and their  sacred walls  argues tolerance on the part of the turk the illustrations are for the most part good and the book is well printed though mistakes in spelling are rather numerous

translations his work wvill be the more valuable of the two to linguistic students but on our side of the channel mr websters is lihely to be far the more widely read there is very little in these basque stories which is specially characteristic except the names of the supernatural beings who figure in them it is quite impossible for even the most imaginative reader to construct out of them the faintest picture of basque life as distinguished from that led by ordinary spanish or french or even german or italian peasants nor can they serve to convey any idea of the peculiarities of basque thought or feeling their moral and physical views are utterly destitute of local colour nor do these stories differ in aught but their supernatural nomencla ture froin the tales current in almost all

of the like ness between the basque and the rest of the european folktales seems at least simpler if spaniards and frenchmen borrowed their folktales of any length from the east of course the basques were likely to do the same there is not a single story of any length in the collections now before us for which either prof licbrecht or dr k61hler would be unable to quote close parallels from all parts of europe mr webster has been partly conscious of this and out of 218 pp 82 are devoted to  tales like the keltic and 33 more to  fairy stories derived directly from the french but if he had more often consulted what germans have written about popular tales lie would have seen that the tales of the west high lands and other similar stories from scotland ireland and brittany are not peculiar to kelts but are spread all over europe only once p 2 does he refer to a german book so we may infer that the special source of information on folktales has not been used by hiim and never does lie allude to any serious book on slavonic myih ology except m chodzkos now it is too much to expect that all comparative mythologists should be acquainted with slavonic tongues and it seems to be even too much to expect that they should be conscious of 1what has been done in the way of translations from the slavonic but unless a critic has studied what germany has taught his opinions on the mytlho logy of popular tales are apt to seenm less valuable to others than to hinmself he may be invaluable as a local collector or as an editor or translator of what others have gathered but he will act wisely if he keeps in reserve his ideas about the origin or the meaning of the stories he introduces to the world m cerquand observes a pleasing moderation in favouring us with his ideas about the

suggested explanation  of an example of what may be called atmospherical or climatological myths but we will dwell no longer on what seems to us the one drawbiack to mr websters book we would not have alluded to it at all so grateful do we feel for what he has done aright were it not necessary to take every opportunity of warning collectors of local tales against attempting to explain them unless they have fitted themselves by special study for that arduous task much better is it to keep to facts than to venture on fancies all the trust worthy information which can be given about

tales to work upon we have already said that the stories or at least the longer ones have nothing new about them so far as their incidents are concerned but their supernatural agents are interesting

mechanically chews the four seeds which he finds in his hair while scratching his head to stimulate his wits whereupon the demon disappears thenceforth the man never left his house without having

 he has eaten something tell him that i will return but tell tell him i beg you to eat nothing in ordinary versions of the tale the hero is sent to sleep by a malicious magician but in the basque story the mere act of eating appears to pro duce upon him an effect not altogether unknown among ourselves another strange idea is that of the basques that no work ought to be done by nightout of

B7585,['6637042'],  malay sketches by frank athelstane swettenham john lane mr swettenham tells us in the preface to his informing sketchbook that he has aspired and aspired solely  to awaken an interest in an almost undescribed but deeply interesting peoplethe dwellers in one of the most beautiful and least known countries in the east he disclaims any intention of writing a book of travels in the ordinary sense and has aimed at presenting malay character faithfully without embellishment and without adventitious colouring it may be said that he has succeeded admirably in his undertaking so that although his sketches are not exactly tales they are as full of interest as the best of short stories could possibly be it is true they are not of equal merit sometimes the author displays the prentice hand  as in one of the largest of the sketches  the passing of penglima prang semacen which is decidedly prosy and involved though valuable as supplying evidence of malay character in which regard it is quite as worthy of our respect as any of the rest indeed apart from their artistic worth the volume is to be heartily commended because it is destined to prove a trustworthy record of malay life and character when the destructive influences of western civilisation shall have obliterated the distinctive features of the race as touching this contingency mr swettenham writes feelingly malaya he says raising his voicea prophetically land of the pirate and the amok your secrets have been well guarded but the enemy has at last passed your gate and soon the irresistible juggernaut of progress will have penetrated to your remotest fastness slain your beasts cut down your forests  civilised your people clothed them in strange garments and stamped them with the seal of a higher morality mr swettenhams first sketch deals with the  real malay and an extremely realistic picture it is in some of his qualities it seems that he resembles the englishman who will recognise kindred spirits in a nation fond of gambling cockfighting and fieldsports he is by nature a sportsman and is thoroughly at home in a boat on the other hand he differs widely from the english race in that he never drinks intoxicants he is a muhammadan and a fatalist but he is also very superstitious mr swettenham describes graphically that peculiar form of homicidal mania called by us  running amuck common to most eastern peoples but of especial frequency among the malays but mengamok idiosyncratic though it be is not so abnormal a development as the strange disease of frequent occurrence among the malays called latah it appears that no english authority has attempted to diagnose this uncanny complaint or to attempt its cure we must commend its victims to lombroso nordau and the alienists generally for it would seem to have its origin in nervous and cerebral degeneration the author cites many instances of this peculiar malady and in regard to two men affected by it he says that it was only necessary to attract their attention by some simple means to look them hard in the face when they instantly lost all control of themselves and would do not only whatever they were told to do but whatever was suggested by a sign  the eternal feminine  treats of a woman faithful to her spouse a white man unto death we are made to feel that this woman was exceptional rather than typical which was exactly what the writer intended us to understand it is an admirable little tale in the next in the noon of night mr swettenhams powers as a descriptive writer are fully demonstrated in this as in many of the sketches we are presented with pictures full of suggestive beauty and ripe with knowledge of the country described they charm us and rivet our attention one is tempted to quote to substantiate the statement this tale has also fine dramatic qualities though it is a pity mr swettenham should descend into cheap philosophising little short of drivel as he brings the sketch to a close there is again some delightful descriptive writing in  bez hautu where the author dallies lovingly with  the exquisite feathery fronds of the bamboo with the orchards ricefields and glistening rivers fading into mistenshrouded forest he is no less felicitous in drawing for us portraits of the malay boy  a thing of wonderful eyes eyelashes and eyebrows with a faraway expression of sadness and solemnity as though he had left some better place for a compulsory exile on earth and of the malay girl proud of a wealth of straight black hair of a spotless olive complexion of the circle of her browlike a onedayold moonof the curl of her eyelashes and of the dimples in cheek or chin admirable descriptions of tiger hunts fishing picnics and other native functions  and institutions conspire to put us in a good humour with the author one feels that he is a keen observer a true and seasoned philosopher when he keeps away from moralising that he is in short a man one could sit with profitably

sorely aggrieved because mr dickens is not so inhuman as to be absolutely faultless some suggest modifications and point out how they would have planned it if it had been theirs to write some are in raptures over one part some over another and some very particular fellows are carping at every part the judgments on lileah house are in short as various as judgments are apt to be upon a man whoso failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him and his books are bought and read by everybody that this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of its readers with new groups of people as familiar and real as any that in life they may have known  that it overflows with inimitable grace and tenderness that it is stored with the most subtle wit and with a humour hearty and true that sets always instinctively at work our pleasantest and kindliest emotions  that mirth and pathos abound in it that its satire is always just and manly and that it is full of generous indignation against social usages that create wrong and perpetuate suffering among usis simply in other words to say that it is a book written by mr

same spirit fielding wrote treating his tom jones as an epic upon this high ground we must stand if we would properly discuss lileah house it touches and amuses us but it is destined to draw teare and smiles also from our childrens children mr dickens has a large public in the present and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future the world will grow wiser than it is the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappearbut the spirit in which he writes and to which he appeals is indestructible  and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah house has relation to its plot the conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole und to interfere with though steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue but let us in the present instance with no less justice remark that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole the studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah house is very manifest event leads to event and chance words or though deeds of chance people that seem perfectly irrelevant are seen everywhere precisely as in real life exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death of happiness or misery to men and women perfectly unknown to them taking the mere surface view of such treat ment it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connexion and design and to display in the j attempt only our own very real want of sagacity this subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents is in fact truer to nature infinitely truer than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world its drawback is that it compels the uso tf a huge number of characters which come and go during though progress of the story  und j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journeys end over the  ground he has traversed they may now and then cause some j confusion in the readers mind mid produce an etlect like j that of an overcrowded picture 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault  he this as it may never in any former work has mr j dickens made use of a plot so evidently planned before hand with minute consideration or throughout so elaborately studied even the lits of the little lawstationers servant aid directly in the chain of little things that lead indirectly to though catastrophe of lady dedlocks death so dexterously indeed an the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah house that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them as a mere cloud of isolated incidents a novel j may havo its too superficial readers as life has its too hasty obsorvers at though closo of his preface mr dickens marks incidcii tally the general character of the tale by the intimation thatj in it ho has purposely dwelled upon the romantic side of i familiar things marvellous is the skill with which towards j this intention though great chancery suit on which the plot hinges and on incidents connected with which important or trivial all though passion and suffering turns is worked into j every part of the book

to have made the plot itself a connected story of a chancery suit would havo beeu except for though merest commonplace ono of though clumsiest and most impracticable designs conceivable mr dickens knew hotter what he was alout and though use made of jarndyco v jamdyco in lileah house is always complete and masterly fjthe other grand feature of the tale connected also closely yet quito naturally with this is the dedlock household lt is brought out with equal power with the same thoughtful elaboration aud with as perfect a result not only have we sir leicester a truo gentleman with all his weaknesses and lady dedlock the supercilious woman of fashion with a busy heart painfully throbbing beneath that hard and quiet outside but yolumnia and though cousins the town house and the footmen thc country house and ita good oldfashioned housekeeper all aro worked out with the finish of a master from the first glimpse of the assembled dedlock household discussing the doodles and foodies and

aud construction absolutely wonderfulthe power aud care spent upon though group are unceasingly exerted yet so successfully as to bear no trace of effort to keep it throughout iu that central position towards which the other sections of though tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge taking the story piecemeal as a mero gallery of pictures and persons we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah house finer than anything that even mr dickens has yet produced in the same way exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former writings wo can remember none by which we have been touched so deeply or that has been graced by so much of the very finest writing as though entire tale of the streetwandering joe as it may be gathered from the pages of the book before us in though trooper george though ragnets and their humble household we have another of those fine broad hearty exemplifications of humour in which mr dickens delights in which all though ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all nothing is repulsive  everything is large laughable and true and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness the character of esiher summerson has been much elaborated and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything mr dickens has ever writtenindeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it full as it is of noble fancies and delicate and graceful thoughts but wo suspect that mr dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities we cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone which if not selfconsciousness is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of though character depicted yet the graces and virtues of esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them  and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues mrs jelly by and her despondent husband her daughter caddy and though turveydrops the trooper george and his man phil the brickmakers wives and the dead infant the lawstationer and his little woman roy thorn and ski dipole mr chadband and the coavinses the mother of mr  uppy the inscrutable and impassable tulkinghorn to say nothing of 1 poor miss flite or the immortal bucket and a dozen others j have been added here to the long list of ideal people with j whom mr dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted mr dickenss characters as all the world knows pass their names into our language and become types lt is  an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature to personify some main idea which are ever after found universally applicable such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since though beginning of all literature they know little how much there is in any ono mans head or heart who expect to have every i character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological  dissecting table and demonstrated minutely we see nobody minutely in real life the rough estimates we form of character aro on though whole if we possess any tact correct  but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes and it is the prominences the sharp i angles that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling hence it is therefore as well as for i other reasons that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters though rest ofthe sketch is filled iup by the reader or spectator instinctively and sufficiently i out of his own experience squire allworihy rlifil philosopher square parson adams trulliber and all the rest of fieldings characters were formed upon this plan  nor was it thought unjust or unnatural by the great novelist to give distinctness to thc picturo in each case by just so much of genial strength and breadth of colouring as should prevent his idea from being impressed too faintly on the public mind it is for the most part much more easy than correct to cry outexaggeration wo may be only betray ing our ignorance after all thero is an eastern saying to the effect that there is in the world precisely what the eye can find in it and let us not suppose that what limits our viewin any particular direction should of necessity be an equal restriction to thc view of a man of genius of mr dickens it is to bo said if of any oue that his main strength has lain in the ability to concentrate his thoughts on objects external to himself if his mero personality were at every turn set up as the limit aud bound to his perceptions if it were still his recurring habit to tako his own character as the infallible test of all other characters ho would in each fresh essay be always retracing only the old weary ground rut ready and cager at all times with genial warmth and fulness to enter in all the peculiarities of others we have him continually throughout his books apprehending and interpreting iew forms of character and truth and carrying with each new achievement of his

B8764,"['3184233', '6748866', '2446036', '2439391']",  ethan frome by edith wharton 3s 6d net mlac millan mrs wharton has more than satisfied ones expectation and her art has never been shown to greater advantage than in this story of ethan frome the young massachusetts farmer it is a tragedy almost unendurably poignant but justified by its inevitableness from his youth fate dealt hardly with ethan his father died leaving him a bleak unproductive farm and a failing sawmill after a lingering illness his mother also died that was in the fall had it been in the spring his future might have been different but ethan dared not face the winter alone in this  new england farmhouse that made the landscape lonelier then he took his first step towvard the abyss he asked zeena the tall uncomely rawboned woman who had nursed his mother to be his wife from that time his life was a martyrdom for zeena soon showved her real character as a sickly querulous neurotic then came the next stroke of destiny to save expense for the poverty at the farm was grinding mattie silver the penniless young cousin of zeena was invited to live with them as the girl served without pay her cousin suggested that on the rare occasions when there was an entertainment in the village mattie should go to it so that she should not feel too sharp a contrast between the life she had left and the isolation of the farm on these occasions ethan although at first he had inwardly demurred at the extra toil imposed on him was accustomed to fetch home his wifes cousin soon he found himself wishing that the village might give all its nights to revelry gradually the wifes suspicions are aroused a hired girl is employed and mattie must go poverty makes ethan helpless money might have saved two lives if not three but there is none so the blow falls in the last act that is to consign the three to a living death it is a beautiful sad but intensely human story working out to its final conclusion with all the inevitability of a great greek tragedy  ethan fromne by edith wharton macmillan 3s 6d net among modern american writers mrs edith wharton has long since attained a welldeserved reputation as one whose books are both in matter and manner far above the average she invariably compels attention and repays the attention which she thus forces in the coin of intellectual pleasure the present story is well suited to take its place beside mrs whartons previous volumes its extent is not considerable but mrs whartons very restraint in the matter of words has increased the power which she so ably wields her example might well be followed by many a novelist by whom superfluity of verbiage is almost acclaimed as a virtue many of them ought to be willing to sacrifice much in order to be able to produce a little tragedy of such power as this or to show themselves such masters of their common art as mrs whartons work repeatedly proves her to be the little story is a pure tragedy the scene is laid in a lonely semidesolate new england village which has been left aside in the modern march of progress here it is for the most part amidst the snowfor it is a commonplace in stackfield that no soul can survive many of its wintersthat the touching lifestory of ethan from is unfolded a victim of an unsuitable marriage suffering perpetually from the nagging and the querulousness of his invalid wife half of whose ills are rooted in imagination and are therefore all the worse to herself and all with whom she comes in contact for a moment happiness and romance play before him like a willothewisp ethan was not strong enough to seize them or perhaps we should say that circumstances were stronger than he not even the obvious halfconventional solution was permitted to him and ethan returns to life and the drabcoloured realities with his miseries increased a hundredfold and new agonies created of whichhe had previously been unconscious the only relief throughout the volume is the lovepassages and these are so vivid and so realistic that one forgets the shade out of which one passes in order to reach them and basking in their sunshine almost sees them pass before the physical eye the book is slight in form but in texture it is full  fiction ethan frome by edith wharton macmillan 3s 6d net in this small volume within the limits of a story half the length of an ordinary novel mrs wharton has done all and more than other novelists would have done in the greater space there is no living novelist who knows better how to construct a story the book is a model of compression every stroke tells every detail of conversation or incident has its essential place in the structure but the effect is not that of thin economy it is rich and full in the earlier part of the story there are incidents the suggestions of which are grimly and tragically realised in the conclusion mrs wharton has a skill which she can only have learned from the greek tragedians in preparing by dramatic contrasts irony and reversal of fortune for the passionate denouement but no skill alone could have produced such stress and tenseness such exaltation and depression so highly emotional a romance brought to the dust with realistic cruelty to mrs whartons vivid and romantic imagination is added a hard sense of fact conceive the elated moods of stevenson tempered by the grimmest touches of zola and you have the holocaust of romantic passion and horrid fact which mrs wharton can serve up to us she prepares us for the catastrophe from the beginning showing to us the old man ethan frome years  after the accident with the gash still showing on his forehead and his right side shortened and warped still living at the bleak solitary farmhouse on the hillside working his meagre farm coming in to starkfield rarely and speaking seldom for he has had troubles and the neighbours respect his gloom and then we see him in his youth aged twentyeight when the trouble is brewing his home is shared by two women one is his wife zeena older than himself who had nursed his dying mother whom he had married from sheer dread of solitude she is tall bony fretful a nalade imaginaire nursing herself on patent medicines her teeth are false she looks hideous in bed she complains at everything and nags mrs zeena from is shown in the fewest words of conversation and description but the portrait of this neurasthenic fixes itself on the mind a memorable thing the other woman is zeenas cousin mattie an orphan homeless she has been taken under zeenas roof to do the work of a hired girl without wages the situation is obvious enoughbut nothing is banal when it comes under mrs whartons hand ethan adores mattie a years companionship with two such women has wrought upon him in a sense it is a mere lovestory the love of ethan for a woman to whom he must not declare himself and the  this is our second notice of elhau frow love of mattie for ethan but it is a lovestory invested with the true tragic poignancy the two are only driven to selfrevelation by the jealousy and remorselessness of zeena for one day and night zeena goes away to see a doctor and hatch her plot in the evening ethan and mattie sit by the fire in the usual manner save that the seat of zeena is empty they talk about indifferent matters shyly and in dread of breaking the sweetness of their one evening they shun the name of zeena which creeps into their conversation hauntingly as a thing of dread and ethan sees mattie as she might be in his house were zeena dead we know no description of love equal to this in contemporary english or american literature since mr hardy was at his best every little thing that happens from the spreading of the table to the breaking of the picklepot is made ominous we will not tell how mattie is driven away by zeena how ethan takes her for the last time but one down the toboggan slide and how before the inevitability of parting they resolve on one more rush down the slope not past but into the dreaded elm we merely point out that this magnificent tempestuous passage concerning the lovers resolve to die is followed by the far grimmer conclusion the taking away of the two maimed but not dead bodies and the subsequent years of sinister grumbling and ugliness that is the way in which mrs wharton nerves herself to end her story it is the cruel modern way it is bitter it is almost intolerablefor we were absorbed in the fate of these personsbut it is brilliant  ethan frome by edith wharton macmillan and co 3s 6d net if one may judge by miss whartons story starkfield mass must be a very dreary place the story itself is another variation of the eternal triangle two women and a man with a rather good ending in that the man and the woman he ought to have married attempted to commit suicide in order to solve their difficulty and be at rest togetherand the attempt failed with such possibilities of psychological study as are presented by ethan from and zeena his wife to say nothing of mattie there was material for a great though somewhat sombre and tragic work miss wharton has suggested this and in the slight sketch which she has given of these three lives has conveyed a sense of reality with her pictures of american rural life,social
B2775,['9424844'],  christmas eve on lonesome by john fox jun constable  co mr fox has made some reputation as a successor to bret harte the decay of taste and criticism among the constantly increasing class of novelreaders may account for the success of an imitator whose imitation is so superficial  christmas eve on lonesome  has the sort of scenery and the sort of people that bret harte might have dealt with but it wants the qualities which made bret hartes work the work of an artist it is a story of unexceptionable character the story of a man who went to shoot his enemy but remembering something the prison chaplain had said held his hand it happened that the day was christmas eve but no one knew that it was matter such as this is inadequate for a story of real life in the wild parts of america or elsewhere it is mildly sentimental but not pathetic another story relates a comic incident in the great civil war it shows a good deal of appreciation of the ridiculous but a want of good taste there are subjects which ought not deliberately to be made use of for the purposes of jest among the remaining stories there is one whioh may be read with more satisfaction it is about a dog and it ends happily a word should be said in praise of the coloured illustrations they are exceedingly well drawn and reproduced,social

vividly as does the titlepage itself the tale is to centre round a womans life as did  romola and it opens with a  prelude in which the key of the fugue to follow is given in a short subtle harmony saint theresa  found her life but  many theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with the meanness of opportunity perhapg a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion with dim lights and tangled circumstance they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness  for these laterborn theresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other condemned as a lapse here then is the psychological thread of which the story is to be woven roughly there is truth in what would seem to be george eliots notion of the world for a man life is but a business nay even if he do his duty bravely and fight the devil with all his heart he fights much as if he were playing chess calmly calculating his moves resolved to win but prepared none the less to accept defeat if it come as a part of the order of that great game in which he knows himself to be but a pawn but with a woman if she do more than dress herself in silk and drop idly down with the current between unknown bankslife is a religion or rather a continuous act of passionate worship usually perhaps the soul contents itself with a narrow circle nor dreams of spheres beyond such a woman lives for and in her husband and her children and her life if not high is at least happy and true but few can even fancy what a woman suffers who through the darkness looks in vain for the light for the moral ideal which to a man as duty presents itself more or less in the cold intellectual aspect of abstract truth is

his conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather it was only safe to say that he would act with benevolent intentions and spend as little money as possible in carrying them out thus then dorothea brooke a girl not yet twenty lives a yearning unsatisfied life longing to do great good but ignorant of what good isexcept that it is a something beyond her sister and unknown to her uncle reading pascal and jeremy taylor and possibly thomas a kempis denying herself enjoyments from a sense of duty setting up sunday schools designing model cottages and tormented by vague longings by endless selfanalysis by ceaseless endeavours to answer the question what is truth  those provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her a standingground from which all truth could be seen more truly as it was she constantly doubted her own conclusions because she felt her own ignorance  how could she be confident that oneroomed cottages were not for the glory of god when men who knew the classics appeared to conciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal for the glory perhaps even hebrew might be necessaryat least the alphabet and a few rootsin order to arrive at the core of things and judge soundly on the social duties of the christian such being the girl it is clear that sir james chettam a typical young english gentleman manly simple not clever not learned a good son capable of becoming a good husband a lover of fieldsports and a kindly magistrate will have no chance with her  that he should even be regarded as a suitor to herself would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance dorothea with all her eagerness to know the truths of life retained very childlike ideas about marriage she felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious hooker if she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony or john milton when his blindness had come on  or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure but an amiable handsome baronet who said exactly to her remarks even when she expressed uncertainty how could he affect her as a lover  the really delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father and could teach you even hebrew if you wished it this kind of husband comes across poor dorotheas path mr casaubon is a strange compound of all thatto those who are old enough to tell true goldis not bad but hopelessly and achingly negative and repulsive he is rich and unimpeachableat once a country squire and a rector he has read by candlelight until he has ruined his eyes and  blinks  like a great owl but yet he is neither a learned man nor a wise man for  he had undertaken to show what indeed had been attempted before but not with that thoroughness justice of comparison and effectiveness of arrangement at which mr casaubon aimed that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally revealed he is not a boor but he is too selfconcentrated to be a gentleman in manner he is an insufferable and most overweening prigwhich is a positive trait in him and very pronounced his language is sesquipedalian his morality so sir james his rival saysis  a parchment code his age is sinking into sere and his physique especially in the matter of legs is atrocious mr casaubon however comes to dinner and dorothea at once makes a god of this great coarse splayfooted image of potters clay   seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapplegrey steed and weareth a golden helmet what i see answered sancho  is nothing but a man on a grey ass like my own who carries something shiny on his head just so answered don quixote  and that resplendent object is the helmet of mambrino the poor girl  looks deep into the ungauged reservoir of the pedants mind and sees reflected there in vague labyrinthine extension every quality she herself brought and so to make the story short mr casaubon who wants a wife partly as an amanuensis partly as a reader partly as a nurse offers his hand to dorothea deliberately and selfishly and is almost immediately accepted by that young lady to the infinite disgust and annoyance of ali those who have reason to love her what will come of this sad sacrifice it is not for us to even attempt to guess but that no good can come of it is only too clear we leave a young and noble girl daydreaming that she has found her milton in a dry old pedant who is  the centre of his own world who is liable to think that others are providentially made for him and especially to consider them in the light of their fitness for an author of the  key to all mythologies and yet the man is not a bad man he is only a lump of horribly disappointing negations whom we are expressly warned not to prejudge  if to dorothea mr casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight the fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions does it follow that he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned personages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him i protest against any absolute conclusion any prejudice derived from mrs cadwalladers contempt for a neighbouring clergymans alleged greatness of soul or sir james chettams poor opinion of his rivals legsfrom mr brookes failure to elicit a companions ideas or from celias criticism of a middleaged scholars personal appearance i am not sure that the greatest man of his age if ever that solitary superlative existed could escape these unfavourable reflections of himself in various small mirrors and even milton looking for his portrait in a spoon must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin moreover if mr casaubon speaking for himself has rather a chilling rhetoric it is not therefore certain that there is no good work or fine feeling in him and so dorothea and mr casaubon start for a wedding tour to rome and the rest of the volume is taken up with the doings of the chief families in middlemarchthe vineys the waules the bulstrodes the featherstones and other dramatis persona such as a country town affords this portion of  miss brooke calls back to us  the mill on the floss exactly as certain undertones in  miss brooke proper bring back memories of romola george eliot has a very subtle power of analysis and loves to follow and trace the windings of a dull common conscience properly anatomized the most tiresome of fools often proves to be fear folly and wonderfully made and even to have what he imagines to be his reasons for doing what he thinks right and in addition to a peculiarly penetrating analytic skill we need hardly be reminded that george eliot possesses an infinite fund of quiet dry humour together with a constructive ability which enables her by a few sharp short touches to strip a soul and place it before us with its vices and virtues in vivid clearness of outline and precision of detail mr brooke for instance occupies no small portion of the story but his character is summed up for us in a few lines on almost every page we know all about thc man at once when we find him at dinner across the walnuts and the wine informing the learned mr casaubon that the reformation either meant something or it did not that he himself was a protestant to the core but that catholicism was a fact and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a romanist chapel all men needed the bridle of religion which properly speaking was the dread of a hereafter i made a great study of theology at one time said mr brooke as if to explain the insight just manifested  i know something of all schools i knew wilberforce in his best days do you know wilberforcemr casaubon said nowell wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker  but if i went into parliament as i have been asked to do i should sit on the independent bench as wilberforce did and work at philanthropy mr casaubon bowed and observed that it was a wide field  yes said mr brooke with an easy smile  but i have documents equally incisively are the good people of middlemarch brought before us face to face there is mr standish the old lawyer who swears roundly  by god over his hosts dinnertable and  who had been so long concerned with the landed gentry that he had become landed himself and used that oath in a deep mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings stamping the speech of a man who held a good position there is mr chichely a middleaged bachelor and coursing celebrity who had a complexion something like an easter egg a few hairs carefully arranged and a carriage implying the consciousness of a distinguished appearance and above all there is mrs cadwallader the rectors wife who believed as unquestioningly in birth and nobirth as she did in game aud vermin she would never have disowned any one on the ground of poverty  a de braey reduced to take his dinner in a basin would have seemed to her an example of pathos worth exaggerating and i fear his aristocratic vices would not have horrified her but her feeling towards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred they had probably made all their money out of hih retail prices and mrs cadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid in kind at the rectory  such people were no part of gods design in making though world  and their accent was an affliction to the ears a town where such monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort of low comedy which could not be taken account of in a wellbred scheme of the universe but we hardly needed mrs cadwallader to salt chapters so full of savour and sparkling with such epigrams as that  charitable people never know vinegar from wine till they have swallowed it aud got the colic that brook is a very good fellow but pulpy he will run into any mould but he wont keep shape which is mr cadwalladers opinion of his neighbour and that somebody put a drop of his blood under a microscope and it was all semicolons and parentheseswhich is mrs cadwalladers opinion of mr casaubon nor can we refrain from mr standishs view of ventilation and diet and that sort of thing which is to the effect that  hang it it is not quite soundupsetting the old treatment which has made englishmen what they are and mr standishs criticisms suggest to us at once the dialogue between mrs cadwallader and lady chettam about the  complaint  of mrs renfrewa complaint  which puzzled the doctors and seemed clearly a case wherein the fullness of professional knowledge might need the supplement of quackery  where can all the strength of those medicines go my dear  said the mild but stately dowager turning to mrs cadwallader reflectively   it strengthens the disease said the rectors wife much too wellborn not to be an amateur in medicine  everything depends on the constitution some people make fat some blood and some bile thats my view of the matter  and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the mill then she ought to take medicines that would reducereduce the disease you know if you are right my dear and i think what you say is reasonable certainly it is reasonable you have two sorts of potatoes fed on the same soil one of them grows more and more watery ah  like this poor mrs renfrew that is what i think dropsy there is no swelling yetit is inward i should say she ought to take drying medicines shouldnt youor a dry hotair bath many things might be tried of a drying naturelet her try a certain persons pamphletssaid mrs cadwallader in an undertone seeing the gentlemen enter  he does not want drying we close miss brooke with only the ends in our hands of the tangled skein how it will unravel it is not possible to guess for hitherto we have had a mere study of character nor has the action of the piece properly begun the history of man is a mysterious mixture and behaves strangely under the varying experiments of time and the people of middlemarch loainshire ave so like ourselves that we can no more forecast their lives than our own nor tell how their natures will ve affected hythe tangled web of causes which influence thurn for evil or for good for dorotheas future we have much anxiety indeed but no fear celia her sister ought as a step in the fitness of things to become lady chettam but of the future of rosamond viney of mr lydgate of fred and of mary garth all is at present uncertain and we are left looking and waiting for the second part of  middlemarch as eagerly as we waited and looked for the first the english is george eliots own and never flags it is written with care and polished like steel so smoothly does it flow that it is only upon a dissection that each sentence reveals the labour with which it has been built indeed that george eliot writes and rewrites every page is but too clear from the many subtleties and allusions which are welded into the text with an art so consummate that it needs reflection to enable us to see that such farfetched after thoughts were never part of a first draught that mrs cadwallader should be a matchmaker was if all be considered only to be expected but we are further told that even with a microscope directed on a waterdrop we find ourselves making interpretations which turn out to be rather coarse  for whereas under a weak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity into which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so many animated taxpennies a stronger lens reveals to you certain tiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the swallower waits passively at his receipt of custom in this way metaphorically speaking a strong lens applied to mrs oadwalladers matchmaking will show a play of minute causes producing what may bo called thought and speech vortices to bring her the sort of food she needed and also that mrs cadwalladers mind was  active as phosphorus biting everything that came near into the form that suited it metaphors such as these farfetched somewhat strained and drawn by force from the most recondite arcana of chemistry and zoology are apt if indulged in to degenerate into mannerism we do not remember such in 4 romola but4 middlemarch is full of them they choke the mechanism of the english and they interrupt the thought george eliot ought to be far too selfpossessed to fall away into any such tricks of style but yet 4 middlemarch although not built upon the  romola lines fully sustains the reputation which culminated in 4 romola itself to say of george eliot that she is far the first english novelist is as english novelists go scant and inadequate praise the best and truest estimate of 4 middlemarch is to find that we test it not by the works of other hands but by other works from the same hand it is with the mill on the floss that its affinities are strongest and as far as we can at present judge those who remember george eliot in the one will not be disposed to think that she falls below herself in the other it is something for a writer to be assured that she will leave behind her a picture of a portion of her own times as vivid as if drawn by fieldingand far more worthy of life,social
B2674,['8949326'],  a diplomatists wife in many lands 2 vols by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson  co animated and rather indiscreet these reminiscences should secure a wide public more especially as beneath their sparkle there lies much sound reflection mrs hugh fraser who is the daughter of a wellknown american sculptor a sister of the accomplished novelist marion crawford and the wife of an english diplomatist has enjoyed an unusual upbringing during a girlhood spent in italy she acquired an intimate acquaintance with society as it existed before the achievement of political unity and she remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order her arguments do not always carry persuasion but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion it had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority thus gregory xvi displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green turkish trousers whatever the rest of their costume might be and by swaddling the figures on the tomb of paul iii in casttin draperies painted to match the colour of the marble  officials if prince massimo can be taken as a type were not overscrupulous  he was for many years postmastergeneral and utilised hh facilities to make a valuable collection america was a long way off frcm rome at that time  and every letter that my people received from the united states had had the ste mps boldly cut out of the envelope before it was handed over to the postman we get a pretty picture of priestly discipline in the alban hills  the great preoccupation in the castelli as the mountain villages are called is to keep the girls out of harms way i have heard the preacher say to the women 4 never mind about the men they were mado of different stuff to you  they can be sometimes bad and sometimes good but you cannot a woman must be either an angel or a devil there is no place between for her  the good priest therefore used to make them work in the fields in twos and threes and he would count them at the entrance of the town when they returned to see that no girl was loitering alone mrs fraser does not pay compliments to those whom others would call the liberators of italyvictor emmanuel for instance farini and garibaldi but we do not understand why a mystery should be mode of  garibaldis englishman his name was john whitehead peard he was a member of a wellknown west country family and he died in 1880 mrs fraser is definite however about that staunch champion of the temporal power cardinal antonelli whom she draws with vigorous strokes  44 in appearance he was a typical south italian small in build darkskinned with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell nothing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them his face wes meant to be mobile but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour he was a rapidly fluent talker and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us the italian chapters in this book are on the whole the most interesting but mrs fraser seems to have a happy knack of making amusing acquaintances wherever she goes she sits opposite a benevolent old gentleman at an hotel dinner and he reveals himself as edward lear the author of the book of nonsense a firm believer in ghosts she has collected some gruesome stories about them  and it appears that julius hare so excelled as a narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away in the second volume we are trans ported to peking and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two dowager empresses of whom the first died during the boxer rebellion whereupon the second who had been trained for the purpose promptly took her place mrs frasers argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than fortyfive or fifty and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate be that as it may she illustrates the pride of the chinese by a significant story  after the looting of the palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the imperial family through the chinese ambassador take them away exclaimed the minister they are desecrated filthywe never want to see them again mrs fraser concludes with vienna from 1880 to 1882 she does not spare the court and some of her stories about the empress are a little unkind she writes of the unfortunate however in a chivalrous spirit notably of benedek the defeated at sadowa whom she considers to have been the victim of the incompetence of others and who went to the grave without an attempt to exculpate himself in taking leave of these agreeable volumes we may remark that it was sir henry wotton not sir thomas more

B5653,"['8831810', '6655091', '3180846']",  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen  co realism is so often an excuse for immorality in what is called art that one can gladly praise mr arthur morrison for a realism which deals frankly with dirt brutality and crime his story is without plot a mere straightforward chronicle of a mt of life in the lowest class at the eastend of london it is told with great vigour and with powerful simplicity the author must no doubt seem to many to dwell too minutely upon details of fighting and to be tempted at times into exaggeration in the following horrible account of an affray between women the reader can hardly fail to mark the zest of the narrator norah walsh vanquished champion now somewhat recovered looked from a window saw her enemy vulnerable and ran out armed with a bottle she stopped at the kerb to knock the bottom off the bottle and then with an exultant shout seized sally green by the hair and stabbed her about the face with the jagged points blinded with blood sally released her hold on mrs perrott and rolled on her back struggling fiercely  but to no end for norah walsh kneeling on her breast stabbed and stabbed again till pieces of the bottle broke away the human frame can bear a great deal but if this description is taken literally it is pretty clear that sally must have been killed on the spot at another place it is said that a constable was laid low by a firegrate adroitly let drop from an upper window laid low may of course mean killed but if so the author for once fails to choose the plainest word if it does not the exaggeration is palpable many pages are devoted to elaborate accounts of free fights and one chapter describing a single combat furnishes the most disgusting passages in the book what is the object of it all those who have to pass their time in police courts or in the central criminal court know very well that villainy such as mr morrison depicts and worse exists in london the clergy of all denominations the officers of the chanty organisation society mr waughs society for protecting children and other societies and many philanthropists who work in the eastend have certainly not uah remiss in letting the world know what jsj on in places like the jago mr sorrison has nothing new to tell he is lycastic about the philanthropists who surely do not deserve his sarcasm if his aim is to beguile novelreaders into taking interest in the slums it is not to be commended the facts are known attempts have been made to attack the evils by rousing excited sentiment better directed efforts are not wanting and those who are in earnest must deplore the method of the novelist who dwells upon revolting details of blood and blows if the example of dickens is pleaded as a precedent it must he remembered that dickens went straight to a definite point and had something to reveal with mr morrison it is not so fortunately there is one bright spot in his pages he sincerely admires his father gturt who labours without much success hut with fine courage and perseverance the dedication of the book to mr jay the vicar of holy trinity shoreditch suggests an explanation of the word  jago  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen mr arthur morrison has drawn upon fresh material for this powerful and unequal story it is a steep desoent from the mean streets to the jago one to be indicated by a considerable deepening of the tints upon that lurid map of mr charles booths it means all the difference between respectability as an ideal rarely attained to and respectability as the memory of an ideal long ago forsaken for in the jago for one hundred years the blackest pit in london you touch the very bottom of the social scale the ultimate dregs and offscourings of humanity dealing thus as it now does with the extremes of filth and rapacity and cruelty mr morrisons style has dropped something of its old effectiveness powerful it is still and grimly humorous and scrupulously faithful but the quality of tragic restraint so noticeable in the earlier book has hardly fair play among conditions where the sheerest fidelity of expression can only read like extravagance tragedy indeed is wellnigh impossible in the jago for want of that conflict between good and evil out of which tragedy essentially springs there is no good at these levels to count for anything we are bound to say that we think there are passages in mr morrisons book where the brutality exceeds the limits of art the account for instance of the street fight between sally green and norah walsh is a thing which like certain scenes in le debdcle and one or two exceptional stories of mr kiplings stirs not the imagination but the gorge nevertheless it is in many ways a book of extraordinary merit for the remorseless vigour of the descriptions and for the dramatic power with which the writer has conceived entered into and maintained throughout the jago point of view to put this squalid record of robbery and murder as they are side by side with the fagin and bill sykes scenes in oliver twist is to get an object lesson on the difference between the realistic and the romantic conceptions of fiction mr morrisons genius we think is rather for the episodic than for the epic the book would have held together better if attention had been concentrated throughout upon dicky perrott who is admirably done and not divided as it is at the end between him and his villainous father mr weech the   fence who narks  and gets the reward of a  nark is a creation conscious that his picture is lacking in high lights he has introduced an heroic parson the rev henry sturt but the rev henry sturt has as little to do in the book as he was able to do in the jago and his real function seems to be to afford an opportunity for mr morrison to express his preference for the methods of the church in the slums over those of general booth or of toynbee hall  a child of the jago0   people are so very genteel arent they     but hang it all men like ourselves neednt talk as though the world was built of hardbake its a mighty relief to speak truth with a man who knowsa man not rotted through with sentiment by the mouth of the jago surgeon mr morrison has expressed his own attitude the mild sugary speech of philanthropists the comfortable complacency of westend slummers the blind absurd enthusiasm that looks to make the eastend into paradise by culturehe turns and rends them all for he knows that they have not seen have not dared to see the black slough of sin and cruelty and unspeakable wrong that lies beyond their efforts and their courage woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing  because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered mortar say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye 0 great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it it is an attitude only tolerable to the courageous it is a knowledge that would kill if it were forced on the feeble but the attitude and the knowledge must be a part of any true understanding of the world as it is made it is a recognition of a state of things desperate but not entirely hopeless he gives us dicky a young thief a man of the world an evil world at ten yet staunch spirited responsible and he sends father sturt in our way probably to show the kind of temper that has any chance of redeeming the dwellers in such a place of crime and misery sturt has no illusions he knows the worst of the district he has tenacity courage a keen sense of humour and cannot be humbugged it is no use paying mr morrison compliments at this time of day on his vigour and his unusual ability these must be everywhere acknowledged they are acknowledged by us very heartily but this new book of his has pages which it is almost impossible to read we do not combat his general attitude at all he does not pretend to tell the whole tale of eastend misery which has its genteel sides of course but he tells one awful chapter of it and we respect his sense of responsibility in doing so however much he shatters our complacency and our shallow convictions that alls right with the world we do not accuse him of exaggeration and as to his excesses of realism we can at least understand the temptation but to understand does not take away the right of protest and we do protest against the useless riot of brutality the orgies of physical violence which we are made witnesses of if we read the book through zola has never outdone some of the pages here in their horrible defiance of any sensitive feelings we may have but we declare our right to have these feelings respected if not pampered and our opinion that an unblinking perusal of these tales of brutal fights would show much more morbid efleminacy than any shrinking from them would do they are no necessary part of mr morrisons strenuous and courageous purpose but we must not part from the book with a censure for dicky the hero must be given his due in the midst of the sordid cruel desperate jago he grows up unashamed of it accepting its conditions ambitious of its honours a plant of the hideous soil yet a sturdy not unwholesome plant he has affection loyalty and endless courage mr morrison killed him not for the sake of his pathetic deathscene we are sure but because he loved him and his heart  1 a child of the jago by arthur morrison 6s methuen revolted against the thought of the lads ingenuity hardening into ugly craft his brave philosophy into callousness his daring into insolent crime and so he lets the child of the jago die in no odour of sanctity to be sure but round the little outcast from all that is respectable he has woven a halo of charm,social
B1466,['8469993'],  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival,social

his part well and much lessens our reirnt at the want of mr seymours spirited hand  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited toy boz london chapman and hall 186 strand wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughterloving mortals these memoirs contain some account of the adventures of mr pickwick the founder and messrs tupman winkle and snodgrass three of the members of the club in search not of the picturesque like dr syntax but of information concerning men and manners for the instruction and edification of the members of the society of course the story is merely a framework in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befell these gentlemen in the course of their travels the comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts and for poetry at least poetry of a serious character we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever to borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the  joy green when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse its a very slight affair and the only excuse i have for having ever perpetrated it is that i was a young man at the time the style of ideas brought into fashion bv monk lewis and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of barry cornwall has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste and consigned to the  tomb of all the capulets  and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of thomas moore are excused only by their exquisite matter or by the kwill which h rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords but such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of longtried ingenuity having thus blamed what we consider blameable it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise the scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause the mind which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein a scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house not a hundred miles from westminsterbridge is well worthy of perusal and in short if we were to particularise all that is good we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest we should reprint half of the contents we give one extract which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the pickwick club and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers shops we have passed for some time since it should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish seymour but since his lamented and premature death they have been of course transferred to another operator the portion we have chosen is a description of the chain of untoward circumstances by which mister weller boots of the

married and mr pickwick settled took lodgings at richmond where he has ever since resided he walks constantly on the terrace during the summer months with a youthful and janty air which has rendered him the admiration ofthe numerous elderly ladies of single condition who reside in the vicinity he has never proposed again mr bob sawyer having previously passed through the gazette passed over to

his word and remained unmarried for two years the old housekeeper dying at the end of that time mr pickwick promoted mary to tbt situation oa condition of her marrying mr weller at once which she did without a murmur from the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden we have reason to suppose that sam has some family the elder mr weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire the contents of the pocketbook had been so well invested for him however by mr pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent publichouse near shooters hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with mr pickwick and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows mr pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing sam weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind which never failed to afford mr pickwick great amusement he was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy mr snodgrass mr winkle and mr trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to mr jingle for both that person and job trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations he is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit aad may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the dalwieh gallery or enjoying n walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day ha is known by nil the poor people about who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect the children idolise him nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood every year he repairs to a large family merrymaking at mr wardlea on this as on all other occasions he is invariably attended by the faithful sam between whom and his master there exists a steady aad reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will saver a preface which touches on some of the difficulties the author has had to contend with in his undertaking and a dedication are given in the last number the dedication is to mr sergeant talfourd  mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country and of the lasting benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their works  the posthumous papers ofthe pickwick club edited by boz jno viii chapman and hall we continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy original and unaffected powers displayed in them we should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome there is no flagging in this number before us every stroke of the writers humour the most common or the most careless tells to a desired effect and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous is thoroughly mastered here we should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the comic tn the heartrending calamities of common life as in its sidesplitting oddities and humours the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled the number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old lawclerk on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old inns of court mr pickwick stares at him in silence the old gentleman resumes with a leer   look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic  what fine places of slow torture they are think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him the waitingthe hopethe disappointmentthe fearthe miserythe poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his careerthe suicide perhaps or better still the shabby slipshod drunkard am i not righi about them eh  and the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject mr pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence  talk of your german universities said the little old man pooh pooh theres romance enough at home without going half a mile for it  only people never tb ink of it  i never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said mr pickwick laughing  to be sure you didnt  said the little old man a of course not as a friend bit of it said he he died one morningw  his outer door fell with his head in his own letterbox and there he lay for eighteen months everybody thought he had gone out of town  and how was he found at last  hundred mr

ehich always preceded his entering into conversation with his master u it is not indeed som replied mr pickwick surveying the crowded j jhy street through which they were passing  its a wery remarkable circumstance sir said sam  that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together u l dont underataad you sam said mr pickwick a what i mean sir said sam  is that the poorer a place is the greater call there seems to be for oysters look here sir heres a oyster stall to efery halfdozen housesthe streets lined vith ern blessed if i dont think that ven a mans wery poor he rushes out of his lodgings and eats oysters in reglar desperation  to be sure he does said mr weller senior  and its just the same vith pickled salmon  those are two very remarkable facts which never occurred to me before aid mr pickwick  the very first place we stop at ill make a note of by this time they had reached the turnpike at mile end a profound silence prevailed until they had got two or three miles further on when mr weller senior turning suddenly to mr pickwick said  wery queer life is a pikekeepers sir  a what  said mr pickwick  a pikekeeper  what do you mean by a pikekeeper  inquired mr peter magnus  the old un means a turnpikekeeper genlmn observed mr weller in explanation  oh said mr pickwick  i see yes very curious life very uncomfortable  theyre all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said mr weller senior  ay ay   said mr pickwick  yes consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls n deat me said mr pickwick  i never knew that before  fact sir said mr weller  if they was genlmn youd cali era misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pikekeepin all this is excellent but the wit of boz excellent as it is has not exhausted this subject of turnpikes he may return to it with some effect we look upon it as only another strong proof of their misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind that they are specially called trusts because they all declare  no trust it is malice and false pretence the elder mr weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son we will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to sam when he is obliged to resume the reins for london   pm a goin to leave you samivel my boy and theres no telling ven i shall see you again your motherinlaw may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened

yourself and youll be glad on it afterwards with these affecting words mr weller looked steadfastly on his son nnd turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight we see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the papers of the pickwick  the posthumous papers of the pickwickian club indited by bo and the library of fiction  or lui utily story teller boz marches on triumphantly and has completely taken possession of the ear and of the hearts too of his countrymen his fifth number is joyous in the scenes of a contested election and the honest wonder and indignation ol the great mr pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming the contents of the  story teller  this month are all good and two of the pieces are original the one jesse chile by miss mitford and  the alchymist by mr harvey this is really a great advance upon the last hoing thus this periodical cannot fail to do well  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club  containing a faithful record of thc perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions of the correspotiding members edited by boz with illustrations the public have now had a full dozen of these papers and they are cager for a dozen more they seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed instead of flagging they grow more uproarious in their fun and more rich in their drollery we like this number the best of any that have yet appeared still it has a striking fault and we shall take this opportunity of reading master boz a friendly lecture in public that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private when he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of everyday life he should always be not only strictly possible but even probable thus if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera we give him a little latitude as to his proportions and the free use of his colours  but should he choose to paint a pig it must be a pig and nothing else but a pig that he paints or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure the trial scene that makes the interest of this volume is as familiar to his readers as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty  and everybody who reads it knows badly as much of our judicature is conducted that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced this is a pity inasmuch as it has no thing to do with the humour of the proceedings if it were necessary for the following out of the story that the venerable and muchtobeidolized pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages the evidence against him should have been made strongerthe misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away however ull this may not have struck the million but we will still maintain that however wild may be the fiction or rampant the humour of a literary production all the groundwork upon which it is erected such as the face of the country the manners of the time and the operations of public institutions should be strictly in accordance with truth  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club containing a faithful record of the perambulations ptriis travels adventures and sporting transactions of the corresponding members edited bv box with illustrations boz iroes on triumphing and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct the seventh number of this pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six the sporting excursion on the 1st of september which was undertaken with all the strength of the club still more strong in its adjutant sam weller is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read the impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow among the pigs and the asses in the tillage receptacle for the wandering is a happy hit and though a most powerful still a most probable one for quiet humour and keen satirical acumen the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed the next number promises us a rich treat wo are just admitted into the vestibule with the foldingdoors partially opened that are to disclose some rich scenesupon which we are impatient to enter  posthumous

illustrations very good this number the eleventh indeed sam weller improves upon acquaintance the world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular the renowned mr pickwick is himself the legitimate successor to don quixote  indeed he is the cockney quixote of the nineteenth century and instead of armour of iron he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat and instead of spear and sword has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler the wrongdoer and the oppressor of the innocent wc wish that the humorous boz would call to mind that the knight of la mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame we should like to see mr pickwick confess to the soft impeachment this gentlemans attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heartwe trust that it will not ascend to his head but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these pickwickian papers  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited by boz no ix chapman and hall this is the best pickwick we

magistrate going as dont commit himself twice as often as he commits other people at this sally another special laughed and then tried to look so tuperoatu rally solemn that the magistrate detected him immediately an inimitably humorous passage ensues in which it appears eer tain that the inst named unlucky special must have been committed  only that mr jinks who is the magistrates adviser having bad k legal education of three years in a country attorneys office whispers the magistrate that bc thinks it wouldnt do and so mr nop kins makes a speech and says that in consideration of the

true to nature than these extracts we have given we have great pleasure in quoting this just tribute to geuius from blackwoods magazinebut blackwood bas always had a generous sympathy with talent aod genius for its great writer is himself of the brotherhood44 but there are higher works of which twill be our hint to speakworks of poweray of geniussnd we must begin with bulwer his tame is fixed and on a wide foundation in his provinceand it is a noble oneis be since the death of the unapproachable u the foremost man of all the world   thc easiest and shortest way to prove that he is not would be to show who is privileged to take precedence ofthe author of paul cu ff tr j and eugene aram washington irving no cooper no his name does not occur to us at this moment but perhaps we may find it in the london beview  that posthumous payers of the pkhtrick cm edited by box no 7 chapman and hall this is beyond a doubt the most original and amusing series of comic sketches that have been published in our time and we are inclined to think the present number so far as they have gone the best of them the jest is kent up with excellent breadth of humour and a most studied insight into the niceties and peculiarities of character scene after scene is worked out as if on the spur of the occasion without much appearance of any previous bias or ultimate purpose but always broadly and powerfully and from a rich rein of comic invention the style continues racy and unaffected the writer reminds us frequently in his ingenuity in the vivacity of his talents in the wonderful local truth of his pictures and in the general accuracy of his observation and humour as well as in the ease and animation of his manner of the elder english comedies and farces he has a share of the ludicrous invention of vanbrugh and touch of the higher powers of wycherley the number before us opens with a serious imputation on the character of mr winkie whose friendly attentions to mrs pott the wife of the redoubted editor of the eatanstrill gazette were remarked upon in a previous number as mr winkle is sitting in mr potts breakfast room in all the unconscious simplicity of perfect innocence mr p enters and calls him a  serpent mr w very naturally supposes this to be a piece of pleasantry we recommend what follows to the reader in the hope that none of our contemporaries will suppose its allusions levelled at them   pleasantry sir  exclaimed pott with a motion of the hand indicative of a strong desire to hurl the britannia metal teapot at the head of his visitor u pleasantry sir but no i will be calm swill be calm sir and in proof of his calmness mr pott flung himself into a chair and foamed at the mouth  my dear sir interposed mr winkle  dear sir  replied pott  how dare vou address me as dear sir sir  how dare you look me in the face and do it   well sir if you come to that responded mr winkle  how dare yon look me in the face and call me a serpent sir   because you are one replied mr pott  prove it sir said mr winkle warmly  prove it a malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the independent of that morning and laying his finger on a particular paragraph threw the journal across the table to mr winkle that gentleman took it np and read as follows   our obscure and filthy contemporary in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood to the personal affairs of our late candidateaye and notwithstanding his base defeat we will add our future member mr fizkin what does our dastardly contemporary mean  what would the ruffian say if we setting at naught like him the decencies of social intercourse were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule not to say from general execration  what if we were even to point ont and comment on facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious and beheld by every one but our moleeyed contemporarywhat if we were to print the following effusion which we received while we were writing the commencement of this artiele from a talented fellowtownsman and correspondent    lines to a brass pot   oh pott if youd known how false shed hare grown when you heard the marriage hells tinkle youd have done then i vow what you cannot help now and handed her over to w     v   what said mr pott solemnly what rhymes to  tinkle villain   what rhymes to tinkle  said mrs pott whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply  what rhymes to tinkle  why winkle i should conceive and saying this mrs pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed pickwickian and extended her hand towards him the agitated young maa would have accepted it in his confusion had not pott indignantly interposed  back maamback said the editor  take his hand before my very face ln  mr p said his astonished lady  wretched

ingenious young man that sam said mr pickwick with a slight shudder  just was sir replied mr weller continuing his occupation of emptying the basket  and the pies was beautiful we began by describing an imputation on the character of mr winkle and we regret to say that before the number closes mr pickwick himself plays some opening passages in the part of defendant in an action for  breach of promise his visit to the office of messrs dodson and fogg is inimitably toldthe sketch of the clerks is finished adunguem but we must pass these and also the sharp lineaments of captain boldwig and likewise the choice spirits assembled at the magpie and stump for the purpose of introducing the father of mr weller and the scene of his affectionate recognition sam and mr pickwick have turned in for a few minutes to a house of refreshment by way of relief from thc toils of a very anxious afternoon m the room was one of a very homely description and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen for several gentlemen who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession were drinking and smoking in the different boxes among the number was one stout redmeed elderly man in particular seated in an opposite box who attracted mr pickwicks attention the stout man was smoking with great vehemence but between every halfdozen puffs he took his pipe from nis mouth and looked first at mr weller and then at mr pickwick then he would bury in a juart pot as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving and take another look at sam and mr pickwick then he would take another halfdozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again and at last the stout man putting up his legs on the eat and leaning his back against the wall began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all and to stare through the smoke at the new comers as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them at first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped mr wellers observation but by decrees as he saw mr pickwicks eyes every now and then turning towards lum he began to gaze in the same direction at the same time shading his eyes with nis hand as if he partially recognised the object before him and wished to make quite sure of its identity his doubts were speedily dispelled however for the stout man having blown a thick cloud hom his pipe a hoarse voice like some strange effort of ventriloquism emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest and slowly uttered these sounds vy sammy  whos that sam  inquired mr pickwick  why i wouldnt ha believed it sir replied mr weller with astonished eyes  its the old un  old one said mr pickwick  what old one    my father sir replied mr weller  how are you my ancient and with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection mr weller made room on the seat beside him fbr the stout roan who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand to greet him  vy sammy said the father  i hant seen you for two years and better  nor more you have old codger replied the son  hows mother in law    vy ill tell you what sammy said mr weller senior with much solemnity in his manner  there never was a nicer woman as a widder than that ere second wentur o minea sweet cretur she was sammy and all i can say on her now is that aa she was such an uncommon pleasant widder its a great pity ahe ever changed her condition she dont act as a vife sammy  dont she though   inquired mr weller junior the elder mr weller shook his head as he replied with a sigh ive done t once too often sammy ive done it once too often the illustrations are excellent they are quite equal to the best attempts of mr seymour in the early numbers  the posthumous pt

of receiving them at the beginning of each month but the race is all in favour of the pickwick club elderly though its members be and very obese its renowned chairman and sundry of its members  bo is making for himself a standard fame and this number is perhaps the best that luis yet appeared the witjif these papers is subtle and beneath the surface  their humour is not that of extravagance but of nature the laugh that the author has raised against the strenuous trilling oj antiquarianism is a fair laugh and it is exquisitely excited the whole thing is well clone and we shall say no more in the library of fiction the k diary of a surgeon does not improve  sandie saudeman the piper will be pleasing to a certain class of readers and of the nonoriginal papers we shall say nothing thc redeeming point of this number is tk the sybils stone by the author of the  gentleman in black though the idea has often been worked up before yet it is so pleasantly done that we do not regret its want of novelty we wish well to this periodical and we trust that in its next number it will put forth greater strength even the engravings are infinitely inferior to those of its pickwickian brother  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club by boz nos 1 to 6 chapman and hall as a lively caricaturist the author of these papers may take rank with some of the best comic writers in the language in hitting off the eccentricities of life few have excelled him his style is fresh and racy and has all the stamp of an original spirit the reader will thank us for the extracts we are about to make if he bas not already had the good fortune to meet with thc papers themselves the idea worked out is that of a  faithful record of the perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions ofthe corresponding members of a cockney club founded by mr pickwick  for the promotion of science thc advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning the corresponding members consist of thc illustrious founder himself whose character is sustained throughout with a very romantic gravity and of messrs tupman snodgrass and winkle who are respectively distinguished by admiration ofthe fair sex a taste for poetry and a sporting turn the different parties play upon one anothers failings and into one anothers handsthc plot of their adventures is kept up with infinite liveliness bustle point and interestand many neb sources of the truly ludicrous are opened tne nature of mr pickwicvs observations on the various towns that are visited may be gathered from an abridgment of what he

delicious to those who are extremely fend of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying our next extract is an admirable picture of a family party the travellers have been invited to the house of a goodhumoured country gentleman mr wardle some strokes of character in the following description of the scene of their reception are truly excellent for humour force and reality a very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gownno less a personage than mr wardle s motheroccupied the post of honour on the righthand comer of the chimneypiece and various certificates of her having been brought up ia the way ihe should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk teakettle holders of a more modern period the au ut the two young ladies and mr wardle each vying with the other in paving zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lad crowded round her easy chair one holding her eartrumpet another an orange and a third a smellingbottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support on the opposite side sat a baldheaded old gentleman with a goodhumoured benevolent facethe clergy noan of dingley dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery ot manufacturing homemade cordials greatly to other peoples satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own a little hardheaded ripstone pippinfaced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman n one corner ana two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat biltupright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mr pickwick and bis fellowvoyagers mr pickwick mother said mr wardle at the very top of his voice  ah maid the old lady shaking her head  i cant hear you  mr pickwick grandma  screamed both the young ladies together  ah  exclaimed the old lady well it dont much matter he dont grasping the old ladys hand care for an old ooman like me i dare say u i assure you maam said m r pickwick and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance  i assure vou ma am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well 44 ah  said the old lady after a short pause  its all very fine i dare ssy bot i cant bear him u grandmas rather put out now said miss isabella wardle in a low tone  but shell talk to vou presently mr pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle  delightful situation this said mr pickwick u delightful echoed messrs snodgrass tupman and winkle  welt i think it is said mr wardle  there aint a better ipot o ground in all kent sir said the hardheaded man with the pippinface there aint indeed sirfm sure there aint sir  and the hardheaded man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very muck contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last 44 there aint a better spot o ground in all kent said the hardheaded man again after a pause u cent mullins meadows observed the fat man solemnly u mullios meadows  ejaculated the other with profound contempt  ah mullins meadows repeated the fat man  heglar good land that interposed another fat man  and so it is surely said a third fat man  everybody knows that said the corpulent host the hardheaded man looked dubiously round but finding himself in a minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more  what are they talking about  inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice tor like roany deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself  about the land grandma  what about the land nothing the matter is there  u no no mr miller was saying our land was better than mullins meadows  how should he know anything about it  inquired the old lady indignantly u millers a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him i said so saving which the old lady ouite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper drew herself up and looked carvingknives at the hardheaded delinquent  come come said the bustling host with a natural anxiety to change the conversationu w hat say you to a

B808,"['8957194', '6810283', '3179671', '8892761', '6796313']",  the way of all flesh the way op all flesh by samuel butler 11th impression of 2nd edition fifield 6s 6d net the appearance of a new impression of  the way of all flesh  in mr fifields edition of samuel butlers works gives us an occasion to consider more calmly the merits and the failings of that entertainnig story like all unique works of authors who stand even to the most obvious apprehension aside from the general path it has been overwhelmed with superlatives the case is familiar enough and the explanation is simple and brutal it is hardly worth while to give it the truth is that although there is no inherent reason why the isolated novel of an author who devotes himself to other forms should not be  one of the great novels of the world the probabilities tell heavily against it on the other hand an isolated novel makes a good stick to beat the age it is fairly certain to have something sufficiently unique about it to be useful for the purpose even its blemishes have a knack of being sui generis to elevate it is therefor bound to imply the diminution of its contemporaries yet apart from the general argument there are particular reasons why the praise of  the way of all flesh  should be circumspect samuel butler knew extraordinarily well what he was about his novel was written intermittently between 1872 and 1884 when he abandoned it in the twenty remaining years of his life he did nothing to it and we have mr streatfeilds word for it that  he professed himself dissatisfied with it as a whole and always intended to rewrite or at any rate to revise it we could have deduced as much from his refusal to publish the book the certainty of commercial failure never deterred butler from publication  he was in the happy situation of being able to publish at his own expense a book of whose merit he was himself satisfied his only reason for abandoning  the way of all flesh  was his own dissatisfaction with it his instruction that it should be published in its present form alter his death proves nothing against his own estimate butler knew at least as well as we that the good things in his book were legion he did not wish the world or his own reputation to lose the benefit of them but there are differences between a novel which contains innumerable good things and a great novel the most important is that a great novel does not contain innumerable good things you may not pick out the plums because the pudding falls to pieces if you do in  the way of all flesh however a compere is always present whose business it is to say good things his perpetual flow of asides is pleasant because the asides are piquant and in their way to the point butlers mind being a good mind had a predilection for the object and his detestation of the rotunder platitudes of a greek chorus if nothing else had taught him that a cornerman should have something to say on the subject in hand his arguments are designed to assist his narrative  moreover they are sympathetic to thc modern mind an enlightened hedonism is about all that is left to us and butlers hatred of humbug is though a little more placid like our own we share his ethical likes and dislikes as an audience we are ready to laugh at his asides and on the first night at least to laugh at them even when they interrupt the play but our liking for the theses cannot alter the fact that  the way of all flesh  is a roman d thises not that there is anything wrong with the roman d theses if the theses emerge from the narrative without its having to be obviously doctored nor does it matter very much that a compere should be present all the while provided that he does not take upon himself to replace the demonstration the narrative must afford by arguments outside it but what happens in  the way of all flesh   we may leave aside the minor thesis of heredity for it emerges gently enough from the story besides we are not quite sure what it is we have no doubt on the other hand about the major thesis it is blazoned on the title page with its submalicious quotation from st paul to the romans  we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the necessary gloss on this text is given in chapter lxviii where ernest after his arrest is thus described  he had nothing more to lose money friends character all were gone for a very long time if not for ever but there was something else also that had taken its flight along with these i mean the fear of that which man could do unto him cantabit vacuus who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already  let him but be able to earn his bread and he knew of nothing which he dared not venture if it would make the world a happier place for those who were young and loveable herein he found so much comfort that he almost wished he had lost his reputation even more completelyfor he saw that it was like a mans life which may be found of them that lose it and lost of them that would find it he should not have had the courage to give up all for christss sake but now christ had mercifully taken all and lo t it seemed as though all were found as the days went slowly by he came to see that christianity and the denial of christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do it was a fight about namesnot about things practically the church of rome the church of england and the freethinker have the same ideal standard and meet in the gentleman  for he is the most perfect saint who is the most perfect gentleman with this help the text and the thesis can be translated  all experience does a gentleman good it is the kind of thing we should like very much to believe as an article of faith it was held with passion and vehemence by dostoevsky though the connotation of the word  gentleman  was for him very different from the connotation it had for butler butlers gentleman it should be said in passing was very much the ideal of a period and not at all quod semper quod ubique  a very victorian antivictorianism dostoevsky worked his thesis out with a ruthless devotion to realistic probability he emptied the cornucopia of misery upon his heroes and drove them to suicide one after another and then had the audacity to challenge the world to say that they were not better more human and more lovable for the disaster in which they were inevitably overwhelmed and though it is hard to say  yes  to his challenge it is harder still to say  no in the case of ernest pontifex however we do not care to respond to the challenge at all the experiment is faked and proves nothing it is mere humbug to declare that a man has been thrown into the waters of life to sink or swim when there is an anxious but coolheaded friend on the bank with a 70000 litebelt to throw after him the moment his head goes under that is neither danger nor experience even if ernest pontifex knew nothing of the future awaiting him as we are assured he did not it makes no difference we know he cannot sink  he is a lay figure with a pneumatic body whether he became a lay figure for butler also we cannot say  we can merely register the fact that the book breaks down after ernests misadventure with miss maitland a deplorably unsubstantial episode to be the crisis of a piece of writing so firm in texture and solid in values as the preceding chapters ernest as a man has an intense nonexistence after all as far as tjie positive side of  the way of all flesh  is concerned butlers eggs are all in one basket if the adult ernest does not materialize the book hangs in empty air whatever it may be instead it is not a great novel nor even a good one so much established we may begin to collect the good things christina is the best of them she is on any standard a remarkable creation butler was  all round  christina both by analysis and synthesis she is wholly his he can produce her in either way she lives as flesh and blood and has not a little of our affection  she is also constructed by definition if it were not too awful a thing to say of anybody she meant well the whole phrase gives exactly christinas stature alethea pontifex is really a bluff  but the blurt succeeds largely because having experience of christina we dare not call it mrs jupp is triumphantly complete there are even moments when she seems greater than mrs quickly the novels that contain three such women or two if we reckon the uncertain alethea who is really only a vehicle for butlers very best sayings as cancelled by the nonexistent ellen can be counted we suppose on our ten fingers of the men theobald is well worked out in both senses of the word but we know little of what went on inside him we can fill out christina with her inimitable daydreams  theobald remains something of a skeleton whereas we have no difficulty at all with dr skinner of roughborough we have a sense of him in retirement steadily filling the shelves with volumes of skinner and we know how it was done when he reappears we assume the continuity of his existence without demur the glimpse of george pontifex is also satisfying  after the christening party we know him for a solid reality pryer was halfcreated when his name was chosen butler did the rest in a single paragraph which contains a perfect delineation of  the oxford manner  twenty years before it had become a disease known to ordinary diagnosis the curious may find this towards the beginning of chapter li but ernest upon whom so much depends is a phantoma dream child waiting the incarnation which butler refused him foi twenty years was it laziness was it a felt incapacity  we do not know but in the case of a novelist it is our duty to believe the worst the particularity of our attitude to butler appears in the fact that we are disappointed not with him but with ernest we are even angry with that young man if it had not been for him we believe  the way of all flesh  might have appeared in 1882 it might have shortcircuited  robert elsmere j m m poetry ano time warton lecture on english poetry ix by sir henry newbolt for the british academy humphrey milford ls net the haunting thought of time and transience and the desire for immortality are the stuff of which much of the worlds poetry is made  how the days draw in   is the lament of the anacreons  but they will draw out again the platonists and the christians hopefully reply  draw out indeed to an interminable length there are some who love the earth so well that the only fault they have to find witl lite is its shortness to others this existence is a horrible exile from a fatherland that lies somewhere remote and radiant beyond the bounds of time sir henry newbolt regards the poet as being almost by definition an exile homesick for eternity after showing what has been the attitude of different poets towards the whole problem of time he ventures to suggest to the future poet a new way of envisaging this first and gravest of questions the poets of the future must follow sir henry newbolt and professor mctaggart in regarding time as an illusion  they will be optimistic and encouraging about the destinies ol the world because the future is to be  a progressive manifestation of the eternal now this is one way of disposing of time but there are others the poets of the future may quite as justifiably regard time not as an illusion but as the most fundamental of realities life moves and has its being in time  transience and death are the conditions of existence lt may be that the poets of the future will cease to bewail their exile from a problematic eternity and will rejoice in the incessant movement of a force which is for ever creating and destroying and building again but the poets of the future may safely be left to solve the problem for themselves meanwhile we have to thank sir henry newbolt for a most suggestive lecture on a theme which might with profit be developed at greater length  the way of all flesh by samuel butler a posthumous wrork by the author of  erewhon a note tells us that it was begun in 1872 and that the author was engaged upon it intermittently until 1884  it is therefore to a great extent contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be taken as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book though story deals with an english family which had risen from obscurity and extends over about twothirds of the nineteenth century lt is deliberate philosophical and thoroughly characteristic of its author richards 6s  the way of all flesh bv samuel butler 6s grant richards nobody who is acquainted with mfr samuel butlers former works would look to him for a novel written on popular lines and the wav of all flesh  is as little like the conventional novel of the moment as it was possible to make it it has no intricate plot almost no plot at all for that would have savoured too much of artifice and mr butler had set himself to reveal in these pages the life history of four generations of the pontifex family and did it with a fearless realism and a keen irony and simplicity of style that for purposes of comparison send one back to fielding and swift for its chief interest the book relies and safely relies on its characters who are drawn with remarkable skill and with a profound knowledge of humanity a few pages suffice for a vivid and complete presentment of old mr pontifex who is seventy odd at the beginning of the nineteenth century a quaint rugged village carpenter something of a painter and musician with a gift for organbuilding drawn in more detail is his son george who goes early to london into the business of an uncle and is byandbye partner in an important publishing firm the unfolding of his personality is a fine piece of work  even more so are the subtle developments of georges second son cutlhbert and later of cuthberts son ernest the women of the book are rendered with equal truth they are neither idealised nor distorted but presented simply unflinchingly in the colour of actual life and with all the frailties of humanity it is a novel that has indubitable elements of greatness it is full of a shrewd somewhat cynical philosophy and mellow worldly wisdom and grows upon the reader with an increasing interest because of its strong but unexaggerated human appeal  new novels the way of all flesh by samuel butler i grant richards this posthumous story may be unattractive to the ordinary novel  roader it opens casually it lacks form it has no sensational climax and no heroine it is not a rounded whole but the record of part of a life written as a brief introductory note by mr streatfeild tells us between 1872 and 1884 it exhibits a young mans trials from boyhood his experience in the church his collapse and subsequent rehabilitation in the world in order to explain his qualities his father and mother his grandfather and even his greatgrandfather are paraded before us the older generations with more leisure than an expert novelist would allow himself the heros father a clergyman and his mother are most trenchant portraits but have a belated air as they belong to the time before darwinism such selfdeceiving aggressive pietism as theirs is now we hope rare thus much said as to things which may deter the reader we advise him to persevere in his perusal for he will be well rewarded the book is a lesson to parents concerning the upbringing of their children which is as much needed as ever mr butler an original thinker goes with unerring frankness into the very heart of his subject he says boldly but sometimes too fiercely what many are thinking you may not take his views of life but you will learn something from examining them his irony is a useful dissolvent while his humour and admirably simple style are more effective than much heavy rhetoric good things abound here is happy observation concerning a style which is virtually unassailable yet to many offensive as well as monotonous i daresay she writes very well but she has fallen under the dominion of the words hope think  i feel  try  i bright and  little and can hardly write a page without introducing all these words and some of them more than once there are hints of autobiography too as in the following passagewith the public generally he is not a favourite he is admitted to have talent but it is considered generally to be of a queer un practical kind and no matter how serious he is he is always accused of being in jest his first book was a success for reasons which i have already explained but none of his others have been more than creditable failures he is one of those unfortunate men each one of whose books is sneered at by literary critics as soon as it comes out but becomes  excellent reading as soon as it has been followed by a later work which may in its turn be condemned the book is in fact a genuine piece of samuel butler and that means work of a rare kind by a unique man  fiction the way op all flesh by samuel butler grant richards this posthumous tale by the author of  erewhon  is not really the latest of his works a prefatory note by mr r a streatfield tells us that it was written between 1872 and 1884 and then laid aside with the intention that some day it should be rewritten it is extremely characteristic of mr samuel butlers individual temperament and outlook upon life whimsical and discursive in method racy in expression and full of satire which is often genial and occasionally to our taste at least a little acrid according to mr streatfield the work was largely contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be regarded as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book we regret that we do not recall what mr butlers precise theory of heredity is what the way of all flesh chiefly illustrates is the antagonism of the generations and its satire is mainly levelled at certain more or less unconscious views of parental responsibility which the author detects lurking beneath the moral pretensions of the british bourgeoisie they may be summed up as  willbreaking  at that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod was to spoil the child and st paul had placed disobedience to parents in very ugly company if his children did anything which mr pontifex disliked they were clearly disobedient to their father in that case there was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take it consisted in checking the first signs of selfwill while his children were still too young to offer serious resistance if their wills were  well broken in childhood to use an expression then much in vogue they would acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture to break through till they were over twentyone years old then they might please themselves  he should know how to protect himself till then he and his money were more at their mercy than he liked the narrative for mr butler is nothing if not biographical carries us through the history of several generations of pontifexes it is upon the head of the rev theobald pontifex who has the misfortune to be a priest as well as a parent that the vials of the authors scorn are most liberally poured and the story culminates in the career of the rev theobalds son ernest the will of ernest pontifex is broken in youth he grows up with an extreme ignorance of the world which lands him first in prison and subsequently in a most undesirable marriage finally he touches earth like antaeus in the bitterness of experience and rises up to be a man and hate his father a philosophical doctrine as to the formation of character by personal experience seems to be at the bottom of the book but it must be observed that ernest pontifex was much helped in the task of recovering his balance in life by the receipt of an unexpected legacy of 70000,social

the black sea and of a pilgrimage to jerusalem it differs markedly from most books of travel however in that the author is less concerned with the things seen along the line of route than with his own spiritual emotions and experiences as he himself says it is not so much a book about russia as about the tramp mr graham is among those who find salvation by going out into the wilderness he reminds one at times of thoreau there is the same impatience with the meaningless restraints of civilisation the same wild exuberant delight in the freedom of nature but whereas thoreaus withdrawal from the world had bred in him a certain scorn of humanity mr graham is overflowing with the milk of human kindness he finds friends everywhereamong the peasants of the russian steppes in eastern monasteries or turkish bazaars thoreau was alike by conviction and temperament a pagan the tone and temper of mr grahams book on the other hand are those of the christian so one is not surprised at the note of blitheness that runs through these pages often footsore the wanderer is never weary the world is full of unexpected delights there is the joy of the road the feeling of exhilaration that comes upon a man as he shoulders his knapsack and sets forth bravely into the unknown and there are quiet restingplaces at the journeys end sunrise and sunset the sound of the sea the music of birds darkness and the coming of dawnthese things become invested with a new meaning to the man who has gone out into the wilderness to find his soul he has time too to thinkand to pray and prayer mr graham would have us believe has an added effectiveness when offered amidst the silences of nature    prayers he writes are strong out of doors made in the presence of all the stars one is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there is calm all around and in ones own heart the mysterous beauty of the starry sky reflects itself in the soul and across its mirror sails the pale moon my own body becomes a

not is destined to endure  a tramps sketches by stephen graham 5s net m5acmillan the reader may consider mr grahams book in two lights either as a volume of remarkably interesting reminiscences of life on the open road or as a powerful appeal to the modern world to forsake the worship of the golden calf the authors tramp was along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and eventually to the heavenly city in the company of russian pilgrims his pen paints delicate little portraits of the simple and loveable russian peasant it describes too with striking vividness nights spent in strange cities and in lonely shacks i slept with the bare world as my house the sky as my roof and god as host he writes and lest an incautious reader should exclaim  how lovely we hasten to add that like the apostle paul mr graham was often in perils of waters in perils in the city and constantly in weariness and painfulness but the author expressly states that his book is more concerned with the tramp than with russia  it is the life of the wanderer and seeker the walking hermit the rebel against modern conditions and commercialism who has gone out into the wilderness commercialism he says is at present the great enemy of the individual man and the only hope for salvation is first of all for a few to live their lives out to the full in order that all others may live their lives completely mr graham seems conscious as he writes that he is a prophet crying in the wilderness and even if some of his readers may consider that he is imagining a vain thing they will be constrained to admit that the pursuit of this ideal has one great merit so far as mr graham is concernedthe delightful record of his vagabondage  a tramps sketches by stephen graham macmillan and co this is another volume by the author of undiscovered russia a charming tour of a tramp a real tramps life along the caucasian and crimean shores mr stephen graham admits frankly that he is a wanderer by predilection a rebel against modern conditions of commercialism which threaten not only to destroy art but the very perception for artistic creation it is a delightful book redolent of the open air of the night of the great silences of expanse and yet full of incident of aperfus into russian conditions and the minds of peasants revealing a real spiritual and material sympathy both with the black earth and the monks of monasteries whose hospitality he enjoyed and with his fellowcomrades of the road it is life that interests the author here we can get it and it is like splashing about in a clear pool on a warm summers day spontaneous in inspiration mature in philosophic contemplation this sort of book gives a man honest pleasure more it sets his heart beating in unison with the author in harmony with the

a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of

has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul

which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the

slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash

gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the

two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly

tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor

B5780,"['3169788', '6799254']",  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust that it has gone far enough to attract readers to a book which i am myself loth to lay down george cotterell,social

them to preach very useful sermons on some of the follies and vices of the day in this respect 4the eustace diamonds is particularly noteworthy we do not know whether we have a right ta claim mr trollope as in aay way a supporter of the movement for improving the condition af women but if he is an unintentional ally his service is all the more valuable aad he could not possibly render better service than by his drawing of such characters as those el his two unheroic heroines in this novel lissie eustace and lucy morris lizzie shows cleverness that with scope given for its honest exercise would have made her as useful as she is clever but being poor aad having no other trade than marriage open to her she becomes only a becky sharp squanders all her wits and leads a very foolish and mischievous life lucy is as sweet and simple as a daisy but daisylike she runs a chance of being trampled down altogether and all because conventional restraints have made her unfit to hold her own against the stronger will and more selfish fancy of her lover frank greystock frank greystock the yet more unheroic hero is as useful as are the two young ladies in showing what poor sorts of persons are i produced by the orthodox arrangements of society and the unfortunate inequality of the sexes that now prevails and is as injurious to men as it is to women but the novel also points to other and kindred morals i within the figure and frame and clothes and cuticle within the bones and flesh of many of us there is but one persona man or woman with a preponderance either of good or evil whose conduct in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman such persons are simple single and perhaps generally safe they walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles and are today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow as they are today lady eustace was such a person and so was lucy morris opposite in their characters as two poles they were each of them a simple entity  and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman but there are human beingswho though of necessity single in body are dual in character in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good but to whom evil is sometimes horribly hideously evil but is sometimes also not hideous at all of such men it may be said that satan obtains an intermittent grasp from which when it is released the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble such menor women may hardly perhaps debase themselves with the more vulgar vices they will not be rogues or thieves or drunkardsor perhaps liars but ambition luxury selfindulgence pride and covetousness will get a hold of them and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices such a man waa freak greystock who could walk along the banks of the quiet troutgiving bob at bobsboroogb whipping the river with his rod telling himself that the world lost for tove would be a had thing well lost for a fine purpose  and who could also stand with his hands in his trousers pockets looking down upon the pavement in the purlieus of the courts of westminster and swear to himself that he would win the game let the cost to his heart be what it might what must a man be who would allow some undefined feeling some inward ache which he ealls a passion aad cannot analyse some desire which has come of instinct aad not of judgmentto interfere with all the projects of his intellect with all the work which he has laid out for his accomplishment circumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which indeed his meanswere insufficient but which he regarded as of all paths the noblest and the manliest if he could be true to himselfwith such truth as at these moments would seem to him to bethe truest truththere was nothing in rank nothing in ambition which might not be within his reach he might live with the highest the besteducated and the most beautiful he might assist ia directing national councils by his intelligence and might make a name for himself which should be remembered in his country and of which men would read the records in the histories written in after ages but to do this he must walk warily he an embarrassed man a man already in debt a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion was called upon to live and to live as though at his ease among those who had been bora te wealth and indeed he had so cleverly learned the ways of the wealthy that he hardly knew any longer how to live at his ease among the poor but had he walked warily when he went down to richmond and afterwards sitting alone in the obscurity of his chamber wrote the letter which bad made lucy morris so happy  the loves and pains the joys and struggles of these three persons form the basis of the plot of mr trollope  novel a diamond necklace furnishing the very ingenious thread on which it is strung in the prelude we learn that lizzie a poor orphan with good looks and spoilt talentt for her only fortune had succeeded in marrying lord eustace a rich and sickly youth and in causing him to die of a broken heart before a year was out when the detailed story begins she is trying to catch another husband by help of the fortune that she now possesses aa estate in scotland worth 4000 a year for life besides this however sha claims as her own property some splendid diamonds worth 10000 which the family solicitor regards as an heirloom that ought to ba given up for the benefit of her infant son when he suooeeds to the estate aad out of her greedy holding of these diamonds until they are stolen from her grow nearly all her troubles they cause her match with lord fawn to be broken off and bringing her into close intimacy with her cousin frank make her very anxious to form a match with him frank nearly yields to her fascinations and to the charm of her fortune and is accordingly very neglectful during more than two volumes of lucy morris the governess whom he really loves though he shrinks from marrying any one who has not some of the money that he sorely needs to help him on in his scheme of ambition nothing could be much better in its way than mr trollopes working out of frank greybtocks character shown in his flirtations with lizzie eustace in his honest lovemaking with lucy and in all his other actions throughout the book like persons goodhearted and even generous yet vacillating and in the main very selfish mr trollope has already described in great numbers but he always excels in this kind of portraiture and frank grey stock is equal to the best of his sort of course frank has enough distinguishing characteristics to justify his appearance in  the eustace diamonds and as long as such persons exist in real life and when will they cease to exist they can hardly be laughed at too often especially with such kindly laughter as slr trollope knows exactly how to arouse many of the minor persons in  the eustace diamonds are as carefully drawn as the principals especially lord fawn the dilletante undersecretary of state who regrets his engagement with lizzie very soon after it has been made yet is at his wits end to find some means of breaking it off without scandal and mrs carbuncle a very lively representative of the adventurous ladies who  get on in society until they are found out but why should we say much about a novel that so many people have probably by this time read   the fitful fever of a life by sir f vincent 3 vols newby  fever is an inappropriate title for sir francis vincents novel he has collected an immense number of people of a marriageable age and given them for the most part nothing to do but dancing croquet riding and similar amusements with the addition of cigarsmoking for the male portion of his puppetshow of course they drift into love and matrimony with various success caroline curtis the leading lady having somewhat more character than her companions is rather wicked and very foolish the others being only rather foolish and not wicked at all for her a villain is provided in the shape of one hargrave aristocrat gambler and forger who after acting as philosopher and bearleader on the continent to a mr william bradford a young gentleman of eminent probity who shows no sort of objection or suspicion with regard to his companions character or the places and people he makes acquaintance with under his auspices repays his pupils kindness on his return to england by eloping with caroline when she is on the eve of marriage with his friend of course the erring couple are duly punished hargrave dying a felons death in prison and caroline after various hardships making an eminently satisfactory and saintly end the other pairs are more conventional and more happy in their loves for some time an obstacle in the shape of poverty hinders the felicity of mary bradford and the partner of her choice but that difficulty being surmounted by the bold expedient of a fortune being left to mr eden they attain the same successful consummation of their hopes as the halfdozen other couples who drag through three volumes the even tenor of their way with the exception of too copious a use of scraps of french and some eccentricities on the part of the printer there is positively nothing to object to in the  fitful fever of a life it is not at all feverish and perhaps a trifle hard to read but this last point may be useful as a mental discipline for those who have ample leisure to employ on novel reading,social
B2108,['8526331'],  the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,social

B7085,['8304846'],  traditions of lancashire second series by j roby mral 2 vols 8vo rich indeed in legendary lore is the county of lancashire and well for her traditions is it that they have fallen into such able hands as those of mr roby to a thorough knowledge of antiquarian learning he unites a brilliant imagination and is thus enabled to throw over the pile of hoar antiquity the light which renders the ruin so beautiful and attractive with the wand of the magician he stays the rapidly departing shadows  more than this he imparts a new substance and reality to them and gives relief and prominence to things but dimly seen  he rescues  the relics of the past from the oblivion to which they were hastening and by a rare union of the antique and the modern he illustrates manners and customs now obsolete by tales that however bearing upon tradition have still a distinct and separate interest to recommend them if his imagination is tempted to overstep her limits the severity of the antiquary restrains her flight and thus the keeping is perfect the style of the work is another of its excellencieswhether of humour or of pathoswhether of love or terrorwhether in the whirlwind of passion or in ladys bower in the conflict of the elements or in the placid lakenature in her summer beauty or the howling of the winters stormmr roby has appropriate language for each and all nor is it the least of his merits that in every tale there is a fine moral tone and a moral purpose while the impress of a pious mind is visibly stamped upon the whole it is true that we are constantly reminded of sir walter scott and this has been supposed to detract from the originality of mr robys work we do not think so for it is not in parallel passages or in characters for which we could find a prototype in the author of waverley  but we find ourselves perpetually saying  this is in scotts manner meaning that if scott had chosen the subject he would thus have treated it and this we consider as very high praise having thus briefly offered our opinion of the general merits of mr robys volumes we proceed to give extacts which will justify our praise premising that in tales none of which are of any length it is difficult to discover passages which can afford a fair specimen of mr robys manner the following describes the person of that young pretender to the crown of england in the reign of henry the seventh by some historians said to be lambert simnel and by others the unfortunate earl of warwick it was at the peel or castle of fouldrey that his mimic and motley court was first held before a long narrow table near the bed and on a highbacked oaken chair sat the young pretender he was dressed in a richly embroidered gown the sleeves wide and hanging down from the wrists like lappets on his head was a low cap surmounted by long waving feathers and his manners and appearance were not devoid of grace and gentility he displayed considerable selfpossession and wore his kingly honours with great assurance he was of a fair and sanguine complexion pale rather than clear and his hair clustered in heavy ringlets on his shoulders a rapid and somewhat uncertain motion of the eye and his mouth not weil closed showed that although he might have been schooled to the exhibition and could wear the outward show of firmness and decision yet in the hour of emergency and in the day of trial his fortitude would in all likelihood forsake him then we have portraits of his followers  at his right hand eat the priest in a white cassock and scapulary a black hood thrown back upon his shoulders exhibited the form and dismsition of his head to great advantage his features were large expressive and commanding the fire of a brilliant grey eye was scarcely tempered by his overhanging brows though at times the spirit seemed to retire behind their grim shadows to survey more securely and unobservedly the aspect and appearances without  swartz the flemish general a blunt military chieftain was at his side a black bushy beard some inches in advance of his honest goodhumoured face was placed in strong contrast with the wary pale and somewhat dubious aspect of the priest  kildare the irish deputy and lovel with several of the senior officers and captains were assembled round the table  the room was lofty lighted by a small pointed window and contained the luxury of a fireplace in which lay some blazing embers  a grateful and refreshing sight in that chill and ungenial atmosphere by the artifices of margaret duchess of burgundy a mysterious personage of gigantic stature appears and directs the councils of the rebels and is by them supposed to be supernatural this fact comes to the knowledge of the abbot of furness a loyal adherent of henryby dispatches intercepted by a halfwitted fellow dick empson and an attempt is made to turn this information to account and to induce tiie rebels to quit the castle of mr robys talent for the ludicrous not unmixed with the terrible we could not mention a better specimen than the tale entitled  the dule upo dun but we must refer our readers to the volumes where they will find much that is curious and all entertaining we will not repeat our praise of the work  we hope soon to find mr roby employed with equal talent on the traditions of other counties assured that so diligent a reaper will gather an abundant harvest wherever he shall put in his sickle his defence of tradition against the charges of the historian in the introduction to this series is a learned and clever dissertation,social

B2597,"['8592699', '6672445']",  litetature daniel deronda daniel deronda by george eliot london w blackwood and sons we know not which to admire most in  daniel deronda the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as gwendolen and daniel deronda or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at derondas wedding feast  the entire cohen family with the one exception of though baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home in none of george eliots novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present one cannot lay down though last volume of  daniel deronda without some tribute of astonishment at though vast range of the authors powers it is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of english societya great work of course in either view on the whole perhaps ones impression is that in  daniel deronda george eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place and a novelist in the second the purely pictorial purpose in this as in others of her novels is subordinate to the ethical in  daniel deronda strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist the dominant motive as revealed in the last volume of the work is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time in its last pages instead of an invitation to esthetic or humorous reverie we seem to find a trumpetcall to young men and maidensto young men to take example by the noble gravity of daniel deronda and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of gwendolen harleth and its tragic consequences a protest against low sordid personal aims an incentive to a higher worthier more aspiring and humane life such would seem to be the ruling intention of daniel deronda wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are which may satisfy though flaunting gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities the earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of though elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes and the full earnestness of the authors purpose was not certain till the very last and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind this says much for though success with which george eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should as a whole point somewhere teach some lesson have some aspiration towards the infinite all through the skilful dissection of gwendolens heartlessness which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon we feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology by a most skilful professor of the social microscope this creature a product of the generation is dissected before us and put piece by piece under the glass wo look on peep in our turn through the instrument and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure professor eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments but having completed her pathological lecture she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature an undeveloped organ  note this i will return to it another time in though course of though exposition we have become deeply interested in this organ and byandby our curiosity is gratified we aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system it seems as if george eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of casaubon and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of gwendolen and mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and lightheaded conceit and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm there must be hundreds of girls more or less like gwendolen among george eliots readers and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies perhaps if george eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint she ought to have increased gwendolens punishment for after all gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles being left with two thousand ayear and a developed conscience and free to marry if she chooses a hearty handsome young cousin whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days but then gwendolens crime after all was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened and her wicked husband is drowned if grandcourt had turned np again or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning but it would have been too miserable besides that if sho had been left in physical misery we could not have had though same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration if gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period daniel deronda is equally an example to the young man of though period in the gravity and loftiness of his aims our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig and would jeer at his relations with gwendolen as impossible  and their judgement of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race his grave meditative nature his profound composure and selfcontrol his steady persistent passion are eminently hebraic and are meant to be so he is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin it is an influence too to which in our earnest moments we are not incapable of yielding ourselves and with the healthiest of results there is a something in it also which is repellent to the average common sense of englishmen that something is well expressed by sir hugo mullinger an admirably drawn type of the cultivated english squire i have long expected something remarkable from you dan  but for gods sake dont go into any eccentricities i can tolerate any mans difference of opinion hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic at this stago of though world if a man wants to be tikn seriously ho must keep clear of melodrama dont misunderstand mo i am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account i only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic especially if he wanted defending you have a passion for people who arc pelted dan im sorry for them too but so far as company goes its a kid ground of selection still sir hugo does not quarrel with daniel deronda for his innacy ho respects his earnestness and here again he is typical of his countrymen by far the most wonderful part of  daniel deronda its chief claim to admiration as an achievement is its picture of the jews its exemplification and analysis of different forms of jewish life some of them not so estimable as deronda and mordecai we have spoken of the cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work in the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of lapidoth mirahs father who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some musiclessons ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat  thc look of impudent suavity the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the hebrew race the interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond who has something of the character of charles mathewss awful dad and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated is very finely conceived there are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making lapidoths impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his sons stern rebuke  or who having done so would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek the humour of lapidoths subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to mordecai and deronda and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry is exquisite george eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly among the minor characters in  daniel deronda  there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is lapidoth when we think of all that there is in daniel deronda we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist still wthen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art we must admit that it has deficiencies it is a subepidermic subcutaneous kind of art the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology it is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness and that dullness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment the novel is not a work of art pure and simple but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts there is a want of courage in george eliot she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves she must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing what principles of their nature they are illustrating she is too professorial too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him nevertheless she is a great writer a great genius and if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum total  literature daniel deronda by george eliot edin burgh and london w blackwood  sons 187g independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections daniel deronda is eminently interesting because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light though merits as well as the faults of its writer merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated and are not as is too frequently the case blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of english letters on the one hand we are prepared to find and we do find an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character  a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade attitudes transient moods of mind complex feelings and the like which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer  an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims and a wonderful sympathy with humanity so far at least as it is congenial to the writer on the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and onesided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent to this black list must be added some decided faults in style in discussing a book which is in everybodys hands it will be well to show how the above points are brought out and how they affect the general merit of the book rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot in the matter of character then wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture the part of gwendolen harleth is throughout an overwhelming success and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch her selfwilled youth the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character which her selfconfidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her her instant surrender at though touch of material discomfort  the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit the helpless outbursts of selfpity of rage of supplication which follow that collapse  the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience  the torrent of remorse and final prostration of willare all imagined with a firmness and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence which cannot but command admiration the husband is almost equally admirable  indeed ones admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly and that the author would like ns to detest grandcourt yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait as he appears before us acting with strict politeness to his wife in no way violent towards ber if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language and employing for the purposes of his refined tyranny nothing stronger than the methods of  awful rule and right supremacy if he should appear to anyone all the more detestable it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival the more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them and an additional interest is impaitcd by the discovery that gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of dorothea animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy it might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that though soul of casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as grandcourt but these nro fancies the point of present importance is that though interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so of the third according to though authors design the first personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken the blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coatcollar continually who at the age of some twenty years wished  to get rid of a merely english attitude in studies  who in the words of his best friend was disposed  to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium   of whom it was impossible to believe in the still more graphic words of the friends sister  that he had a tailors bill and used boothooks who never does a wicked thing and never says one that is not priggishis a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike but refuse to admit him as possible only once perhaps is he humanwhen he persuades himself on all sorts of ethicophysicohistorical grounds that he should like to be a jew solely becauso as that very sensible woman his mother the princess discovers at once he wishes to marry a fascinating jewess we cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this  faultless monster  as hero though pleas put forward in the book that it is only though  average man  and the  dull man  that will not understand him and that the average man is not very clear about though structure of his own retina and the dull mans  dullness subsists notwithstanding his lack of belief in it in the first place the cases are not parallel for though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough and in the second place though dull man may fairly retort  if you are a great novelist make me believe in your characters in this dearth or rather distortion of central interest the minor characters do not help us much they are far less individual and far less elaborate than is usual with george eliot daniel deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of mdmes holt and cadwalladcr poy ser and glegg sir hugo mullinger with hans meyrick and his sister mab makes a shift to fill up the gap but it is but a shift lapidoth the unwelcome father is chiefly welcome to us the readers because ol the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers mordecai we must not we suppose call a minor character but of him more hereafter there is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which george eliot has accustomed us though account of gwendolens grounds of confidence  the charming etching of though wagon passing pennieote keeto ry the scene of thc first ride with grandcourt gwendolen nfl cr klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover the wonderful sketch of grandcourt sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature deronda in the synagogue the stables at the abbey  thc waiting at genoa for the princess  and lastly gwendolens retrospect of ofleiulonc are all effects ofthe finest in this kind but this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed as it seems t o us in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in themselves and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged might have freer play no one can read daniel de rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that though author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed we cannot away in a novel with emotive memory and dynamic quality with  hymning of cancerous vices  and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss with  coercive types  and  spiritual perpetuation still less with hundreds ol phrases less notable because bulkier xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough and they are all more or less intelligible to decentlyeducated people no doubt though truths of science mental and physical are here as elsewhere in our authors works rendered with astonishing correctness and facility but it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate in philosophy in politics in religion in art a novelist when he speaks in his own person should have no opinion should be of no sect should indulge in no argot if we are dissatisfied with though jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition we do not in the slightest degree feel  imperfect sympathy with jews and we hold that shylock had the best of the argument but the question here is whether the phase of judaism now exhibited the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle we think that it has not and we are not to be converted by references to the average man the average man has never experienced the passion of hamlet of othello or of lear he is not capable of the chivalry of esmond of the devotion of des grieux of the charity of the vicar of wakefield but he has experienced and he is capable of something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms now the  samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine to borrow a phrase from allon locke into which mordecai initiates deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human they aro not only  willworship but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling poetry could legitimately treat them indeed many of mordecais traits may be recognised as we think moro happily placedin though sephardo of the spanish gypsy they are no doubt interesting historically they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph but for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest of prose novels should be wrought it is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with though manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of mordecai probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic if though thing was to be done it could hardly have been done better assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive we should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion which characterise the subjects and situations of the authors earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present it is a timehonoured transition and one which has before now yielded excellent results but in reality the transition is not in this case great because the subjectmatter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment the book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of george eliots work which lurks even in the scenes of clerical life which is hardly in abeyance in adam bede which is though professed motive of the mill on the floss of the spanish gypsy and of romola which gives charm to the slightness of silas mar uer  to wit the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty hither than the op posing instinct all for love and the world well lost perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application but this is matter of opinion the matter of fact remains that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between gwendolens misery and the prosperity of the sleek deronda the same moral as we had in hettys catastrophe in the fate which punished maggie tullivers partial declension from the standard in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from duke silvas passion in the degradation and death of tito melema though same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of felix holt for a hero and of dorothea brook for a heroine the moral and the standard and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity and deal deserved rebuke to though lax pleasureseeking which has been considered a vice at all times and is not openly considered a virtue even yet in though illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits and much exquisitelydrawn surrounding but perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the immutable law that no perfect novel can ever be written in designed illustration of a theory whether moral or immoral and that art like atticus and the turk will bear no rival near the throne george

and co thoroughly genuine and unaffected these memoirs display the whole mind of a woman who was well worth knowing and relate a large part of her experience among people with whose names and characters the world will be at all times busy a true woman and a keen observer indoctrinated in all the prepossessions of the old nobility yet superior to most of its prejudices in the secret comers of her heart a little superstitious not at all exempt from little vanities and weaknesses that rather grace her sex firmly affectionate in nature and by position thrown in the high places of the world the countess doberkirchlanele as her bosom friends tenderly called herwas the very woman to write memoirs that would interest future generations we commend the volumes before us most heartily to every reader they were written by the baroness in the bloom of her own life and health and though they narrate many experiences of life in a corrupt court everything comes to us on her pages through a mind so pure and true that we are never shocked while at the same time the whole narration is so fresh a transcript of what seemed most interesting in the writers own experience that we are never wearied that is to say of course if we skip all the pedigrees the baroness esteems birth very highly  and when she speaks of any one for the first time if he should happen to have a father and a grandfather she thinks it due to state the fact and mention who they are all this however adds to the character and charm of the whole book the baroness does not mystify herself her weak sides are patent enough but they are pleasant little weaknesses belonging to her period and to the station that she held in her first chapter she frankly says i may perhaps have lingered a little too long over these accounts of my family but i do not regret it in the first place i wished it to be distinctly known from what race i have sprung i feel it to be a conscientious obligation and besides i find a pleasure in relating these particulars i have the weakness if it be one to esteem what the heroes of the present day call trifles and i ask in my future soninlaw if providence should tend me one in the midst of the chaos which surrounds us and which seems about to swallow up ali social order i ask i tay in my soninlaw only high birth there it a remedy for every defect but the want of that at the same time

more children i was so surprised that i looked round rae not supposing it possible that he could have the audacity to address a lady of my rana in such a place and such a presence i thought he was sneaking td somebody else and did not answer  reply madam said the cardinal with a supplicating air u my lord madame doberkirch speaks upon such subjects only with those with whom she has the honour

man arni that nothing but the fear of annoying m doberkirch whose aversion for all these mummeries i knew well could prevent me the cardinal stared openmouthed he was evidently under the control of this skilful juggler as he has since too well proved that day will remain for ever engraven on my memory it was with difficulty that i tore myself from a fascnation which 1 cannot yet comprehend but whose influence i could not deny 1 have not yet finished with cagliostro and what i am about to relate is at least as extraordinary and more generally known than what 1 have narrated he predicted the death of the empress maria theresa and even foretold the hour at which she should expire m de rohan told it to me in the evening aud it was five days after that the news arrived in looking over these pages for a few selections that will illustrate our good opinion we are bewildered among riches they are a perfect magazine of pleasant anecdotes and interesting characteristic things the baroness in her youth became a house friend in the little court of montbeliard from which proceeded the wife of the unfortunate grand duke paul the heirapparent to the throne of russia the future grand duchess was the bosom friend of the baroness and the more than sisterly affection was retained by them both until the last paul and his warmhearted beautiful wife travelled from russia under the names of count and countess du nord and remained some time in paris whither the baroness doberkirch was taken by her husband that she might rejoin her friend life in alsatia at strasburg and montbeliard is therefore succeeded by a chronicle of life among the court circles the poets and philosophers the balls and theatres of paris in 1762 afterwards there is a further account of residence in paris during

interapsmd  with pedigrees that will be found extremely edifying we will omit however as we have not space for them the verses of the poet in honour of the occasion a marriage took place in that october of thit year which was considered a legitimate subject of conversation for everybody the prince of nassau saarbruk married his son who waa only twelve to mademoiselle de montbarrey who waa eighteen years of age bverybedy was astonished at this alliance not because he waa protestant and she catholic for mixed marriages were very common in that country but because of the age of the prince the young princess wat to return to her parents immediately after tnt ceremony and to remain with them until her husband should be of age mademoiselle de montbarrey ia daughter to the ancient warminister tnt count de st germain had appointed him his assistant in this office in which he succeeded him as he was very clever he profited largely by hie position he was created prince of the holy roman empire grandee of spain knight of the order and grand baillie of haguenau hie wife had been n great beauty she had a most exquisite complexion pearly teeth a captivating smile soft dovelike eyes and caressing mannerall of which made her one of the most charruing persona in the world she haa been accused of having had a too tender heart but she waa beloved and has enjoyed with taste and grace the position of her husband this marriage of the prince de nanausaarbruk with mademoiselle de montbarrey waa a very grand affair the comte de saarbruk as well as that of saarwerden was ceded to france with a number of j dependent lands and lordships in 1681 by an article of the trenry of westphalia to indemnify the ouiit de naeaausaarbruk the emperor by letters patent raised him 4th of august 1688 to the rank of prince of the holy roman bmpire the bridal pair received congratulations and compliments in every possible form i have preserved a copy of some verses addretsed to the princes by a drawingroom poet and which were read with great j avidity during the bridal festivities these verses are very stupid  but i quote them because tbty amused us exceedingly when we considered that this husband  possessor of your charms and who  to loves enchanting bliss shall wake was a child of twelve years of age who wept from morning to night frantic at being made an object of universal curiosity flying from his wife and even repulsing her with the rudeness of aa illbred child and having no desire to claim a title whose signification he did not understand mademoiselle de montbarrey belied ber ordinary good taste in making a display of these verses it would have been better to conceal them m de dietrich who had purchased in 1761 the seigniory of reis boffen near haynenau had the castle rebuilt in 69 thia was confiscated property of the prince de vauderaont and bore the name of an ancient family of alsace now extinct the reigning prince of nassau saarbruk gave brilliant fetes in this castle upon the event of tke marriage of his son with the princess maximiliana de montbarrey all the province was invited thereall the neighbouring courts everything was on a scale of the greatest magnificence the hunts feasts and promenades lasted three daya m doberkirch and i were present i met several persons of ray acquaintance both french and i german during the ball the bridegroom would on no account consent to dance with the bride he was at length threatened with a whipping in case of further refusal and promised a deluge of sugarplums and all sorts of sweetmeats if he complied  whereupon he consented to lead her through a minuet though ht showed so great an aversion to her who had a legal claim upon his attentions he manifested a great sympathy for little louisa de dietrich a child of his own age and returned to ait beside her aa soon as he could free himself from the ennutjeuse ceremony of attending on hie bride thit was the  husband wh southeast  rapt embrace  awaited the young princess i could not describe how much we laoghed at thett exaggerations and at the demeanour of the little bridegroom my brother undertook to console him nnd was showing kim some prints in

imeeting once more her beloved grandduchess who was then making the tour of europe also in the company of her husband this portion of the work is very interesting for the baroness gives us a much more lifelike sketch than we possessed before of the haut monde at the period immediately prior to the revolution the reception accorded by the court of versailles to the successors of the czarina was as might naturally be expected very splendid indeed  and madame doberkirclr as the intimate friend of the grandduchess was not excluded from a full participation in them the severe laws of etiquette were even abated somewhat in her favour for the royal family dispensing in her case with the tedious formula of presentation admitted her at once to the freedom granted to distinguished foreigners the grandduke and duchess made their european tour under the title of the count and countess du nord and a few words of explanation as to the cause of this will not be misplaced as giving some idea of the extraordinary rigidity of french etiquette which since the days of louis xiv had become so severe and unbending that the court refused to recognise at all the rank of foreign princes before the imperial majesty of france all ranks though never so illustrious mingled indiscriminately with the common herd and when it so happened that visitors of royal rank were favoured with an invitation to dine they could not be allowed the honour of touching hands on this account it became the custom of such foreign magnates as desired a closer inspection of the glories of versailles to appear there under fictitious names by making which sacrifice to the dignity of the french throne the laws of etiquette were somewhat relaxed in their favour and they were admitted as a matter of grace to familiarities which under their proper titles they would not have been permitted to claim as a matter of right immediately on her arrival in paris the baroness lost no time in paying her respects to madame bertin the famous court milliner of the day of this ladys inflated ideas of her own importance many amusing anecdotes are related on one occasion a provincial lady of some importance applied to her for a headdress when the milliner having eyed her from head to foot and appearing satisfied with the result of her examination turned with a majestic air to one of her assistants saying  show this lady the result of my last conference with her majesty the impressions produced upon the mind of the baroness by the splendours of versailles appear to have been of the most lively description she attended the reception of her friend the countess du non and was present at an entertainment subsequently given in honour of the illustrious guests after dinner the entire court assembled in the saloon de la paix where there was to be a concert there were places in the gallery for persons who had been presented but had not received invitations from the queen the palace was all brilliantly illuminated as on days of high ceremonial a thousand chandeliers depended from the ceilings and every bracket supported a branch holding forty waxlights the effect was magical it would be impossible to give an adequate description of the splendour and richness of the decorations of the magnificence of the dresses or of the matchless beauty of the queen who lent a grace and charm to everything around her  one of the most striking coup deils that i have ever seen is that oif the royal family at a ball when all the court is assembled there is a gracious majesty in the bearing of the queen particularly in her airs de ttme which is peculiar to herself the kindness and affability of the king are extreme their majesties are followed by madame elizabeth and all the princes and princesses all attended by their respective suites the effect is magical as well by the quantity and splendour of the jewels as by the gold and silver embroideries and the richness of the stuff those who have not seen this tabeau ricant can form no idea of it alas alas but a short period of years and these airs de the what were they before the pitiless undiscriminating edge of the guillotine the literati of paris were of course not at all backward in paying their court to the heir to the empire of the czars and foremost among them came m de la harpe of whom the baroness does not appear to have entertained the most favourable opinion his excessive and ridiculous selflove says she was unbearable no amount of compliments could satisfy him he was become a burden to us all an anecdote she relates of him is very happy indeed one day soon after the appearance and damnation of his tragedy the barmecide he happened to be walking near the carriage in which were seated the baroness and two other ladies of faishion when a man passed by crying  who will btuy my walkingsticks a la barmicide walkingsticks  la barmcide said one of the ladies  that ought to interest you m de la iiarpe allow rue to present you with one of these canes in remembrance of your great success the man was accordingly summoned to approach the carriage and presented three or four canes with very ugly ivory balls on the tops why do you call the in a la barmecide  said the lady  you shall see madame said the man with a very knowing air and taking off one of the ivory balls he showed that it concealed an immense ratcall the ladies had the cruelty to burst into laughter and as for poor de la iiarpe le could as beaumarchais said have shed tears of bile in spite of the previous declaration of her willingness to play the part of a mecena8 her aristocratic predelictions caused the baroness to hold the school of free philosophers then springing up in the greatest horror and detestation she speaks of them constantly in almost a prophetic spirit as  those gentlemen who have caused and will yet cause us so much evil rousseau she appears to have held in especial horror that she should visit the sins of the times upon the poor philosophers and spare her favourite nobility is somewhat as if one were to pardon those who wilfully set fire to a city and punish only those who raise the alarm her strong gorx sense does not appear to have saved her from a tendency to superstition to which indeed she confesses a natural predisposition several clairroyant stories and a ghost story imposed upon her credulity by the grandduke of russia in which the ghost of peter the great is summoned from the world of spirits would have been better bestowed in a collection of marvellous tales than in a work assuming the credit of authenticity in may 1784 m doberkirch visited paris for the second time and underwent the ceremony of being formally presented to her sovereign the strictness with which the examination into the respectability of applicants for this distinetion was conducted may be inferred from the fact that the testimonials of noble descent were required to date from the year 1399 and even then loutis xvi reserved to himself the power of accepting or refusing the testimonials and of deciding in all doubtful cases the officer upon whom the duty of verifying the testimonials of descent devolved was ciierin surnamed on account of his flexibility in this respect the incorriptibh it was in reference to this dignitary that chamfort said when nature wishes to make a virtuous man or a man of genius she does not go to cherin the baroness however passed happily through the ordeal and she complacently indulges us with an enumeration of the various advantages consequent upon the honour titled ladies such as duchesses the wives of spanish grandees and those whose families possessed the hereditary honours of the louvre took on their presentation the privilege of the tabouret which was an imperial of crimson velvet bound with gold to be worn on their carriages and they might have a dais erected in their drawingrooms the king also had to kiss them when they were presented to him but this is said to have been a ceremony very disagreeable to louis xvi his two predecessors possibly did not find it so during this visit to paris as one day she was walking in the palais royal with her husband mie doberkirch happened to tread upon the toe of the celebrated dancer vestris the rebuke of the great man was characteristic  madame said he  you have escaped putting all paris into mourning for a fortnight this dieu de danse used to say that in his day there were three great men in europe himself the king of prussia and m de voltaire some anecdotes of lady craven and her connexion with the margrave of anspach will not be without interest to those who study the annals of our aristocracy and a transcript of the confessions of the celebrated duchess of kingstoir supplied to the baroness by the duchess herself will be read with very great interest when the bastille fell the baroness donenkircii set a period to her story for worlds she writesfor worlds i would not

described as undergoing any painful amount of vicissitude but they pass along through shows files journeys and state receptions  chatting about fashions dresses singers and dancers and every now and

is so visibly the communication of a vicious education to a mind of the very commonest class to the apprehension of those by whom she was surrounded  order implied merely the ascendancy of their own order madame doberkirchs dwarf mind could not look over the low artificial barriers which were set up from childhood around it and which the coming tempest was to sweep away from her youth she wore aristocratic blinkers and nothing in her mind ever suggested their throwing off early in her volumes she formulates her own moral blindness and judicial littleness i have the weakness if it be one to

strasburg brought madame doberkirch into momentary relations with one more famous than the cardinal a very interesting conversation then commenced in which i took a real pleasure the cardinal being both wellinformed and wellbred when we were suddenly interrupted by a gentleman usher who opening the foldingdoors announced  his eminence the count de cagliostro   he was not strictly speaking handsome but never have i seen a more remarkable countenance his glance was so penetrating that one would be almost tempted to call it supernatural i could not describe the expression of his eyesit was so to say a mixture of flame and ice he attracted and repulsed and whilst he terrified inspired an insurmountable curiosity two portraits have been painted of him both very good likenesses and yet each widely different from the other he wore attached to his watch chain and upon his fingers diamonds which if they were what they appeared would be worth a king ransom he pretended that they were his own manufacture all this frippery revealed unmistakably the charlatan scarcely had the cardinal perceived than he ran to meet him and whilst he saluted him at the door said something which i did not try to overhear both approached us i had risen at the same time as the bishop but immediately resumed my place not wishing to allow this adventurer to believe that i would accord him any attention i was however soon forced to think of him  and i acknowledge now in all humility that i had no cause to repent having always had a passion for the marvellous his eminence contrived at the end of about five minutes not without some opposition on my part as well as on that of m doberkirch to make the conversation general he had the tact not to name mehad he done so i should have instantly risen but he contrived to manage the conversation so that hsprotig sometimes addressed us and politeness obliged us to reply cagliostro all this time continued to stare at me my husband made me a sign to come away but i felt the glance of these deep mysterious eyes enter my bosom like a gimlet i can find no better comparison to express the effect they produced upon me he suddenly interrupted m de rohan who par parcntlttee was overwhelmed with joy and said to me abruptlymadam your mother no longer lives you have scarcely known her and you have one daughter you are the only daughter of your family and you will have no more children i was so surprised that i looked round me not supposing it possible that he could have the audacity to address a lady of my rank in such a place and such a presence i thought he was speaking to somebody else and did not answer  reply madam said the cardinal with a supplicating air my lord madame doberkirch speaks upon such subjects only with thoee with whom she has the honour of being acquainted replied my husband in a tone that was almost impertinent i feared that he might forget the respect due to the bishop he rose and made a haughty salute i did the same the cardinal accustomed to find flatterers in all who approached him was embarrassed he did not know what to do however he drew near to m doberkirch cagliostro staring at me and addressed him in words so soothing that it was impossible to resist their influence  m de cagliostro is a learned man we must not treat him as an ordinary person added he  remain a few moments my dear baron allow madame doberkirch to reply there is neither sin nor impropriety i assure you and even if there were have i not the power of absolving in reserved cases  i have not the honour of being of your flock my lord interrupted m doberkirch with some slight remains of illhumour i know that but too well sir and am sorry for it you would do honour to our church baroness tell us whether m de cagliostro has been mistakentell us i pray you he has not been mistaken as to what concerns the past i replied not being able to refuse to bear testimony to the truth and i nm as little mistaken in what concerns the future said cagliostro in a tone so metallic that it echoed like the sound produced by a trumpet veiled with crape here are a few paris fashions for 1784  after the opera we went to the tuileries then the fashionable promenade but as the parisians do everything through caprice they selected one alley and would not take a step in any of the others all were suffocating some persons almost fought the buttons of the gentlemens coats carried off thc lace trimming of the ladies mantelets falbalas were torn by the pommels of swords and flounces of point lace were sometimes seen dangling from the end of a scabbard gentlemen began about this time to go about unarmed and wore swords only in full dress the humbler classes imitated them and fashion was more powerful than authority could have been   it is now the fashion to dine at three oclock and the time for dinner is very short of which the gastronomists and cooks complain sorely it seems as though the folk nowadays eat only for the sake of nutriment and wish when they have satisfied their appetites to fly from table the old people say that such conduct is not dignified the cooks are in open rebellion  people swallow said the cook of the duchess de la valliere they no longer taste i am dishonoured    ten is the hour for supper and the rapidity of execution at this meal is not less than at dinner the repast is not now announced to the lady of the house when dinner is ready the butler appears and the lady rises the age of gourmandise is past but our tables are not less elegantly laid the luxury ofthe i present day is alarming the men have scarcely j time to eat and drink  some of them have essayed j to be very engaging very gay even gallant hoping  to detain the ladies longer endeavouring possibly by these means to secure themselves a little time for j digestion i know one gentleman who commenced j a very interesting story after the first course interrupting himself every momentbreaking off his narrative by questions replies jeux de mots and various other artifices hoping thus to make it last a considerable time he succeeded in prolonging his history and keeping the attention of his auditors awake until after the fruit appeared and his appetite had been fully satisfied he practised this manoeuvre every evening and always succeeded   this blessed 6th of june she awakened me at the earliest dawn  i was to get my hair dressed and j make a grand toilette in order to go to versailles whither the queen had invited the countess du nord for whose amusement a comedy was to be performed these court toilettes are neverending and this road from paris to versailles very fatiguing especially when one is in continual fear of rumpling her petticoat and flounces i tried that day for the first time a new fashionone too which was not a little gtnante i wore in my hair little flat bottles shaped to the curvature of the head into these a little water was poured for the purpose of preserving the freshness of the natural flowers worn in the hair and of which the stems were immersed in the liquid this did not always succeed but when it did the effect was charming nothing could be more lovely than the floral wreath crowning the snowy pyramid of powdered hair and here are one or two fashionable personages of the time u i had been invited to a morning concert at the count dalbarets he is a rich piedmontese who has musicians in his own pay who live in his house and do not go out without his permission isle is passionately fond of music he has a large hall for the use of musicians where they practice all day for this reason his concerts are admirable  they are reputed the best iu paris that is easily understood a perfect harmony must exist between musicians who always practice together m dalbaret possesses a great deal of talent and writes very pretty verse he is a virtuoso in all the arts he is the intimate friend of madame de la massais and of madame de la rcyniere   m dalbaret often took a part in theatrical pieces with mesdames de montesson and de genlis he was the friend of both which was strange considering the cordial hatred they entertained for one another when i say he was their friend i mean that he was an acquaintance of both hut he did not like them  and i have heard that he gave very striking descriptions of each and not at all flattering madame de montesson had the airs of an upstart commoner and they seemed as natural to her as her mothers milk she sweated pride1 said la har pe and he ought to be a judge of the sentiment her life was a continued scene of domestic acting of which the object was to seduce that poor duke of orleans she got up scenes of which the parts had been rehearsed beforehand but he did not see through the artifice  she revels on beds of roses and in ermined robes with slipshod heels and cotton stocking said one day the duchess of bourbon to whom the mention of her stepmother caused a nausea it was she who most strongly resisted the idea of draping her carriage on the death of the first prince of the blood she went to thc king and boldly revealed to him what thc duke de chartres would have concealed the king ordered that the duchess of orleans inpartibus alas said the duchess of bourbon  we can no longer acid infidelium as she is well marriedthat madame de montesson in short should enter into the convent ofthe assumption where in its strict enclosure she may assume her queenly airs for her own private amusement i am anticipating events but all this escaped my pen as it ran rapidly through my thoughts the vanity of madame de genlis  the tutor showed itelf in a different fashion i do not wish to enter into particulars i did not like her spite of her accomplishments and the charm of her conversation she was too systematic she ls a woman who has laid aside the flowing robes of her sex for i the culottes of a pedagogue besides nothing about her is natural she is constantly in an attitude as it were thinking that her portrait moral or physical is being taken she attaches too much importance to her celebrityshe thinks too much of her own opinions one of the great follies of this masculine woman is her harp she carries it about with her she speaks of it when it is not nearshe plays upon a crust of bread and practises with a piece of packthread when she perceives that anybody is looking at her she rounds her arm pinches up her mouth assumes a sentimental look and attitude and begins to move her fingers what a charming quality is simplicity of character we will add to this sketch a picture of the rout of those times  m de louvois had been very wild in his youth and spent his money with marvellous facility his lather irritated by his extravagance refused to supply him with the means of continuing his disorderly career and his credit being quite exhausted he was forced to return like the prodigal son to the paternal chateau he arrived unencumbered by a second coat a largo party had been invited to dinner but as our hero expected the company to be rather stupid he wished not to appear giving his toilet as an excuse monsieur said his father  i will expect you to join this dinner party i should feel much pleasure but you see it is impossible this coat wear another i have not got it you have not one  after spending sixty thousand livres with tailors and embroiderers that would have been a very good reason formerly but it is no longer so they are all worn out get one  monsieur that is easily said but to get a coat one must have money  and at this moment  what alter borrowing two hundred thousand livres from usurersmon dieu monsieur i do not mean to contradict you but the crowns have followed the coatsm dc louvois raised his eyes and arms to heaven uttered an exclamation of anger and left the roomhe turned when he got to the door and said i will not enter into a discussion on your extravagance monsieur  but i will say that i desire to see you at my table on the appointed day and that i forbid you to appear there in the coat you now wearthe chevalier was stunnedembarrassed he knew not what to do the paternal mandate was positive and he had no hope of future assistance from his father if he did not obey him now isle called his valet a second scapin and they put all their wits to work to find some means of getting out of this dilemma but in vain human invention seemed unequal to the task the chevalier was distracted  he paced his chamber in dismay when casting his eyes upon the hangings which represented the marriage procession of alexander and statira a sudden thought struck him ah  said he  i know what i will do go into the village and bring me the tailor with all his implements immediately and tell him to prepare to spend the night here but m le chevalier go immediately and do not replywhen the valet had left the room lie proceeded with the greatest coolness to take down though curtains off his bed and laying them on a table marked out the figures he admired most the tailor was broughtcome my man said he you must make a coat vest and culotte out of this be sure to choose the handsomest ladies for the front nnd this high priest with his long bearii will do very well for the back the valet and the tailor thought and with very good reason that their young master was losing his senses but he was so determined that they were obliged to obey the suit was finished in time and fitted extremely well the chevalier was very well pleased and having completed his toilet descended to the diningroom which he entered with an imperturbable countenance he was received with shouts of laughter his father was very angry but this public disgrace obliged him to open his purse for his extravagant heir who with fresh funds returned to paris he became very intimate with mademoiselle colombe an actress at the italian comedy and in a transport of gratitude he one day asked her what he could do that would give her pleasure send me some chatons precious stones said she to make a necklace next day she received a box full of little cats rthich are also called chatons this jest was j equally well received at court and in the greenrooro which unfortunately are beginning to have only too many things in common some fresh amusement soon succeeded and this refined witticism was forgotten of madame de genlis and her eternal harp madame

of sympathynot too coarse to figure in the assemblage of our nicest company while drawing upon the  old judgev colonial sketches we must keep clear of the earlier part of his first volumesince it chiefly contains matter published elsewhere but shortly after we have closed the account of though balls at government house c and other official solemnities to which it is devoted we arrive at pleasures and people more unsophisticatedand will look in at a merrymalcing called  a pickinick stir given on the occasion of a launch of a large timbership of thia festivity one miss sally horn may be called the queenat all events she acts as cltorut to the  old judge who sits beside her at b table miss horn observed that  pickinick stirswere stupid things for a lady had nothing to do but walk up and down and stare which xvnrnt wholesome for weak eyes and as for preaching as she called the speeches she could hear enough of that of a sunday but pronounced the repast the best part of the entertainment and evinced the sincerity of what she professed by the justice she did to everything placed before her well i declare she exclaimed  if i havent dined well its a pity for i have been helped to everything twice and five times to blueberry pudding squire said a man seated on the opposite side of the table and addressing himself to barclay squire may i trouble you for a piece of that are applepie to your left there pointing to a large tart the top of xvhich had been accidentally crushed  with great plensure he replied  and applying a knife and fork to it remarked  i believe you are under a mistake sirthis is i rather think a pigeonpie and this one must have been the father of the flock for my knife makes no impression on him i xviii give you the whole bird and you must dissect it for yourselfhere it is and he raised on his fork amid roars of laughter during which the table was nearly overturned a childs shoe that had been accidentally thrust into it and lost in the deep and capacious dish well i declare said miss sally if that aint little lizzy finks shoe she has been hopping about all day xvith only one on like a land gosling if she haint put her foot in it its a pity  dont it beat all natur that i wonder xvhat business children have to pickinick stirs they are for everlastingly apoking their noses or fingers or feet into something or another they hadnt ought to a second course of maize is  improved by the sprightly damsel in the same pleasant way in a moment every one took an ear and raising it to his mouth xvith a hand at each end of it began to eat the colour of the corn and the manner of holding gave the xvhole company the appearance ofa band playing on the flute it was the most ludicrous sight i ever beheld it was a sort of practice in dumb show after miss sally had finished two ears of it 6he drexv breath and rested a moment  why dont you eat  6he said  you had better begin soon cr it will all be gone and then looking at the long white cob from xvhich she had so expeditiously removed the grain with her teeth and holding it admiringly by the end before she deposited it on the plate she continued  them cobs are grand for smoking hams or herringsnothin in nature gives the same flavour and as for corking bottles they are better than boughten ones will you hand me the dish  with great pleasure but had you not better take a little wine first well i don  icare if i doshe replied and holding a tumbler instead ofa glass observed  i like wine better than cider for conart it has more body and is a more cheerfuller drink unless the cider be first frozen down and then bottled tight with corn cobs heres to you sir and wishing you luck when you bottle cider it must be always upended on its neck for bottoms are thicker than heads and aint so apt to go off onexpected  and cider is a wicked thing to burst we must treat the reader to two more touches of miss sally shortly afterwards the whole company rose and n benevolent matron present proposed that xvhat was left of the viands should be given to the negroes who were in attendance i guess said miss sally you might as well then butter the tablecloth then for excepting the shoepie which nine fit for no christian to eat unless its a darkey i dont see there is anything else left   the black musician to whose superior knowledge and authority in such matters all deferred now summoned the young people to take their places on the gteen will you dance said my fair friend i replied  i am sorry i am obliged to bid you good bye and leave you for i have an engagement elsewhere this being altogether an unexpected pleasure to me   mr rafuse several times reminded the talkative lady that she was keeping the company waitingdont be in such a plaguy pecky hurry she answered sharply if you cant wait get another partner dont you see i am bidding good bye to the stranger manners before measurespray dont detain him i said mr barclay and i will be at the crossroads next week if the weather is favourable and spend a day or two there shooting and the rolling frolic she inquired doubtfullyoh certainly i shall be delighted to accept your kind invitation good bye till we meet againthen i may dependcertainly i shall only be too happy come now i like that she said you are the rael grit every inch of you seeing youre a touch above common i was afraid you would be too proud maybe to come among the like of us poor folks thank you sir good bye  mind next week and now john how sorry i am i kept you waiting so long whats become of nabhy frisk i seed you with just now she looks as yaller as a kites foot whats that tune pompey you are aplaing is it  oh he goes to mirimiheeno miss its come tickle my nose with a barley straw oh my  she replied pressing both her hands on her sideb and laughing most immoderately those who are not familiar with the humour of merrymakings in the border counties of england or the nooks of the principality will hardly admit that this blithe and hungry damsel is of british extraction yet such is her pedigree and her family is not yet extinct on this side ofthe atlantic  the keeping room of an inn where a party of  travellers is bound fast by snow discloses to us another original in the person of mr stephen richardson but this is a being the like of whom we hope and trust is extinct in the  old countrysince his shrewdness only make his impudence and obtuseness so much the more intolerable the snowedup party regales itself in the old but never too old  decameron fashion  and he contrives to spoil every story and to intrude his  apropos with a coolness and ceaselessness which are masterly we commend to all such as love what is clever his tale of  pete balcoms letter the length of which places it beyond our reachthe case being one defying all abbreviation let us offer his illustration of high life below stairsa new version ofthe city belle in a country house it made a great talk you may depend in clements when it was known hans mader was married at halifax and had brought back a townbred wife with him oh creation  what a wife she was for a farmer she was like a nighthawk all mouth wings lego and feathers    oh  how old marm mader opened her eyes and stared when she seed this crittur come home for her to wait upon that could nt spin or knit or hackle or weave or milk cows or churn butter or make cheese or do any airthly single thing on a farm the poor romantic millinersdoll sort of thing was so awful disappointed so unused to country ways and so lonely and wretched she was to be pitied too she actilly almost starved to death in the midst of plenty for she couldnt eat any thing they had she hated smoked herrings the flavour of dry codfish made her faint pickled pork was too fat and rancid salt beef too hard and indigestible and brown bread only fit for the penitentiary while fried ham and eggs actilly poisoned her though the country looked so green and beautiful she couldnt get out and was a prisoner to home the grass was always wet and she could nt walk out without spoiling her clothes or catching cold the goat once gave her a bump so hard nothing but the big pillow saved her life to get out of his way she climbed over a great high wooden fence and tore her gown all to pieces  and when she got into the field there was an enormous nasty brute of a bull with his tail curled up in the air and his nose bent down to the ground aroaring and apawing dirt with his feet as savage as possible and he nearly frightened her to death and to escape from him she had to run to the next fence and half clambered and half tumbled head over heels over that wellit waslike going outof the fryingpan into thefire for the clover there was long and tangled like a net and tripped her up every step and the thistles hurt her ancle3 and the grasshoppers got up her legs and the black flies down her back and the mosquitoes nearly bunged up her eyes when she got to the road she felt safe and there xvas a pond there and an old wild goosy gander xvith his beautiful long graceful taper neck and black ribandlike stripe round it and his small head and bright eye and his old white xvife of a tame goose and their mongrel goslin she never saxv any thing half so handsome in all her life and she stopped and wanted to pet the young ones when old norxvester made a grab at her waist and held on like a foxtrap and beat her hips so with his wings she xvas black and blue and hurt her arms so bad they were all numbed for they hit awful hard blows i tell you ob she ran and screamed and fang out penandink like any thing but what is the use of running or screaming in the country  there is no one there to hear you or help you if you do there xvamt a living thing near her but an old mare and ber colt afeeding by the wayside and they neighed nnd squealed and joined in the race too at iat thc frockxvaist gave way and down dropped the goose and toddled back to bis family and off went the disconsolate bride to her home too well home xvamt free from c nations neither for the old folks kept such awful bad hour it upset all her habits for they went to bcd 60 early she could nt sleep till near morning and then thc cocks crowed as if they xvere raving distracted at their wives snoozing so long and the cows called alter their calves and the pigs after their food  and this quiet peacable farmhouse appeared to hern sort of toxver of babel to get a little rest and be alone by herself she took a book and xxent to the beautiful grove that stood on the point of land that ran out into the magnificent basin and opened such splendid view and xvent into the pretty little summerhouselooking building there to sit doxvn and enjoy herself when just as she opened the door she was nearly knocked over and stifled by clouds of sawdust smoke for it xvas a smoke hut for curing herrings and the bench eenaniost poisoned her it smelled so horrid where the fish xvere cleaned she xvas in a peck of troubles thats a fact still it didnt seem to take the nonsense out of her whenever she xvent among the neighbours she made them stare she talked so fine and so foolish about balls at masons hall picknics at mnabs island steamtrips up the basin the parade and the military band and the fashions nnd so on she took me in hand oncest and ran on like a millstream about a regatta nnd the theatre and how well captain drill of the 15th and major halt of the 18th and colonel march of the 7th performed and what a charming little afterpiece the farce of high life below stairs was thats a farce says i  marm we see played every day of our lives without going to a theatre for it hans has been acting a part in that for thia while past andi am glad he has got a woman of sense for   his xvife now that xviii not let him make a fool of  i himself any longer i dont understand you sir  she said well it aint easy to see them things all i at oncest my dear friendsays i but you will come   to see it all in its right light afore long i make no   doubt   if our transatlantic relatives command the i finest  water privilege in the worldand we  must now add  gold privilege in

have dammed and sealed up in the englishman till the spring is lost and the metal degraded let us listen for a columns length to  a middlesized but remarkably powerful and active man of about thirty years of age he was standing in the middle of the room holding a long hunting whip xvith the thong doubled in his hand and shaking it at the person with whom he was arguing isle was dressed in a blanketcoat that reached to his knees cut in the indian fashion trimmed with red cloth and bound round the waist by a belt of the same colour a large loose pair of grey woollen stockingscovered his boots and trousers on his head was a lowcrowned furcap made of otterskin from the back of xvhjch was suspended a black tail four or five inches in length his neck was enveloped xvith several folds of a yarn comforter similar in colour and appearance to his sash a long e i iron spur strapt on his left heel completed his equip ment his countenance at least all that oould be seen of it for he wore an enormous pair of untrimmed whiskers which united under his chin nnd protruded over his neckcloth and wrappings exhibited a singular mixture of firmness quickness of temper and good nature  while his bright restless eye peculiar forehead and expressive mouth denoted both cunning and humour  ah said barclay as soon as he got a glimpse of him  here is master zeb hunt he ia what our friend stephen would call a pippin or a regular  barroom bird he is a drover and horsejockey and lives on the road and is the pest of every tavern and the torment of all travellers for he talks so loud he can be heard all over the house   mr hunt lifted his cap to barclay as he entered the room a mode of salutation not very common in nova scotia a short free and easy nod of the head being infinitely less troublesome nnd ceremonious and therefore in more general use morning to yousquire he said in his accustomed loud tone and familiar manner i am glad to see you i have been waiting for you for sum time to look at a horse i have here that will just suit you he is great thats a fact a perfect case i assure you isle can trot his mile in two minutes and thirty seconds nnd no break shufflerack or pace but a handsome round tnt with splendid knee action not pawing the air like makebelieve nor pounding the road like breaking stones but a sort of torchmelightandgoeasy style like the beat of a gals finger on the pianny and so gentle a child can manage him when you want hija to go take up the reins and hes off like a fox when you want him to stop throw them down and hell stand all day the way he makes the spokes fly round in a wheel so that you can only see the rim as if it was a hoop is amazing it frightened nie at first and i aint easy scared by a horse he is a kperior animal beyond all doubt i never was suited before in all my life nnd i dont know as he aint spoilt me so i shall be suited agin sometimes i cant part with him any how for i cant never get another like him  and sometimes i take a notion into my head i ought to sell him as it is too much money for a poor man like me to have in a horse youve heard tell of heber of windsor havent you  well hes crazy after him and if he dont know a good one when he sees him he does when he tries him and thats mre than most men do id like you to have him for you are a judge of a horseperhaps the best in these parts though ive seen the leak put into you too afore now youiwill take good care of him and i wouldnt like to see the critter knocked about like a corn he will lead your tandem beautiful and keep his traces up without doing the whole work and filling himself a thread will guide him and then he knows how to slack up a goingdown hill so as not to drag the wheeler off his legs oh hes ii doll his sinews are all scorpion tails and whipcords nnd hes muscle enough for two beasts of his size you cant fault him in no particular for he is perfect head or neck shoulder or girth back or loins stifle or hock or chest and bastions and as for hoofs they actilly seem as if they was made a purpose for a trotter in fact you may say hes the greatest piece of slut ever wrapped up in a horsehide come and look at him and judge for yourself my price is two fifty  but if you like him say the word and he is yours at two hundred dollars for id like you to have him i consait hell suit you to a notch and do me credit too heavens nnd airth  aint he the boy to slip by the officers tandems club to halifax like wink and you a sitting at your ease pretending to hold him in and passing of them nodding and laughing goodnaturedlike as much as to say  dont you wish you could keep the road now youve got it squire barclay said a man who had just removed a pipe from his mouth for the purpose of placing it with a tumbler of rum and water squire you have heard zeb hunt talk afore today i reckon i have been listening to him while he has been arunuing on like a millwheel apraising of his horse up to the very nine as the pink of all perfection but he never said a word about his soundness do you mark  if you intend to make a trade with him i guess you had better be wide awake for he is too much formost folks a man must rise early in the morning to catch him nappingwhats that you say you leatherlipped rascal retorted the pippin as he advanced menac ingly towards his accuser  how dare you put in your oar when gentlemen are bantering for a trade you ewenecked cathammed shadbuilt lopeared onderbread villain you measure other folks corn with your own bushel and judge your neighbours by yourselfabout as bad a standard as youll find any where squire he continued turning away with apparent contempt from the man xvho had traduced him if there is any one thing i pride myself upon in the world it is on being candid i am straight up and down  what i say i mean and what i mean ill stand to i take all mankind to be rogues more or less and xvii its more canting hypocritical rogues too for they pretend they are honest all the time they are cheating the world and the devil now i am straightforward open and above board i pretend to nothing i wont say ill not get the advantage if i can in a horse trade or any other trade i dont deny it i avow it open what sort ofa deal xvould it be were i to get the disadvantage always why in six month i shouldnt have a horse to trade xvith for what is trade if you come to that but gambling with the chances in your favour i am not bound to tell my horses faults i dont like to dwell on thc faults of my friends i praise their virtues people dont cry stinking fish in a giniral way in any market i xvas ever in yet because folks have nose and can smell for themselves i dont talk of sprains curbs and ringbones people have eyes and can see for themselves and if they are too plaguy careless to look whose fault is that no sir i scorn a dirty thing i conceal nothing i say publicly i expect the advantage in a bargain and if i cant get it i dont trade thats my rule sir  and i dont care xvho knows it i hate and despise pretence the worlds tull of it every man in a giniral way has moro cloaks to cover his villainy than shirts to cover his back here we must stop such us hold our faith respecting humour will not be surprised to hear that the  old judge can tell a pathetic or a terrible story as successfully as lie can  trot out the above tremendous

absolutely necessary when he was working they had to go short iii order to pay avliat they owed but of what there was easton himself without knowing it always had the greater share if he was at work

superfluous matter and repetition she has not done either duty satisfactorily repetition has not only escaped her pruningknife but there is also at least one apparent hiatus which rightly or wrongly we have debited her avith in the interests of novel  readers to whom the subject is little known it ought we think to have been explained that the descriptions deal with men masters and conditions of work and life far below the average and we feel a measure of sympathy with the impatience that his fellowworkers expressed at the authors socialistic discourses there is a measure of truth in the latters contention that they are not informed as to the rootcause of poverty the nearest ave get to it is that it is the outcome of private monopoly today it is too much the fashion to shelter the individual behind the system it is at least open to question avhether if workers secured control there avould be safetysecurity of decent life and fair avagesin numbers alone and no one can be blamed for questioning also avhether the more educated vorkingman should not educate his felloavs better before the majority take control nevertheless ave commend this work to the sociologist and the

philanthropists by robert tressall grant richards 6s net although this socalled novel is said to be the work of a deceased socialistic housepainter we strongly suspect a dual authorship the story of the bitter struggle of the poor painters who work for a slavedriving firm is terribly realistic the complete knowledge of the miserable conditions under which they lived is certainly firsthand the dialogue is of the kind not likely to be overheard loose jests oaths and curses with a perpetual use of the forbidden word it is a painful and possibly only too true picture of labour under its worst conditions but the real purpose of the book cannot be mistaken it is merely the repetition of wornout attacks on christianity and the exploitation of an impossible and utopian scheme of socialism in the form of speeches and lectures put into the mouth of the painter owen in a style and manner quite different from the rest of the bookin fact a rather weak essay on socialism laboured into the rough and ready dialogues of the workmen this weak and obvious device whether the work of the original author or not tends to spoil a book which at least has the merit of giving a remarkable glimpse of

read two interesting chapters of her literary a new portrait of selma lagerlof career her genius is of northern growth and in the book by which she first became known in england i gosta berling everything was northern there was northern imagination and fervour but there was also northern fog and northern cloudy grotesqueness italy then drew her and the influence of clear air of a country of exquisite line was seen at once in her sicilian story there is a wonderful artistic advance the northern imagination and fervour did not vanish but instead of kaleidoscopic fireworks she gave us an infinite series of well defined and effective pictures in the present book north and south are represented and her manner changes according as she deals with one or the other she is always a poet only sometimes an artist her northern stories are fairn stories and their real characters are fairies and trolls unhappily for our clear conception of them she calls the trolls and fairies men and women to the infinite confusion of nonscandinavian minds the southern tales here have no more poetry in them perhaps rather less but instinctively she is led in them to methods of simplicity she no longer

first in england to call attention to the merits of the new swedish novelist miss selma lagerldf and to predict her success it is always pleasant to have ones anticipations realized and few modern authors have become so popular in a short time as this talented lady two independent english translations of the book with which she took the swedish public by storm nine years ago gdsta berlings saga have already appeared while that still more remarkable work antikrists mirakler came out almost simultaneously in swedish and english in germany and denmark she is already a favourite the present volume is a combined version of two independent stories  en herregardssagen and  drottningar i kungahalla and both of them more than justify the very high expectations entertained of frdken lagerldf by her admirers the very strangeness of her genius is one of its chief charms her domain lies cn the out skirts of fairyland and there is an otherworldliness if the expression may pass about her most real and convincing characters the mysterious borderland between spirit and matter wherein dwell the fancies of children the delusions of the insane or semisane and the dreams of the fanciful has no secrets hidden from frdken lagerldf she possesses the art of interpreting all its manifestations with rare swtic force and feeling the visit of mistress rief to munkhyttan is an exquisite piece of symbolism worthy of hans andersen at his best indeed the naivete and tenderness of this delightful author frequently remind us of the great daneminus his humour which is strangely absent from these pages and yet stranger still we never feel the want of it we do not remember soeing any of miss brochners work before but we must heartily congratulate her on her excellent translation of a by no means easy book it is a pleasure to have to do with so faithful and intelligent an interpreter of genius and just because her version is s  far above the average we must point out a few errors into which she has fallen through carelessness or inadvertence in order that they may be corrected in the subsequent editions of this delightful book of downright stupid blunders there re none at all

miss brdchners english trips  e waited that it should go for waited for it to go curtseying for dogs  instead of  curtseying to dogs these however are but trivial points but once or twice miss brochner garbles her author and this is a more serious matter thus to take but a single instance there is a very pretty nd characteristic description of an oldfashioned bed as follows   hogt uppe vid taket satt en amorin och fal ide ned brokiga sparlakan ofver henne och nere pa siingstolparne sutta andra amoriner och lyfte upp dem i festoner  high up near the canopy sat a cupid and flung down particoloured curtains over her  and down below on the bedposts sat other cupids and lifted them up in festoons the authors meaning is obvious the drowsy little girl looking up at the lofty distant canopy of her bed sees a sportive cupid flinging down curtains at her from on high but his fellows below more goodnatured stop them in their fall and hold them up in pretty festoons for her delight now in miss brochners version this pretty idea is entirely obliterated  at the top sat a cupid holding sic the brightly coloured hangings and on the posts sat other cupids which held them up in festoons this is both bald and inaccurate and as unfair to froken lagerlof as it is unworthy of the translator  fiction from a swedish homestead by selma lagerlof heinemann 6s a critic in a hurry needing a rapid classification of this author might call her with some justice a swedish olive schreiner but only with partial truth for she is more than that simpler more charming more inspired more

mind at work all the time and a very beautiful mind too rich in love and pity for weak human nature were we allowed but one adjective for this collection of stories and parables we should stand by the word beautiful but as a matter of fact selma lagerlbf disarms criticism she is herself not to be changed by blame or praise her writing is we imagine little pleasure to her in itself and is valued only for its effect for every page has its purpose that purpose is the enlargement of the boundaries of the kingdom of charity and human kindness  and this artless swedish lady with her warm imagination her curious literary tangents and her gift of concrete imagery is as acceptable a missionary as has latterly gone forth in the cause we do not see any point in stating judicially that in one place miss lagerlof lacks conviction and in another shows too much credulity these things are secondary not that the book is by any means a mere collection of tracts but there is a moral in all of it the fine free way of gosta berlingthat odd rushing richlytinted generous taleis not present although in one of the stories we have another glimpse of two of ekebys cavaliers this is quieter more pensive the first story which is very charming very simple and long enough to be called almost a novel tells of a demented man won back to sanity by love the second storyalso longis a kind of history for peasants of king olaf the saint an odd blend of mythology and christianity giving may be as true an impression of that innovators character as has been achieved after this the stories are short and various the best perhaps being the peace of god which tells how an old man lost in the snow was saved by a bear and how on reaching home again he at once instituted a bear hunt the bear slew him and his family despite the esteem in which he had been held deemed his want of gratitude so base that they refused him all funeral pomps in our lord and st peter another fable for simple minds the

B3513,['8534275'],  the return of the native the return of the native by thomas hardy smith elder and co there are many indolent readers who when they open a novel like to plunge into a lively conversation or an exciting scene at once and lav down the book impatiently if their interest is not aroused on thc very first page to these mr hardys book will appear dull because they will not read far enough to be interested but persons of a more patient disposition will be well rewarded for thc task which we are compelled to admit is not quite an easy one of mastering the long descriptions of the groud bonthy furzy briary obsolete country in which the scenes of this story are laid wc j warn intending readers not to be alarmed at the verbose eccentricity which distinguishes its opening chapters nor to be repelled by the uncouth language often closely verging on coarseness in which the conversation of the natives of egdon heath is carried on the obvious imitations of victor hugo are confined to the opening chapters or at any rate reappear only at rare intervals throughout the work while the intimate acquaintance with and real affection for the suitoundings of his tale displayed by the author almost reconcile one to the repeated and prolonged emphasis with which he dwells on them the book is not crowded with characters as is too often the case in modern novels only three women mrs yeobright her niece thomasin and eustacia wye and three men wildeve young yeobright and the reddleman have anything to do with the development of the drama of course there are other characters but although some like christians are fresh well drawn and very amusing they play no part whatever and only serve to fill up the background the result of the skilful handling of these few persons is a concentration of interest steadily increasing tc wards the middle of the third volume after which unfortunately the sudden and unexpected removal of the two most interesting because most inexplicable actors leaves the stage blank and bare it is not usual for authors to kill off half their dramatis personce long before the book ends but from mr hardy we cannot expect anything usual on the contrary the originality and freshness of the work is such that these very qualities at first prevent our perceiving its full strength when after eleven months in london we first reach a remote alpine valley surrounded by weird rocks and cold glaciers the strangeness of our surroundings will for a few hours not allow us to enjoy their full beauty so it is with the  return of the native there is no heroine in it and nobody at all like anybody of whom we have read before nor is there as far as we can make out any hero one wedding takes place in the first volume another in the second and a third at the end of the book but the first two are not at all satisfactory and we suspect that no one will care much about the third the reddleman who acts throughout as the deus ex machind is apart from his redness which is inseparable from his business of selling dye the only character whom we think we have met before under the garb of a supernaturally intelligent amateur detective we do not propose spoiling the pleasure which attaches to the unknown and unexpected by betraying the plot but it may fairly be objected to the slender framework of the tale that if its conclusion had been pleasanter it would have lost none of its interest and would have been a great deal more satisfactory it appears to us that mr hardy had gradually become tired of working out the singular characters of eustacia and wildeve and not seeing how to get them out of the inevitable mess into which no unnatural events but their own innate weakness brought them had killed them off to get rid of the difficulty such an expedient if expedient it be is unworthy of the author and we are convinced that a little more patieuce would have been well bestowed on the third volume again clyni hardly betrays his tendencies with sufficient explicitness to permit us to feel that the course of life he at last adopts is quite natural notwithstanding our sympathy both with him and with his lofty aim we feel that he was made for something greater if not better and the interest the author arouses for thomasin is we believe much milder than he expected for it is evidently his wish that we should be satisfied with the quiet happiness she obtains while in reality we are perfectly indifferent to it eustacia is so obviously mr hardys favourite that she becomes ours also we are therefore disgusted with her misery in the second half of the novel and disappointed with her sad end notwithstanding these imperfections which are perhaps not faults but only idiosyncrasies of the author the book is one which deserves a better fate than merely to be skimmed and then thrown aside not only is it far very far above the ordinary three volume novel but and this is much higher praise many parts of it will bear reading a second time and will then be better appreciated than at the first hasty perusal the return of the native makes us expect very great things from mr hardy if he will only work slowly and patiently,social

straightlacedall which introductory rattle is as she defines it a  taking ones things off before she sweeps into the presence and astonishes the public by her exceeding liveliness when we add that belle gives us an index without any paging being noted our readers perhaps will infer that belles husband may have a shirt but that he is not particularly likely to find buttons upon it from the letters of this lady who taps st paul on the cheek assuring him that he is her model hero of a christian man we take belles views of her sisterwomen at washington  a word touching the great and allengrossing topic of dress may not be uninteresting to your fair readers as i have before written the newyork ladies as a general rule are the best dressed ladies in washington in this respect we are hard to beat not that we wear richer fabrics or costlier jewels tout au contrairc some of your southern belles beat us in their nightly display of laces and diamonds and in  low necks and short sleeves but the more tonnish of our newyork ladies whatever fondness they may have for precious stones and spider web trimmings think it vulgar always to wear them and as to low necks we ieave them to  low people in the presence of oertain distinguished ladies here i have felt grateful for the use of a pink fan to conceal my blushes hide oh hide those lulls of snow kc now do not think me squeamish or prudish i am not a bit of it but there is a time and a place for all things  and a miscellaneous gathering of promiscuous people is not the proper time and place for a stunning exhibition of a beautiful bosom one of the brightest looking and most sweetly dressed young ladies i have met here is the graceful brighteyed dignified daughter of the late judge woodbury of newhampshire i have only seen her in immaculate white and with only her swanlike throat bare but her courtesy in the lancers would take me off my feet if i were but i am not here are other ladies at st louis  the society of st louis judging from what i  saw at a wedding jam is decidedly metropolitan j almost cosmopolitan many of the young ladies  have been educated in new york and at the  bridal gathering at which i had the pleasure of j  assisting i met three or four opening flowers who  had just graduated from mme oakhillsand mme candas with all the airs and graces of those model institutions one of these was pointed  out as the greatest heiress of missouri worth more than her weight in gold and pretty and accomplished besides her temporal as well as her eternal charms by the natural law of gravitation surrounded her with admirers the mode of entertainment struck me as somewhat novel as well as liberal and expansive the bride is the only daughter of a distinguished lawyer and although his house is a very goodsized one yet wishing to accommodate the multitude of his friends he borrowed the me of the adjoining house and gave his guests the freedom of both still as i have said the party was a jama caution to crinolineand the dancing was kept up vigorously until five oclock in the morning the bride was not beautiful but brighteyed and intelligent and she went through her rile with as much selfpossession as though she had been married a dozen times many of the ladies were pretty two or three were handsome nearly all old and young mothers and maidens marred the effect of their symmetries and hid the beauty of their hair by most elaborate and unartistic devices called headdresses take a look at grecian statuary ladies and unartificialize yourselves in this particular there is no ornament for the head of woman like the natural glory of a clean soft simply arranged head of hair if i were a man i should always feel as if i would like to put my hand on such a head smooth it pet

grand alimentary canal of a continent the vast valley through which it flows seems to me like a new creation and its porous cottonwood forests that fine its banks for a thousand miles look like the arboreal experiments of nature preparatory to more useful and ornamental production the cities we have passed cairo memphis vicksburg and natchezdisappoint me in size and appearance and the scattered and raggedlooking cotton plantations wear a dreary lonely aspect our captain a finelooking man six feet four who is both mant and galhtnt has done all he could to make the trip a pleasant one and his namesake and clerk has been most gentlemanly and attentive the fare has been good and hannah the chambermaid with her low soft sympathetic voice most assiduous in her attentions the principal entertainments have been afforded us by the variety of cargo taken in at the numerous landings and among other goods a drove of hogs which it took an army of darkies a couple of hours to persuade on board afforded infinite fun it was pig vs nig and such a grotesque struggle i have never seen the gentlemen in the forward cabin have also had their own fun by playing off a practical joke upon jo the barkeeper jo is a goodlooking wag who is rather fond of playing goodnatured  tricks upon travelers and the clerk of the boat has been watching an opportunity to pay him in his own coin and this is the way the thing was done among the livestock on board there is a flock of nine hundred sheep penned up as closely as they can stand the clerk complaining that he was liable to be cheated in the fare by a miscount proposed that the sheep should all be marked and numbered the job was a difficult and a disagreeable one but the ever ready and obliging jo volunteered for the task and with brush and markingpot in hand descended into the woolly mass and proceeded to business wben he had got fairly at work the captain tipped the wink to the passengers and all went down to witness the performance there stood jo in the centre of the flock with his coattails tucked up under hib arms his face at a red heat and looking bewildered at the task before him with a faint glimmering perception of the joke that it would be just as difficult to count the sheep after they were marked as before the party of spectators broke into a roar of laughter and jo looking a little  sheepish but taking the joke very good naturedly hurried out of the pen with all possible haste we have taken on board two small droves of negroes one of ten boys and girls mostly the latter bought in richmond for a plantation near vicksburg they cost the owner all expenses included about ten hundred and fifty dollars a head i asked the bestlooking girl of the lot her name she said it was cinderella slaves like the early christians have but one name and that her master had bought them for his own use i asked what that meant and she said to work on his plantation and not to bell again they all seemed perfectly satisfied with their emigration to louisiana another lot of twenty were taken on board lower down the river and were on their way to the neworleans market to be sold all except one a mulatto girl who seemed to be the travelling companion of the owner and would return with him one fellow became obstreperous and had to be put in irons among the objects of interest on the river none excites more attention than the lowly mansion of general taylor at baton rouge it is a mere cottage and a very humble one at that but as the home of a president of the united states it gives a historical character to the place and the traveller watches for it with eager curiosity from baton rouge to new orleans a distance of over a hundred and twenty miles the sugar plantations line both sides of the river and the green fields green trees with here and there clumps of orange groves rich in fruits and blossoms make one feel that the people of louisiana like the cuckoo need have no sorrow in their song no

floor is to have a partner constantly on hand everybody voted the fillmore hop a perfect success it was the best attended and the ladies looked their prettiest the room the dining saloon was brilliantly lighted  and there was a rich display of fringes and flounces of necks and necklaces a very superb looking lady from new orleans wore a bouquet of diamonds pearls and precious stones which

disciples of old isaac by giving a brief account of the sport we had in fishing yesterday and let me say in advance that every word of my fish story is true accepting an invitation from mr henry ludlam a fine specimen of a true virginia gentleman whom i met at the hop we started yesterday about 12 oclock for the  fishing grounds the party consisted of four gentlemen and no more ladies than that number of gentlemen usually desire to have with them on such an excursion i am not going to tell where we wentonly that we fished sitting or standing on terra jirma and caught as many twelve pounders as we cared to take home in two waggons and blue fish at that the strongest and gamiest fish that swims i now perfectly understand the force of the common expression as  wide awake as a blue fish my arms are positively lame from pulling them in mr ludlam who is the most expert and artistic fisherman in newport taught me how to put on the bait and then all that was wanting was skill to throw the line and strength to pull in the beautiful tinnies looking so sweet in their white vests and blue coats with distended gills that looked like red ruffles oh it was  fun alive in the evening after returning mr ludlam gave us a splendid fish supper when i learned a new sensationthe exquisite pleasure of eating the game of ones own catching today the breakfast and dinner tables of the  ocean house have abounded in unwonted piscatory luxuriesthe fruit of our  q yesterdays doings i no longer marvel at the j  angling mania having been fairly bitten with it in e the glorious success of yesterday i dont know w but i should like to enlist for a three months fishing i  voyage for mackerel cod or even for whale as i j am inclined to think the larger the game the greater i t the sport ps ladies who go fishing should i  leave their hoops at home as sitting in them on  i the rocks is as hard as sitting on a gridiron u c a bachelors ball and what belle thought i c of it j bravo bellevue eichelors you did the j f handsome thing last night that brilliant ball j  was a regular eclipser such dressing and un i  dressing of beautiful women was never before seen j in newport the fine saloon was crowded and  the tasteful pink decorations with pyramids of  i gasfixtures in the corners lighted up the scene as  the italians say a giorno sister and i had between j us a couple of beaux fresh from new york who  kept us from feeling alone in the crowd and helped   us bountifully to the  chicken fixins and other things the affair was unanimously voted a great i success and only cost the bachelors who gave it a v apiece some of the costumes were magnificent  beyond my power of description one dress in particular worn by a finelooking mother of ten children was perfectly stunningthe admiration of all the gentlemen if not the envy of all the ladies it was the richest pattern of moire antique in red and white that i have ever seen the splendour of the bodice was subdued by a lace bertha of misty fineness and the whole effect including about a pint of diamonds poured over all was dazzlingly brilliant or as mrs partington would say the tout en scramble was perfectly munificent but the oddest whim exhibited in the way of ornament was a headdress composed of gold pieces about the size of a halfeagle i did not count them up but i should think there was at least a hundred dollars worth attached to the young ladys hair by fine gold chains and dangling around her neck and ears it was decidedly a ditmffit4 conceit and reminded me of a man i once saw in new orleans who was adorned all over with gold coins of all sizes but the pretty young lady who wore them looked like an indian princess in her barbaric ornaments and surely the fashion has economy to recommend it unlike most other feminine trinkets it will always be worth what it cost another finelooking new york lady wore is her hair imitation ears of im4ivn corn as large and as natural as life my  private beau who from his long habit of writing for the  knickerbocker is always on the scent of a pun very gravely whispered in my ear that there was one beauty in the room decidedly  corned bat the fair lady need not be ashamed to  acknowledge the corn her ornament was original national and becoming and she looked handsome enough for the embodiment of the great maine institution so beautifully embalmed  in the song of hiawatha  the following is perhaps written to awe the critics since the discharge and departure of mrs woodman the gossips have had their tongues tickled by an affair  in fashionable life as it is called in which mibs  a dashing young prima donna in one of our fashionable churches appears as the party of the first part and a fashionable young man the party of the second part it seems that the gentleman had taken the small liberty as the frenchman said when he kissed his wife of making some offensive remarks touching the character and habits of the damsel aforesaid whereupon the lady louisa dresses herself for the occasion calls for a carriage picks up a female friend to see the fun and rides up and down broadway holding a neat little  rod in pickle on the look out for the offender she espied him near the  bowling green and on stepping out of the carriage proceeded to apply the cowhide to her traducer to the satisfaction of both parties the question discussed among the young mens clubs is how ought a gallant gentleman to act in a similar situation to strike back is out of the j question to run away is cowardly to seize the weapon might involve a hard struggle and

man against an enemy invisible relentless wresting every error and every accident to his own advantage some such idea must have influenced mr hardy in his narrative of the fortunes of tess durbeyfield the accident of birth and the untowardness of circumstances conspire to lay her once and again at the mercy of a scamp whilst her own struggles and inclinations are always towards honourable conduct as tesss own people down in these retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way  it was to be there lay the pity of it in dealing with  this sorry scheme of things entire mr hardy has written a novel that is not only good but great tess herself stands a credible sympathetic creatuie in the very forefront of his women angel clare the hero is a thought too perfect his errors are readily condoned by himself and the author in accordance with his plan does not stop to insist upon them overmuch so that sometimes one is driven to ask whether the touch of satire suggested by the name has not prompted mr hardys representation of the character alec durberville lover and sensualist is the most boldly designed of villains the very embodiment of a reckless passionate  child of the devil and those who havo complained of his swift conversion from virtue to vice convict themselves of ignoranco in the psychology of though sensual man  sir john durbeytield

pathetic incidents abounding in the book each of them falls naturally into the picture each by his very existence throws into relief the figuro of this imperfect woman nobly planned who like the

lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the durbervilles who derive their descent from sir pagan durberville that renowned knight who came from normandy with william the conqueror  never heard it before   there have been generations of sir johns among you and if knighthood were hereditary like a baronetcy as it practically was in old times when men were knighted from father to son you would be sir john now   you dont say so  murmured durbeyfield   in short concluded the parson decisively smacking his leg with his switch theres hardly such another family in england daze my eyes and isnt there said durbeyfield  and here i ve been knocking about year after year from pillar to post as if i was no more than the commonest feller in the parishand how long hev this news about

purbeck marble canopies and shall we ever come into our own again  ahthat i cant tell and what had i better do about it sir asked durbeyfield after a pause oh nothing nothing except chasten yourself

forard  said a shyer girl  as he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on tess durbeyfield whose own large orbs wore to tell the truth the faintest aspect of reproach that he had not chosen her he too was sorry then that owing to her backwardness he had not observed her  and with that in his mind j he left the pasture upon theso two pegs the story hangs i jack durbeytields determination to obtain j recognition from though younger branch of though j family involves tess in ruin after she has  weathered though storm and buried though offspring of mischancethe scene of the baptism where tess urged to desperation by her inability to get her infant regularly christened rouses her little brothers and sisters and names it  sorrow is one of though most impressive moments in recent fiction she goes forth to commenco life anew once moro she meets angel clare and ere long  they were converging under an irresistible law as surely as two streams in one vale although tess acts as one rightly and consciously under though famous celtic curse  j name theo a destiny that thy side touch not a husband necessity controls the battle of two contrary inclinations and she is forced into wedlock without being ablo to declare though one thing that shamed and sullied her fair life to the reader it seems as if a certain moral insensibility prevented claro from acting promptly as a gentleman should and the wellmeant cruelty with which he visits her driving her out once more to be though sport of ever evil wind appears like fatuity hero is the one fault of construction in though novel mr hardy does not make it sufficiently clear that angel clare did not know so much as he and we know nor has he sufficiently explained to the reader why tess submitted completely to durberville instead of revolting from him after his act of treachery so many women would have chosen or rather flung themselves upon the one that it is wonderful that tess should take the other course yet the strength of her affectionate loyalty joined to a certain stubborn dignity a relic of her noble descent retains our respect it is impossible not to feel for her as we feel for though most lovable of mr merediths women but was it needful that mr hardy should challenge criticism upon what is after all a side issue  his business was rather to fashion as he has done a being of flesh and blood than to propose the suffering womans view of a controversy which only the dabbler in sexual ethics can enjoy why should a novelist omhroilhimsolf in moral technicalities as it is one half suspects mr hardy of a desire to argue out the justice of though comparative punishments meted to man and to woman for sexual aberrations to have fashioned a faultless piece of art built upon though great tragic model were surely sufficient and as a matter of fact the argumentation is confined to though preface and subtitle which are to our thinking needless and a diversion from the main interest which lies not in tess the sinner or sinned against but in tess the woman mr hardys style is here as always suave and supple although his use of scientific and ecclesiastical terminology grows excessive nor is it quite befitting that a novelist should sneer at a character with the word  antinomianism and employ determinism for his own purposes a page or two later and a writer who aims so evidently at impartiality had been well advised in restraining a slight animosity subtly expressed though it be against certain conventions which some people even yet respect however all things taken into account  tess of though durbervilles  is well in front of mr hardys previous work and is destined there can bo no doubt to rank high amongst though achievements of victorian novelists  new books tess of the durbervillks  tess is a new departure in mr hardys work in  a group of noble dames a suppressed defiance of the conventions of fiction more or less perceptible in previous books became partly vocal that book however was little more than a semihumorous reminder that things are not what they seem that when castle walls are thickest there are secret doors and mysterious staires by which access is gained to freedom every great novelist one may safely surmise is tempted at times to come in upon the world where people behave as though care need and passion did not exist with the shrill cockcrow that puts delusions to flight in mr hardys case every serious student must have perceived that he has concerned himself deeply with the problems of life that he has explored the questions of theology and philosophy with an anxiety  somewhat foreign to this generation but  tes  is neither a revelation nor a new ethic it is full of teaching because it is a book  with subtle penetration entering all the myriad corridors of the passionate soul but its first aim is neither to upset nor to establish any system either of theology or ethics nor does it seek to deny the reality or the terror or the inevitableess of the transgressors penalty it is a faithful preement of one whom the writer judges to be a pure womana woman true to the idea of the sex in his first book a child in pleasure a woman in pain the book is an argument for tessan argument steeped in pa  an argument by one who knows that the core facts are against him and who does not try to hide them he hopes by revealing the soul and the history behind the facts to win the readers verdict and his appeal is to humanity in every camp of thought no one who gives mr hardy a fair heaing will deny that his book is a great and triumphant c mentone which places him with the foremost masters of english fiction it has all the charm of his former works with something that places it apart the style is sweet various and noble with coming and going lights of tenderness and power but it has a rush and movement new to mr hardy though it contains perhaps no such passage of concentrated effort as the description of egdon heath in the return of the native the resistless sweep of tess is indeed one of its chief merits some may complain of the admixture of technical terms these are but the ruins of systemsgreat and littlewashed into the river of feeling and born along with it in this case a bald epitome would be more than commonly brutal the episodes that lighten the story are worthy of mr hardy at his bestespecally all that relates to teas associatesthose im m summersaturated heathen but it is to tes and her tragedy that one constantly turns from the hour when  she was caught like a bird inaspinnge the phrase is used twicethrough the ecstatic solemnity of her lovethe deep dumb devotion of her waiting its days and nights of racking anguish to the time when the shapes of darkes  i tess of the durbervilles a pure woman faiul pesend by thomas hardy three voluwes osgood mcllvaind co 3s 6d always in the background advance and claim her she is never out of our thoughts and she will linger in them long after we dose the book as  one who learned too well for her years of the dust and ashes of things of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love we think mr hardy will be much misunderstood if in this great tragedy he is taken as dealing primarily with moral problems he appeals to the most rigid purists to the most orthodox theologians the dominant idea of presentday orthodox morality the woman pays is indeed adopted and enforced but the history of tess is the argument which mr hardy addresses to his readersperhaps half despairingly as far as they are concerned certainly hoping nothing from the pedant or the pharisee for the lax or the prurient there is nothing here the book is as pure as it is passionate and however tess may be judged by those who care to judge her there can be small doubt that it ranks first among mr hardys achievements and second to no work of its time the end is significant tesss unworthy husband and her sister march away from the black flag into a land of promise she is left dead in the depths of shame with none to remain with her but her chroniclerwhose chief title to honour it will henceforth be that he was the advocate of tess  literature tess of the d urbervilles a pure woman  faithfully presented by thomas hardy in 3 vols osgood mollvaine  co in this his greatest work mr hardy has produced a tragic masterpiece which is not flawless any more than lear or macbeth is and the easiest way of writing about it would bo to concentrate ones attention upon certain blemishes of style read the author a lecture upon their enormity affect to be very much shocked and upset by some of his conclusions in morals and conveniently shirk such minor critical duties as the attempt to abnegate ones prejudices inherited or acquired  to estimate in what degree the authors undoubtedly impassioned ethical vision is steady and clear and while eschewing equally a dogmatic judieialism and a weak surrender of the right of private censorship to survey though thing created in some measuro by the light of its creators eyes what is called critical coolness seems no doubt on a cursory view an excellent qualification in a judge of literature but true criticism when it approaches the work of the masters can never be quite cool to be cool before the lear or the macbeth were simply not to feel what is there and it is though critics business to feel just as much as to see in  so tremendous a presence the criticism which can be cool is no criticism at all the critical hardly less than the creative mind must possess the faculty of being rapt and transported or its function declines into mere connoisseurship the pedants office of mechanical appraisement one may however feel the greatness of mr hardys work profoundly and yet be consciousof certain alloying qualities but let it be said at once such qualities are of though surface only none the less with respect to the overacademic phraseology which here and there crops up in tjiis boole i myself have but one feelinga wish that it were absent this terminology of the schools is misplaced i oan feel nothing but regret for these nodosities upon the golden thread of an otherwise fine diction in a certain serse they disturb a reader all the more for the very reason that they are not like mr merediths singularities of speech for exampleingrained in though very constitution of the style and obviously native to the author nor are they so frequent as to become a habit a characteristic mannerism which one might get used to rather they are exceptional and excrescentforeign to the total character of mr hardys english and serve no purposo but to impair though homogeneity of his utterance the perfect style for a novelist is surely one which never calls attention to its own existence and there was needed only tlio omis sion or modification of a score or two of sentences in thoso volumes to have assimilated the style of tess to such an ideal nothing but gain could have resulted from the elimination of such phrases as  his former pulsating ilexuous domesticity possibly mr hardy intends some selfreference of a defensive sort when ho observes that advanced ideas are really in great part but the latest fashion in definitiona more accurate expression by words in logy and ism of sensations which men and women havo vaguely grasped for c nturiesj touching which one is impelled to askare the words in logy and ism necessarily more accurate instruments of thought than simpler phrases  recalling the other memorable case in which a great novelist finally allowed her passion for elaborate precision of statement to metallicise an originally pliant style one doubts if there was any truer psychological accuracy in the delineation of deronda than in that of silas marner mr herbert spencers diction is no doubt very accurate but probably not more so than lord tennysons fortunately however tess is a work so great that it could almost afford to have even proportionately great faults and the faults upon which i have dweltperhaps undulyare casual and small powerful and strange in design splendid and terrible in execution this story brands itself upon though mind as with the touch of incandescent iron to speak of its gloom as absolutely unrelieved is scarcely correct dairyman crick provides some genuino mirth though not in too abundant measure and sir john with his  akellingtons is a figure at once humorous and pathetic but with these exceptions the atmosphere from first to last is indeed tenebrous aud after the initial stroke of doom tess appears to us like thea in keatss poem  there was a listening fear in her regard a 8 if calamity had but begun as if though vanward clouds of evil days had epent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up the great theme of the book is the incessant penalty paid by the innocent for though wicked the unsuspicious for the crafty the child for its fathers and again and again this spectacle in its wide diffusion provokes the novelist to a scarcely suppressed declaration of rebellion against a supramundano ordinance that can decree or permit though triumph of such wrodg the book may almost be said to resolve itself into a direct arraignment of the morality of this system of vicarious paina morality which as he bitterly expresses it  may be good enough for divinities but is  scorned by average human nature almost at though outset this note of insurrection against an apparently inequitable scheme of things is struck if less audaciously upon our introduction to though durbeyfield household all these young souls wero passengers in the durboyfield ship entirely dependent on tbo judgement of the two durboyfield adults for their pleasures their necessities their health even their existence if the heads of thc durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty disaster starvation disease degradation death thither wore these halfdozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with themsix helpless creatures who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of though shiftless house of durbeyfield in one way and another this implicit protest against what ho cannot but conceive to be the maladministration of though laws of existence this expostulation with  whatever gods there be  upon the ethics of their rule is the burden of the wholo strain and a joyless strain it is whoso themo is the havoc wrought by thoso creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate   the wars aro of two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience wherein the conscience at last is calamitously victorious the hearts rent and ruined  and over all like au enveloping cloud  though dust and ashes of things the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love truly a stupendous argument und in virtue of the almost intolerable power with which this argumeut is wrought out tess must take its placo among though great tragedies to havo road which is to nave permanently enlarged though boundaries of ones intellectual and omotional experience perhaps the most subtly drawn as it is in some ways though most perplexing and difficult character is that of angel clare with his halfethereal passion for tess au emotion which could jealously guard though loved ono against his very solf but ono of the problems of though book for the reader is involved in though question how far mr hardys own moral sympathies go with claro in though supremo crisis of his and tosss fato her seducer though spurious durberville is ontirely detestable but it often happens that one3 fiercest indignation demands a nobler object than ouch a sorry animal os that and there aro probably many readers who after tesss marriage with clare her spontaneous disclosure to him of her soiled though guiltless past and his consequent alienation and cruelty will be conscious of a worso anger against this intellectual virtuous aud unfortunate man than they could sparo for though heartless and worthless libortine who had wrecked these two lives it is at this very point however that though masterliness of though conception and its imaginutivo validity aro most conclusively manifest for it is hero that wo perceive clares nature to bo consistently inconsistent throughout as hi delineator himself says ol him  with all his attempted independence of judgment this advanced man was yet the slavo to custom and conventionality when surprised back into his carly teachings he had carofully schooled himself into a democratic aversion from everything connected with though pride of aristocratic lineage but when he is suddenly made aware that tess is the daughter of five centuries of knightly durbervilles he unfeignedly exults in her splendid ancestry he had become a rationalist in morals no less than an agnostic in religion  yet no sooner does this emancipated mau learn from his wifod own most loving lips the story of her sinless fall than his affection appears to wither at the roots  but for the worlds opinion says mr hardy somewhat boldly her experiences  would have been simply a liberal education yet it is these experiences which place her for a time outside the human sympathy of her husband with all his fancied superiority to conventionalisms and independence of tradition the reader pities clare profoundly yet cannot but feel u certain contempt for the shallowness of his casuistry and a keen resentment of his harsh judgement upon the helpless woman all the more so since it is her own meek and uncomplaining submission that aids him in his cruel punishment of her  her mood of longsuffering made his way easy for him and she herself was his best advocato considering the proud ancestry whose blood was in her veius and the high spirit and evon fierce temper she exhibits on occasion one almost wonders at her absolute passivity under such treatment as he subjects her to but the explanation obviously lies in her own unquestioning conviction of the justice of his procedure one of mr hardys especially poetic traits is his manner of sometimes using external nature not simply as a background or a setting but as a sort of superior spectator and chorus that makes strangely unconcerned comments from the vantageground of a sublime aloofness upon the ludicrous tragedy of the human lot and in the scene of tesss confession a singularly imaginative effect is produced by kindred means where mr nardy makes the very furniture and appurtenances of the room undergo a subtle chango of aspect and expression as the bride unfolds her past and brings present and futuro ruining about her head  tesss voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone there hod been no exculpatory phrase of any kind and she had not wept but the complexion even of external things soeuied to suffer transmutation us her announcement progressed the tyre in the grate looked impishdemoniacally funny hs if it did not care in the least about her strait the fender grinned idly as if it too did not care the light from the waterbottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem all material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration and yet nothing had changed since though moments when he had been kissing her or rather nothing in the substuueo of things but the essence of things had changed1 one detail of this scene strikes me as a crudity in art though it may be a fact in nature lt is whoro she is suddenly aghast at though effect of hor own confession   torror was upon her white faro as ahe saw it her cheek waa flaccid and her mouth had thc aspect of a round little hole this may bo realism but even realism is eclectic and rejects more than it uses and this is surely one of those nonessential touches which drawing attention upon themselves purchaso a literal veracity at the expense of a higher imaginative verisimilitude after this durbervilles reintrusion upon her life and his resumed mastery of it are matters which in their curious air of predestination affect us somowhat in though manner of spoctrol interferences with human fates and this impression is incidentally aided by the use made very sparinglywith that fine suggestive parsimony which reveals the artists handof the one preternatural detail the legend of the durbenville coach and four thenceforward as the tragedy climbs towards its last summit of desolation and doom criticism in the ordinary sense must lie low in the shadow of so great and terrible a conception there is one thing which not the dullest reader can fail to recognisethe persistency with which there alternately smoulders and flames through the book mr hardys passionate protest against the unequal justice meted by society to the man and the woman associated in an identical breaoh of the moral law in his wrath mr hardy seems at times almost to forget that society is scarcely more unjust than nature he himself proposes no remedy suggests no escapehis business not being to deal in nostrums of social therapeutics he is content to make his readers pause and consider and pity and very likely he despairs of any satisfactory solution of the problem which he presents with such disturbing power and clothes with a vesture of such breathing and throbbing life william

finds expression in silent action even more than in family worship it is perhaps because drumtochty in its weekday clothes is more difficult of adequate portraiture than drumtochty in its sunday best that i consider ian maclarens new book a distinct advance on its predecessor i think the transfiguration of donald menzies in  beside the bonnie brier bush  trembles on the verge of unreality and that the holder of the macwhammel scholarship would have been truer to life not to speak of conscience had he preached his new learning sermon semitic environment and allrather than have acted in the possibly beautiful and certainly carlylean way he did even although he thereby pleased his aunt and the spirit of his mother here i find no unrealityalthough there is abundance of what mr arnold in his ignorance of the depths of scottish nature termed  intolerable pathos not even in the little tragedy of the servantgirl who went to london or in the loves of the close drumsheugh and the nippytongued jamie soutar and this makes me hasten to say that while there is almost no spirituality there is a great deal of emotion in  the days of old lang syne that emotion overflows its banks as often as the tochty as a matter of fact ian maclaren while obviouslynever more obviously than in his new booka humourist by nature is a sentimentalist by mission that is to say he has set himself deliberately to lay bare the recesses of simple scottish tenderness and love to oppose these realities to the socalled realism of the rougonmacquart horrors andalas that one should have to say so of the wessex of  jude the obscure and that he has succeeded is beyond doubt in the death of lily grant in  a servant lass  the author is seen at his very bestbetter than in the death of the  lad o pairts which is to me a trifle too  exalted or in the death of maclure which is too long drawn out jamie soutar plays many parts excellently in this book but his intrusion into  a servant lass preventing it from becoming too depressingly sad is perfect ian maclaren is not always it is true up to the mark of  a servant lass drumsheughs lovesecret is too long and too elaborately sustained i for one should have preferred him to remain a consistent curmudgeon to the end instead of turning out a pilgrim of love in disguise but above all things excess of an essentially optimistic sentimentalism has induced him to make the one blunder of his new book to pen the almost maudlin last chapter ian maclaren can in most respects stand comparison with mr barrie but his oor lang hame can only be contrasted and unfavourably for its author with the return of the  son from london  in  a window in thrums which appears to have suggested it the appearance of this son in thrums as a pariah the agonies of his conscience the little touches of neighbourly kindliness which ought to temper the boycotting of him as a moral leper by his old friends but which in reality only add to its pangs his return to london presumably to make a dreary best of it with  the woman who has played the devil with his life these constitute the most awful piece of real for being moral it is real scottish tragedy that has ever been published compared with the return of jamie mcquhumpha to thrums that of chairlie grant to drumtochty to drumsheughs heart andhad that been necessaryto drumsheughs chequebook seems flat and almost poor if ian maclaren is a sentimentalist of set and almost scientific purpose he is a humourist by nature if  beside the bonnie brier bush  indicated this in unmistakable fashion  the days of old lang syne places the fact beyond all question what is more it demonstrates the variety as well as the quality of its authors humour when he keeps it free from emotion as he does entirely in a triumph of diplomacy and almost entirely in  good news from a far country and in the  nippy tongue  section of jamie soutars history he comes nearer to galt than any of his contemporaries mr barrie himself not excepted i have said that a servant lass  is ian maclarens high water mark as yet but for pure and dry but not ungenial drollery there is nothing in this volume or in its predecessor to match hillocks ingenious devices to secure the renewal of his lease on good terms or the successful efforts of the drumtochty worthies to magnify their professor in a far country who happily does not die like 1 omsie jamie soutars hits as at the cockney temperance lecturer and the too confident evangelical preacher are delicious his end is perhaps a trifle overdone

a novel by mrs hiibback 3 vols london skeet continrations of fiction are always failures that it as compared with their predecessors cooper and bulwer are not exceptions although their attempts were more successful than any others the cause is not difficult to i discover if the first fiction is a good one it is complete in itself it has a catastrophe and there we leave it and if we think of it at all we like to remember it as a whole a continuation of it cannot revive an interest felt long ago we feel it to be a sort of desecration to bring the same personages before us in some new shape in new characters and costumes they are not the same to us and no skill can make them such they are strangers in borrowed manners and dresses aping the looks and tones but wanting the spirit of reality and truth mr trollope has not succeeded better in this endeavour than those greater novelists who have gone before him barchester towers is a continuation of the warden with the same heroine widowed and marrying a second time but apart from the difficulty of the attempt to coin a plot out of such materials there is the ame want of skill in the invention of a story which we had noticed in the warden m1r trollope however like his mother does not write novels for the purpose of telling a story but to exhibit character and illustrate certain phases of modern society that is the aim of barchester towers it is levelled at the religious feuds of our daythe parties that divide the church and satire is unsparingly levelled against such as do not accord with the authors opinions or iympathies mrs bold the widow the eleanor harding of the warden is courted by three suitors who are thus contrasted with one another and we are introduced to high church and low church parsons and an evangelical bishopmr trollope tendencies being strongly against the low church which he does not omit to present in the most unfavourable aspect as a novelist always can if he pleases and for which reason it is that we have systematically denounced polemical fictions as an unfair method of warfare ad a perversion of the design of fiction which is to teach virtue by example not to introduce controversy or dogmatism in the form of a narratlive apart from this objection barchesfer towern is entitled to critical praise it is clever in its sketches of character and in its somewhat malevolent satire as a satire it is amusing but it will convince nobody mr trollope has powers which applied to a more genial theme would give him a high place in fiction the same objection only to a still greater extent applies to nightshade it is an attack on roman catholicism and more especially on jesuitism the tale if it may be so termed is the attempt to convert two orphan sisters to the romish church partly for the sake of their souls but chifly for the sake of their fortunes to this end the jesuits forge a will and by forcible abduction carry off the two sisters to the continent where they are conveyed to convents first and afterwards to dungeons one charles annandale a protestant of course comes to their rescue releases them from their thraldom exposes the jesuit plots and restores the young ladies to home and fortune such is this absurd and improbable fiction contrived purposely to enable the author to give vent to extremely unchristian emotions and hatreds which he does in the style and manner of a schoolboy  the wifes sister  was mrs hubbacks most successful novel it was remarkable for its vivid portraiture the personages who played their parts in it lived and moved before usrealities and not abstractions this recommended it to favour in spite of many faults of structure and composition the rival suitors preserves the merits and avoids some of the defects of its predecessor it is a better plot and the writing is nore natural and unaffected while the characters are equally of flesh and blood mrs ilubback has profited by practice and experience be ginners are always too anxious about what they think to be style  they are not content to put their thoughts into plain words and so let their style adapt itself to their tlitughts as naturally it would and thus become their own but they must nees go out of the way to look for a dress in which to clothe their ideasand usually they copy the dress of some author already famous and so appear to the world as poor imitators if mrs ilubback continues to improve as she has done she will take a very high place in fiction we can commend tde rival suitors to the libraries it will not sleep upon the shelves  i

bentley mr anthony trollope has found more to tell of his friend the gentle warden of hirams hospital at barchester  of the various members of the wardens family it m be remembered that in the story of the warden mr pr centor harding ready to distrust himself had meekly accepted the decree of  the jupiter  newspaper that be wo an abuse and had resigned his charge of the old men who were maintained in the mismanaged charity thereupon as we now learn his disinterested conduct won for him during a few weeks the plaudits of the press the hospi tat funds were then taken in hand by parliament and the plan of the charity remodelled the post of warden with the salary reduced from eight hundred to four hundred and fifty pounds and with its duties augmented waited to be filled up how it was filled up and before it was filled what wars were waged under the shade of barchester cathedral towers between bishop and bishops wife chaplain archdeacon and all other magnates of the church of bar chester it is the purpose of this sequel to the warden to relate the new story is so far complete in itself that acquaintance with or recollection of its predecessor though desirable is not at al essential the former tale was good but this is better in the warden there were certain characters developed carefully and their creator by the time the book was ended had made the best of them real to his own mind in barchester towers we begin with them as real they speak for themselves and make themselves known promptly to the stranger without need of formal introduction the story however is quite new and most of the characters are new beginning with the new bishop of barchester whose palace is the centre of the plot for with the death of dr grantly the new volumes begin and with the true grief of his son the archdeacon whose energy and love of command mingle a natural desire to succeed to the bishopric with a yet more natural sorrow the ministry is changing when the bishop dies and the archdeacon sure of the support of the outgoing premier telegraphs news of the death to london without loss of time but he is too late the ministry has pased into new hands the archdeacon remains archdeacon to the end and the bishopric is given to dr and mrs proudie people professing liberality unfriendly to cathedral music and to all those highchurch tendencies which would be most to the taste of the chapter of barcbester cathedral they are rigid sabbatarians they meaning the lady who is both the bishop and the bishops wife the ladys pet preacher mr obadiah slope a descendant of the famous dr slop with an e appended to his name for love of euphony is made the bishops chaplain but slope has an ambition of his own to play the bishops part the question of the appointment of the new warden of hirams hospital is soon made the battleground of the contending factions into which the clerical society under the shade of barchester towers becomes quickly divided mr slope struggles with the bishops wife for mastery over the bishop and if the bishop never bad to lay his head upon a pillow with another pillow by the side of it there might be hope for the chaplain he almost succeeds the busy archdeacon cannot soil his dignity by entering personally into a contention with the hateful chaplain who has taken the first opportunity to sound from the cathedral pulpit a loud note of war but he makes use of his patronage to give a barchester living to a distinguished high churchman mr arabin competent to play very good dog to the chaplains cat moreover there is the family of dr stanhope a nonresident prebend who has been brought by the exercise of gentle episcopal pressure to reside for a few months in barebester stanhopes family is cleverly described and his daughter the beauty with the crippled feet who is the siren of the story and lures mr slope into a whirlpool is an odd character most skilfully worked out eleanor the precentors daughter widow of john bold and mother of a precious baby is the heroine of barchester towers with her for her money or her beauty or her worth three persons seek marriage the deans death opens a greater vacancy at barchester before the mighty question of the appointment of a new warden is settled mrs proudie triumphs of course over all meddlers between man and wife our old friend mr harding does not return to hirams hospital as warden and because he does not so much as know what a deans duties are in his determined conscientiousness and honesty be refuses to be made a dean but although not destined to be a deans daughter eleanor becomes a deans wife and the archdeacon attributes much of the good end to which everything is brought to his own activity in waging war against the bishops chaplain we have thus indicated what is the subject of mr trollopes novel of barchater towen but we should add that it does not depend only on story for its interest the careful writing the good humour with a tendency often to be shandean in its expression and the sense and right feeling with which the way is threaded among questions of high church and low church are very noticeable and secure for it unquestionable rank among the few really wellwritten tales that every season furnishes below the surface is another novel dealing with tvxed social questions of the day and giving much prominence to the antagonism between bighchurch and lowchurbh tu it has two hero sir regnald clinton a rocaholic with a lost son whose mother had been entrpped into a madhouse and oliver nugent of the 3aorbound farm a country gentleman by birth yeoden and working farmer by necessity a brave and congoientious man with strong religious feelings evangelical so to their colour he marries a young wife and is troubled first by the phenomenon of a hot dinner on sunday then by a croys over a mantelpiece and evangelical works in a ooalscuttle then by an unaccountable intimacy between his relative sir reginald clinton and his wife whom he refuse to distrust until a parcel found under her bed which really serves in the end to identify clintons lost son in a poor boy whom he has cherished and harboured seems to be demonstrative at once of his wifes unfaithfulness to evangelical religion and to him a story of this kind winds through many interesting details to a happy end the details are chiefly such as bring out views of english ouintry life of abuse in the management of workhouses and lunatic asylums details of life on a farm cottage scenes riots and the calling out of yeomanry with many matters of the kind the novel is one that keeps attention fixed and it is written in a genial often playful tone so that although containing much that is romantic in its incidents there is so strain for effect anywhere visible the temper of the work is throughout excellent from these two novels we pass to yet another in which social questions are discussed the siter of charity by mrs challice this is inferior in execution to the two works we have been discussing but deserves a fair position among novels of the day it deals especially with the hard lot of women who exposed to sore temptation fall into a pitiable sin  bareheskr towns by anthony trollope 3 vols longman  co enerlno the episcopal palace of barchester we find at once that  the warden was an uncompleted story mr harding is again upon the stage with eleanor tom towers and the jupiter there is however a new bishop of the diocese dr proudie successor of dr grantly with mrs proudie of evangelical ambition supplemented by a loosejointed lowchurch chaplain obadiah slope but we again make acquaintance with the loud clearvoiced overbearing archdeacon the tyrant of his father and fatherinlaw who has a theory about oblong diningtables and sets down any obnoxious brother asa beast thus mr trollope baa not to contend against the difficulty of interesting us at the outset in his personages or in his narrative wc are by no means strangers in barchester but he has perhaps to meet a worse difficultythat of prolonging successfully the interest of a tale which seemed some time ago to have been brought to a natural conclusion yet we doubt whether  barchester towers is not a more satisfactory book than  the warden it is certainly more dramatic in its construction the characters are more varied an infusion of romance gives lightness and brightness to the ecclesiastical picture it may still be said indeed that mr trollope has a happier art of drawing sketches from life and striking off pungent sayings hot and vivid upon the page than of elaborating the action of a novel nevertheless the incidents that lead up to the marriage of eleanor if to some extent conventional are yet contrived with skill and will engage the sympathies of other readers than those who appre date the excitement kindled in a cloistered city whenever a bishopric or deanery is vacant parallel with the many wooings and one love of the youthful widow moves the tearful tragedy of obadiah slopetragic in all but its consummation for though oily obadiahbeaten thwarted slapped in the face confuted confounded detected in

alliance till death them do part with the opulent relic of a sugarrefiner including a house in baker street mounts a metropolitan pulpit and ripens in the golden warmth of patronage until the soul of sweetness enriched within him suffuses his plump rotundity and he ages and mellows and excites the envy of the irreligious and the poor this reverend slope is the low church personified and it is mr trollopes pleasure to mock his ral hair large hands weazel eye and sardonic intonations perhaps some of this sarcastic finish is unfairly applied but we are to take  barchester towers for what it isa satire on men and opinions in a certain corner of the eeclesia and if mr trollope makes low church ridiculous he does not make high church sublime to say the truth the entire establishment as here represented is but a worldly wellspread table with a hundred covers for baked meats purple and amber juices glittering in globes of crystal and all the spiced dainties of samarcand and lebanon to tempt the taste of the shoeless and the scripless no stirpliee1 party in england can complain that though novelist insults it by flattery to go a little further human nature itself has not much excuse for being aggrieved on that scoreunless it be the unpolluted babelike nature of the exwarden who is satisfied that he should not holli his wardenship and that he should not accept a deaneryor the warm honest crystaltransparent nature of eleanor bold who has to rebut the courtesies of obadiah slope with a tingling blow from her ivorywristed handto reject the explanations of bertie stanhope with sweet tears from her eyes and who ultimately takes up a definite position in her mortal state as mrs arabin wife of a blameless doctor and a dean bertie stanhope is a caricature the mundaneminded dr stanhope stands dimly in the background  but the signora herself with her loveliness and her wiles her fascinating insolence and ready points of repartee is brought out with singular force and fancy with respect to the other characters signora neroni last but one of the neros in reality however only a stanhope is the most conspicuous siren among the sinful she has a beautiful face and a perfect bust but has been crippled by the violence of an italian castaway her husband infidel philosophy and sensuous vanity occupy her remaining days and with almost harrowing humour mr trollope describes the victory of her sensuous charms over the conscience the worldly scruples the heart encased in carrotcoloured flesh of chaplain slope as an example of mr trollope s boldest method ot writing we will connect two passages relating to the passionate interview between mr slope and signora neroni  mr slope as was his custom asked for mr stanhope and was told as was the servants custom that the signora was in the drawingroom upstairs heaccordingly went he foundher as he always did lying on her sofa with a french volume before her and a beautiful inlaid writing case open on her table at the moment of his entrance she was in the act of writing ah my friend said she putting ont her left hand to him across her desk  i dkt not expect you today and was this very instant writing to you mr sloe taking the soft fair delicate hand in his and very soft and fair and delicate it waa bowed over it his huge red head and kissed it it was a sight to see a deed to record if the author coidd fitly do it a picture to put on canvas mr slojie was big awkward cumbrous and having his heart in his pursuit was ih at ease the lady was fair as we have said and delicate every thing about her was fine and refined her hand in his looked like a rose lying among carrots and when he kissed it he looked as a cow might do on finding such a flower among her food she was graceful as a couchant goddess and moreover as selfpossessed as venus must have been when courting adonis oh that such grace and such beauty should have condescended to waste itself on such a pursuiti was in the act of writing to you said she but now my scrawl may go into the basketand she raised the sheet of gilded notepaper from off her desk as though to tear it  indeed it shall not said he laying the embargo of half a stone weight of human flesh and blood upon the devoted paper  nothing that you write for my eyes signora shall be so desecrated and he took up the letter put that also among the carrots and fed on it and then proceeded to read it cracious me mr slopesaid she i hope you dont mean to say you keep all the trash i write to you half my tune i dont know what i write and when i do i know it is only fit for the lack of the fire i hope you have not that ugly trick of keeping letters at any rate j dont throw them into a wastepajhr basket if destruction is their doomed lot they perish worthily and are burnt on a pyre as dido was of oki with a steel pen stuck through them of course said she  to make the simile more complete of all the ladies of my acquaintance i think lady dido was the most absurd why did she not do as cleopatra did why ditl she not take out her ships and insist on going with him she could not bear to lose the land she hail got by a swindle and then she could not bear the loss of her lover so shu fell between two stools mr slope whatever you do never mingle love and businessmr slope blushed up to the eyes and over his mottled forehead to though very roots of his hair   a nd so she continued to insult him and he continued to bear itsacrifice the world for love  said she in answer to some renewed vapid declaration of his passion  how often has the same thing been said and how invariably with the same falsehoodfalsehood said he  do you say that i am false to you  do you say that my love is not real v false  of course it is false false as the father of falsehoodif indeed falsehoods need a sire and are not selfbegotten since the world began you are ready to sacrifice the world for love come let us see what you will sacrifice i care nothing for nuptial vows the wretch i think you were kind enough to call him so whom i swore to love and obey is so base that he can only be thought of with repulsive disgust in the council chamber of my heart i have divorced him to me that is as good as though aged lords had gloated for months over the details of his licentious hie i care nothing for what the world can say will you be as frank  will you take me to your home as your wife  will you call me mrs slope before bishop dean and prebendaries the poor tortured wretch stood silent not knowing what to say  what you wont do that tell me then what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice for my charmswere you free to marry i would take you to my house tomorrow and wish no higher privilege  i am free said she almost starting up in her energy for though there was no truth in her pretended regard for her clerical admirer there was a mixture of real feeling in the scorn and satire with which she spoke of love and marriage generally lam free free as the winds come will you take me as i am have your wish sacrifice the world and prove yourself a true manmr slojie should have taken her at her word she would have drawn hack and he would have hod the full advantage of the offer but he did not instead of doing so he stood wrapped in astonishment passing his fingers through his lank red hair and thinking as he stared upon her animated countenance that her wondrous beauty grew more wonderful as he gazed onjjt ha  ha ha she laughed out loud come mr slope dont talk of sacrificing the world again people beyond oneandtwenty should never dream of such a thing you and i if we have the dregs of any love left in us if we have the remnants of a passion remaining in our hearts should husband our resources better we are not in our premilre jeunesse the world is a very nice place your world at any rate is so you have all manner of fat rectories to get and possible bishoprics to enjoy come confess on second thoughts you would not sacrifice such things for the smiles of a lame ladyit was impossible for him to answer this in order to be in any way dignified he felt that he must be silentcome said shedont boody with me dont be angry because i speak out some home truths alas the world as i have found it has taught me bitter truths come tell me that i am forgiven are we not to be friends and she again put out her hand to himhe sat himself down in the chair beside her and took her proffered hand and leaned over herthere said she with her sweetest softest smilea smile to withstand which a man should be cased in triple steel there seal your forgiveness on it anil she raised it towards his face he kissed it again and again and stretched over her as though desirous of extending the charity of his pardon beyond the hand that was offered to him she managed however to check his ardour for one so easily allured as this poor chaplain her hand was surely enough by far the larger proportions of  barchester towers is ecclesiastical in its interest but we have quoted that which will show that mr trollope is not occupied only with the dialogues and dealings of church men or church matters it should be added that tom towers oracle of the jttpikr is an ally of obadiah slope and thunders in his behalf in vain,social
B2250,"['4372131', '9428028', '8485575']",  reviiws of books our mutual frien mr dickens has now been so long before the public and his name is associated with so many triumphs some of which were achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born that he has already obtained the position of a classic and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time he has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood the collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes the characters he has invented would almost people a town and we might well excuse an author who has done so much if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time but mr dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having outwritten himselfl his fancy his pathos his hmour his wonderful powers of observation his picturesqueness and his versatility are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago in some respects they are seen to still greater advantage the energy of youth yet remains but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years not that we mean to say mr dickenshas outgrown his faults they are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard a certain extr vagnce in particular scenes and personsa tendency to caricature and grotesquenessand a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic as if the author had been considering how the thiqwroulld  tell  on the stageare to be found in  our mutual fried as in all this great novelists productions but when a writer of genius has fully settled his style and maintained it through a core

on general faults of manner there they are ma there they will remamy ws hat we will the tender rind wein they were cut in youth has become hard bark ong ice and the incisions are fixed for ever to

and fantastic wanting in reality and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story mr dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection for in the very interesting  postscript in lieu of preface which he has appended to the second volume he says there is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact therefore i note here though it may not be at al necessay that there are hundreds of will cases as they are called far more remarkable than that

more wills than were ever made by the elder mr harmon of harmony jail we do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact and it is not to the terms of mr harmons will that we object but to the

her we venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up the termination of mr dickenss novels is often hurried and such is the case in the present instance the complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process but is so to speak roughly tonne open and even before we are half through the book the mystery concerning john rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner young rokesmith or harmon tells himself his own previous history in a sort of mental soliloquy in which a long series of events is minutely narrated evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader it is surprising that so experienced a romancewriter as mr dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design yet notwithstanding these defects which we have pointed out with the greater freedom because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic the story of  our mutual friend is interesting for its own sake even apart from its treatment which we need not say is that of a master if we except these points already objected to we repeat what we said at the commencementthat in conception and evolution of character and in power of writing this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw considered on artistic grounds are eugene wrayburn lizzie hexam bradley headstone and bella wilfer the first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature originally noble degenerating under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness into a laughing indifference to all things worthyinto a gay and sportive disbelief in itself in manhood in womanhood and in the world from first to last the conception is wonderfully developed and the change that is afterwards wrought in eugenes disposition is worked out without the smallest violence in strong contrast with the goodnatured levity of wrayburn is the stern selfcontained narrow yet within its contracted and mechanical limits earnest nature of bradley headstone the selfeducated schoolmaster liue hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact she is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can getdead bodies among the restand who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess the girl  however is a fine sensitive being handsome and of a deep tender nature and when eugene wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver he takes an interest in her fate and has her educated his interest deepens into love yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage bradley headstone also is in love with lizzie and the way in which his impassive artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love jealousy and some pungent taunts which wrayburn gaily flings at him is exhibited by mr dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness the transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark haggard selftormenting evil genius per tually dogging the steps of eugene wrayburn and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river is one of the finest things in fiction bradley headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest and we are peruaded of the profoundest truth natures like his originally cold and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of selfcontrol mr dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of bradley headstones wrath in the attempted murder of eugene all the preparations for that at and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions are managed in mr dickenss highest style and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness we are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake of nature to which novelists should be superior that this carcter is sensational  but the genius that could conceive it has dothilg to fear from such objectors very touching and beautifsl the character of lizzie hexam but probably the greatest favourite in the book will beor rather is alreadybella wilfer she is evidently a pet of the authors and she will long r m the darling of half the households of england and america pererse petulant wil wrongheaded not a little inclined at first to be selfish and aneyloving she is yet a bewitching little creare and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak they are so numerous but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of betty higden and little johnny her gre andchild that the poor old creatures pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from mr dickens in the final words from which we have already quoted a declaration of his views on the present administration of the poor laws  in my social experiences since mrs betty higden came upon the scene and left it i have found circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the poor law my friend m1r bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and i have been called upon to admit that i would give poor law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow patting this nonsense aside i have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some union houses the other admitting that there are such pcor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do the records in our newspapers the late exposure by the lancet and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences but that my view of the poor law may not be amk or misrepresented i will state it i believe there has been in england since the days of the stuarts no law so often infimously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised in the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanityand known language could say no more of their lawlessnes we must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls dressmaker fantastic and semipoetical yet with a deep instinct of truth her drunken fathera sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein mr dickens is quite unrivalled bellas father a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature the podsnaps and veneerings and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers male and female by whom they are surroundedportraits admirable for the social satire they embody rogue riderhood and some of the other hangerson about the river we might almost mention the river itself as a character it plays a most important part in the story and always with great picturesqueness we cannot refain ere we conclude from referring once more to the postscript for the sake of its allusion to an event in whidh at the time we were all deeply interested on friday the 9th of june in the present year mr and do

afford to lose such a writer as mr dik a man of original creative genius dying in the fulnes of bis strength leaves a gap which nothing can fill and a regt which the memory of his past triumphs only deepens and embitter  our mutual friend by charles dickens with illustrations by marcus stone 2 vols chapman  hall a new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture or of qualification for a simple yet serious reason those who with understanding as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise have followed mr dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him carelesswhether as concerns his art his public or himself as little have they spoilt or dimmed or turned aside his quick sympathies his power of minute observation his keen desire to advocate what he deems right his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success the boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture but may he not ponder too long and oversolicitously  this question we fancy may be asked with respect to  our mutual friend only the other day ita author gave us that french story of little bebelle one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with sternes shandyisms only yesterday out of a dingy street in the strand from no more promising place than a lodginghouse the artist by a touch brought to light a homely loving fellowcreature worthy to  sit above the salt among the best of the best mrs lirriperas real  a being of the mind  as mr pickwick as mrs gamp as the micaivbersas any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist whom we know intimately in all their strength and weakness and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words if therefore we say that during its course of fragmentary publication  our mutual friend has raised more question than certain of its predecessors the circumstance arises from the nature of the story and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion none of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale it would be wasted labour to detail or analyse a chain of events which every one has already handled enough to state our conviction that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links from the first number it was evident to us that the murdered john harmon was not murdered but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will for the purpose of testing her real nature the circumstances of the deed which led to his shipmate radfoot being mistaken for and murdered with himself are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity some incompleteness referable to partial recollection may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelists partmay belong to the nature of the catastrophe but it produces an impression of uncertainty then again the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises which bear unfavourably on some of the characters we fancy the conversion of bella wilfer the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister to be somewhat too suddeneven though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing mr boffin this avarice again however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared has of necessity implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched the honest truthful boffin of the mounds whose simple rightmindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of bella the oddlydesignated bride ofthe great fortune but his inability to carry such a longdrawn piece of subtle comedy through we beg respectfully to our great novel ist to question and we are satisfied that bo greathearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever or any desire to lead on a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with wegg after the discovery of old harmons second mil in the house of the anatomical curiositymonger that which belongs and befits a detective policeman apt at disguises as mr bucket of nevertobeforgotten memory sits ill on an honest ignorant affectionate creature such as he is and though we love mrs boffin the comfortable and instinctivelydelicate woman one of mr dickenss most genial creations with all our hearts we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance truth and nature are here strained in subservience to the requirements of literary art we fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story harmon its hero is by his position betwixt light and dark inevitably partially effaced bella the coquetish daughter of mrs wilfer the stupendous is capitally touched in the chameleon hues of her character and royally righted at last but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring then lizzie hexam though not precisely a sketch has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the readers interest lastly we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy humble affectionate and beneficent as riah the hebrew on any grounds of compact obligation or sophistry lending himself one hour after it was known to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as fledgeby the usurer the meanest creature this is saying much as yet created by the hand that painted the moneylenders in  nickleby and brats and kroolc and fagin and uriah heep the explanation made by him at last to the little weird dolls dressmaker shows us that mr dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation which is insufficient to convince us we cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness somewhat similar in miss edgeworths  ormonda tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom  every man has his hand thus much by way of qualificationor call it speculation ratherconcerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without stop let or hindrance on returning to the characters that of bradley headstone the schoolmaster dogged sensual unreadyhis tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position takes the foremost place among them as an original conception frightfully though he suffers even though when he confronts wrayburn his pococurante rival there is a show of reason and of championship on his side there is no possibility of any ones feeling a moments pity on his behalf so utterly is the masterdesire of his life rendered unlovable by the forms in which it is clad there have been many murders and many pictures of remorse in novelsand none more powerful than the pages in which we were shown the wanderings of bill sykes and the slinking home of jonas chuzdewit after his bloody deed in the wood but mr dickens has exceeded even those in the scene where the wretched criminal tortured by the rebuking consciousness of his having failed in his diabolical design is dogged and dragged back to the fatal spot by his nideous confidant nothing can be mon masterly as a display of blank inevitable retri j bution and wretchedness redeeming touch  there is none about bradley headstone  even j the concealed love for him of the softhearted i prim little schoolmistress delicately indicated as it ia fails to furnish it to change the fancythe author of  pickwick never revelled among richer whimsies than are to be found in the comic parts of this talein the veneering household and the guests assembled by it the mistress of the man  sion and of the camels on the dinnertable with her readiness to weep her

they say on the stage boots and brewerare all new people in print whom every dinerout has met every  week of his life in private the vivacity and  variety of this division of the novel are admirable but when talking of dinners in our mutual friend we nuit not forget the most  incomparable dinner of all that of the newly  married couple bella and john at greenwich for the sake of the sentimental waiter the young man on liking so ignominiously thrust aside by the archpotentate in waiting who conceived that he had alone a right to the solemn monopoly of the secret of the day j we must stop  though touchesand traits rise  on us hythe hundred justifying what has been said that our mutual friend is one of mr dickenss richest and most carefullywrought books if we demur to wegg and to miss jenny wren as to a pair of eccentrics approaching that boundaryline of caricature towards which their creator is by fits tempted wecannot recall anything more real more cheering than the sketch of the milveysclergyman and clergymans wife lxth so unconscious in their selfsacrificing virtue and goodness yet the two so capitally discriminated by the extra touch of zeal and briskness and suspicion of the jews on the womans part it might be suggested that too much space is given to the impostorcouple the lammles and their designs on podsnaps poor foolish little daughter but again how capitally thrown in to the womans part is its scrap of shame and of remorseful feeling her figure ere she quits the scene unconsciously sketching on the tablecloth with her parasol is not to be forgotten as marked by that attitude and occupation enough then has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded and to prove that on its being read and read again every lover of types of human character every student of art in fiction every man who has  humour in his soul will find each and all enjoyment if as regards broad outline there are former stories by mr dickens which we preferif among his tales we rank the highest  david copperfield which includes so to say neither plot nor surpriseour mutual friend must be signalised for an accumulation of fine exact characteristic detail such as would suffice to set up in trade for life a score of the novelspinners wno give us situations without motives scenes without characters words without thoughts and the dialogue not of real life but of melodrama  the literary examiner our mutual friend by charles dickens with illus trations by marcus stone in two volumes chapman and hall latinised races accuse english writers of a disregard of unity in works of art and yet there is no great english work of imagination that does not recognise it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action we rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time and although we recognise even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot but a wellharmonized relation of all parts to one central thought ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based every great english work of imagination every good work of art all the world over is as it were a crystallisation of thought about some one central idea nowhere perhaps is the sense of this true unity so perfectly shown as in the literature of england in shakespeare grave or gay it is distinctly seen every turn of the light trifling in loves labours lost every character of the play blends with the rest in a poets graceful jest over the taste of his day for idle ornament in the plot nothing is done all the ingenious rhyming of the courtiers agrees with the state of don armado with the j brave outside who being called upon to strip to his shirt and fight owns that he has not a shirt to his back under all his bravery in the merchant of venice the play crystallises round the central thought of the relation between justice and mercy law and gospel in king lear earthly sovereignty breaks like a bubble on the wind as it flies through the stir of the grand forces of nature in julius casar the central thought is the problem of government the supreme sovereignty of caesar the philosophical republicanism of brutus the selfseeking republicanism of cassius and all other parts of the play show as it were the different faces of the crystal of which all parts have their harmonious relation to the single point of thought if we turn from shakespeare to fielding in tom jones broad as the canvas is on which that work is painted and crowded as it is with various incident there also we find every detail tending to ono centre the idea of the relation of man to society jones and biifil are types of the two opposite halves of the social world jones faulty but honest his faults open and incurring blame biifil keeping the faults of a worse nature secret giving a fair show to the worst acts and escaping blame in the relation of man with society open truth is contrasted with false seemiog and the episode of the old man of the hill is contrived to provide for the middle case of the man who cuts the knot of tiie social problem by avoiding conversation with his fellows mr dickens invariably fulfils in his novels this condition of deep seated unity which has been always recognised in english art all readers can feel that he does so and some readers who have paid little attention to good literature have raised thereupon arguments upon the propriety or impropriety of  writing with a purpose as tf any thing worth reading anything worth seeing anything worth hearing were ever produced or uttered without the purpose to express a distinct individual meaning of some sort there must be in every good novel play or poem one true thought for the mainspring that keeps all ita wheels in action and we must start from the mainspring if we would trace properly the movement of the works in this novel of our mutual friend the argument is of the soul of life smong the fictions of society we are shown in the first chapter lizzie hexam a truehearted girl in a position as degraded as imagination can conceive without stain to her inner purity she is bringing a pure heart to a revolting way of life ber father supports a wretched home among scum of the riverside by fishing for drowned men in this girl chiefly but not in her only we are as the story grows to see the radiance of the aoul of life we turn from her and the deep social degradation of her outward life at onoe in the second chapter to the other side of the books argument the fictions of society these are typified throughout by the friends collected round the dinnertable of the veneering the veneering themselves have their root in nothing being social jonahs

whose character at every period full of light and shade is shown also in process of developmentour literature does not contain a happier study of light girlish grace advancing with no loss of charms into a pure womanly earnestness bella when young believes that she is sordid she has come out of a mean home into the daily relish of what wealth can buy is guest and friend of mr and mrs boffin social nobodies who happen for a time to sit on the gold heap with homely honest hearts that love of gold can never spoil then the boffins join with bellas lover to whom really all the gold belongs in plot for the girls education and the fetching out of the true soul of life known to be in her boffin covers himself with gloryand much mystifies the reader of the novel by appearing in the character of a man spoilt by wealth and turned into a greedy miser everybody knows how the story runs and so we need not describe at length or quote any of its passages we would only show that in this central plot also of our mutual friend as in the outlying incidents connected with it the inner thought of the book ia still the same is of the soul of life greater than all the fictions of society to this design belongs the sharp contrasting of such characters as mr and mrs boffin and mr and mrs lammle the story of the strong heart of betty higden who showed qualities of heroism in avoidance of the workhouse  the weak intellect with malice and greedy cunning in fledgeby the weaker intellect with love and the tender spirit of selfsacrifice in sloppy how full of a quaint generous humour again is the sketch of the dolls dressmaker little miss wren with her broken back and feeble frame her precocious wit sharpened by trouble in which the spirit of childhood casts its golden threads across the dull woof of her life of care and whose kindliness is at times touched with a malice as of childish playfulness familiar with bitter years of trouble nobody who reads this book as a whole can fail to be struck with the ingenious arrangement and skilfnl conduct of the story bead piecemeal it was satisfactory only to those who had faith in their author the secret of mr boffins little plot is so well kept that while it was in action they who believed their old friend to be shown to them ss really spoilt by wealth believed unwillingly and sometimes may have rashly supposed that here the masters hand had lost its cunning in fact if we look back to those scenes in which mr boffin enacted the part of a miser we shall be surprised to see how skilfully and freely the novelist scattered what with the key to it all in our possession we see clearly enough to be indications of the true state of the case the wealth of wit poured over all the pages of this book would be an intellectual harmons estate large enough to set on horseback every wegg of a literary gentleman with a wooden head we may say if we will that here we like and there we dont like any character or passage but far above desire to criticise by the small way of personal comparison between our individual tastes and opinions and those bf our author is the keen enjoyment of bis genius and after all there is the strictest justice in the heartiest appreciation of a liveliness of fancy that spends all its gaiety in quickening the honest sympathies of life of a pathos that derives ita strength from a firm hold on the realities of life a perception of character that seizes accurately types of men presents vividly their distinctive characters and all tinged with the observers humour that is to say with his own

B406,['9400236'],  a girvs wanderings in hungary by h ellen browning longmans  co believing hungary terra incognita of which  beyond the mere name very little was known in western europe miss browning determined to explore it this bulky volume is supposed to recount her experiences but its perusal leaves the reader doubtful as to whether it is what it professes to be or only a work of fiction in her preface the writer disclaims the idea of being able to write a book  full of adventures and hairbreadth escapes as  things of that sort dont fall to the lot of a nineteenth  century girl even at the other end of europe but really she is too modest her book teems with deeds and episodes not only marvellous but verging on though miraculous hero is the record of one of her earliest feats performed shortly after her arrival in hungary 44 apropos of interference i once horrified my friends most terribly on this point we had walked one morning a couple of miles along the banks of the danube outside the city and came across a slav peasant castigating his young wife with a leathern strap this sight awoke the lust of murder in my heart i felt just like sic king saul must have felt when he hurled the javelin at david fortunately for everybody concerned there was no javelin in my hand  nothing in fact except a muff but purple with indignant rage i sprang upon the man and shook him by the collar like a terrier shaking a rat the following is a lively account of the weather she encountered in hungary  44 violent thunderstorms occurred several times during august also hailstorms of the most devastating character these used to begin suddenly a raging wind would arise  the air would be filled with dust man and beast would run for their lives to the nearest shelter doors and windows were often torn off their hinges before they could be closed  trees and shrubs were uprooted roofs sometimes blown off bodily and then came the hail a blinding sheet of solid lumps of ice about the size and shape of small pigeons eggs came rattling down furiously breaking every pane of glass unless the outside venetian shutters had been closed over themonce i gathered a tumblerful of these enormous hailstones and kept them in my room till they melted it took them just about fourteen hours to dissolve into fluid in the shade so much for miss brownings own personal experiences the following terrible tragedy she relates from hearsay only referring to the way in which the jews gradually squeeze all their possessions from the peasants of hungary even as they do from those of russia she tells of a certain israelite who lived in a transylvanian village and lent money to the peasants there  for years and years he had lived amongst them and become by degrees the possessor of farms flocks and herds the widow and the orphan were his particular prey and one morning after he had turned a dying woman out of her cottage on to the road his fate overtook him her neighbours found her dead by the roadside with a little child crying in her stiffening emaciated arms they took her corpse up and carried it away and their hearts burned within them there was indeed an inhuman devil in the world one who abode in their village and sucked the very lifeblood from their veins the news spread like wildtire this brutal act was the last straw even a worm will turn and these worms turned to take a terrible revenge the men and women gathered together in silencetheir hearts too full of vengeful thoughts for words they only looked at each other with gleaming eyes and set teeth at last one man spoke  4 he is a damned devil a veritable limb of satan no human beast could act as he acts time after time he has skinned us figuratively let us skin him nowwe will we will so help us god we will  answered a chorus of deep indignant hatebreathing voices and they did next day the pester lloyd gave a long account of the barbaric vengeance practised on a jewish innkeeper he had been skinned alive and then plunged into a cauldron of boiling water naturally arrests were made by the police and somebody suffered the death penalty miss brownings assertion that her volume is not to be regarded as a contribution to the eternal sexquestion  is wide of the mark ner references to sexual questions are not only frequent but different from what one might expect in a work issued for unrestricted circulation take for instance her remarks upon the roman catholic clergy of hungary who she would appear to fancy are unlike other priests of their faith in being vowed to celibacy  priests she says are not permitted to marry  but housekeepers of the youngest and prettiest description are allowed also nephews and nieces this struck me as being a neat way of getting round an awkward corner euphemism cannot be said to have died out entirely yet somehow the term  celibate clergy  always sticks in my throat i object to the rankly hypocritical not contented with returning again and again to the charge against their clergy miss browning includes the whole magyar race in one general indictment of immorality in proof of her allegations she recounts such incidents as this at ardd where she is conversing with the hostess of an inn   she told me amongst other things that she was in a great quandary her maidservant had been taken ill the day before and she was at her wits end to know how to get through all the work till her return  is it likely to be a long illness  i enquired   oh no  the child arrived a couple of hours after she left here and she s going on capitally  but she wont come back under ten days or a fortnight i rn sure  she never does this is the third time i ve waited for her but she s such a good girl i d rather wait than hire another 44 4 the third time  but why doesnt the man marry her  44 4 which of them does though gracious lady mean  44 4 which  welleither of them  444oh theyre all too poor for her to marry them her father wouldnt give her to either one of them she s a beauty you know and rich too such hair such eyes such a tongue  shes never at a loss for an answer to anybodyshe ll make a good match when she does marry  thats very certain why  her dower wont be a kreutzer less than fifty florins besides linen and feather beds and poultry yes indeed gracious lady the man who gets her for a wife may deem himself a very lucky fellow 44 4 but the three children and these goings on  444pshaw gracious lady what of them thats nothing to do with her husband  besides hasnt he done the same himself with other girls  can he expect better than he gives  no no  justice in everything if you please although miss browning asserts that she is only twentythree she must have enjoyed an extensive and varied experience she alludes to visits to countries all over the globe intimates acquaintance with all kinds of arts and sciences past present and to come and claims to be conversant with several languages various philosophies and indeed more things than are dreamed of by most men truly she displays a smattering of colloqtiial german but the depth of her french may be gauged by the quotations with which she garnishes her book such as 44 coffee a la creme 44 on a change tout ga 44revenons a nos moutons 44toute au contraire and the like her latin citations are equally erudite and unfortunately she never mastered enough hungarian to comprehend its simplest forms or to write the names of its bestknown men correctly whilst her disquisitions on its philology are simply ludicrous her pet english quotations are also faultyunless indeed we except her slang in which so far as we are able to judge she is proficient in facf the volume is an incongruous collection of mistakes misstatements and platitudes yet it is not irretrievably bad or we should not have taken the trouble to notice it there are several interesting pictures of hungarian home life and descriptive bits of folklore likely to escape the notice of casual travellers and at times especially towards the end of the book the authors style becomes picturesque and even brilliant had some experienced literary friend revised the work and expunged the flippant vulgar and indecorous sentences that is to say onehalf of the bookthe remaining moiety would have repaid perusal,social

the sequestered bower of her fine art taking wide views keeping her own counsel it seems strange to say of a novelist who has filled five hundred pares with chosen words that she keeps her own counsel

not reveal herself even dramatically she is the greatest thing that a writer of fiction can bea moralist but there is no person in this story to bear the charge of the character and in this extremity

downright virtues of muscularity so far so good but we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where mr jack london fails we do not wish to disparage in any way the son of the

in which the two authors bring the same situation before us is to see why mr jack london cannot be called an artist he is a vigorous story teller for the general publicwhich is not a bad thing but his

his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild

combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story

forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we

protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is

B8169,['8519142'],  heathcote of gangoil harry harry hcathcotc of gangoil a tale of australian bush lift by anthony trollope low and co this novel of mr trollopes possesses the double merit of being short and extremely interesting but ws should think lbe would have encountered some difficulty if he had tried to get it published under the auspices of an emigration agency it professes to give a faithful picture of the society of the queensland  bush and of the struggle for existence among the various members of that society which although limited is still sufficiently   ci a naynniqt1ie interests the five drin large to contain antagonistic interests the five principal elements that take an active part in mr trollopes story are squatters freeselectors hired workmen thieves and mosquitos of these the mosquitos are the only animated creatures that seem thoroughly to enjoy life next to them come the thieves whose policy it seems to be to squat on a small leasehold property and to make that a basis of operations for stealing the sheep and cattle of their neighbours the danger of detection and imprisonment or hanging is a certain drawback to the charms of this easy life but that is so slight in a thinly peopled country that the squatter whose notions of property are primitive and elementary as those of paleys pigeon might be ideally happy but for his rivals the mosquitos when however we ascend in the scale of queensland society we have a painful illustration of the cares of greatness and of the advantages for happiness possessed by those at the bottom of the ladder as mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,social

prepared to say offhand how many different artists have interpreted the christmas carol  since john l eech illustrated it on its first appearance but we have no hesitation in saying that miss appletons eight paintings are worthy to rank beside the best of those illustrations by her many predecessors she is not much concerned with the humour the grotesquerie of the story but we doubt if the poetry the grace the tenderness and fantasy of dickens were ever more delicately or more sympathetically depicted than they are in her drawings her scrooge should have been a little grimmer a little harder of feature perhaps but her tiny tim and bob cratchit and the rest of his family are delightfully natural and human she is very successful too in dealing with the eerie ghostly elements of the narrative her wintery nights have the hue and atmosphere of winter and the spirits that haunt them are veritable things of mist and bodiless we congratulate both artist and publishers on this

long familiarity with cruikshank  phiz  and mahoney one is always apprehensive of a new illustrator of dickens it is not that our visualising of a dickens character has become stereotyped but a

method of suffusing his mind with that  christmas atmosphere the loss of which is a common matter of lament in these prosy and practical days there are probably many others who find that the magic of

chambers this new edition of  a christmas carol with its fine bold type and coloured illustrations by a j keller  a christmas carol  will always have an abiding place in the affections of the general reader it is not merely that the characters are life  like but that as someone has aptly said of dickens  he is a portrayer of living souls rather than of living men it is here that the secret of the great novelist is found to read a christmas carol with a responsive mind is to be brought into rapport with the essential spirit of humanity and to be awakened to the true meaning of fellowship with the world especially the struggling heroic and kindly portion of it the present repoduction of covy chambers volume should make an acceptable a n d a p prop riate christmas gift to all but those

that is exactly suited to his genius pickwvick might have been too beefilv real and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while he worked the result is a beautiful and ideal edition of the ideal christmas story,social

parents and herself a christian but she loved a jew that is the first sentence of this novel and the whole novel is a very simple and very chaming history of the maidens love and the troubles into which it brought her and through which it bore her it is a lovestory and nothing more but if we are tired of lovestorie we shall find the book delightful reading by reason of its lively pourtrayal of the ways of life half mediaval and half oriental in the quaint old capital of bohemia and if we want a novel with a purpose we shall find in it a very trenchant argument against the hundredheaded i prejudice which would raise up barriers between the membm of diferet religions or different uatioalitis or dissert iocaul anel instead of aseing bonds of univm  sympathyand kindliness in the goam on

car about prng him for the deeds but he is anxious to obwn what is his by right and his son anton trendellsohn who now chiefly camres on the business of the house is yet more anxious on the subject he it is whom nina loves and her love makes her also anxious that the deeds should be restored to their owner therefore when she horrifies her rich kinsfolk by telling them of her betrothal to the jew she further enrages them by demanding the production of the mising documents they on the other hand find a new value in their possession as there is a chance of their being useful in breaking off the match therefrom grow nina balatkas chief troubles anton trendellsohn scornfully refuses to be bribed by the restitution of his own property into the relinquishment of a project from which his fathers threat of disinheritance does not for a moment deter him but when he is solemnly assured by christian after christian that the paper is in ninas own possession and is withheld by her for treacherous purposes of her own his suspicions are aroused thence comes much unhappiness to her to which is added the lesser troubletrue lover that she isthat her father is slowly dying nor are these all she knows that many years before her first meeting with anton it had been arranged especially by the elder trendellsohn that he should take to wife a beautiful rebecca loth and though she is assured that anton never loved rebecca she knows that his reversal of this plan and his marriage instead to a hated christian will bring upon him many difficulties she knew it before but she sees it more plainly after the visit which her rival pays to her nina rose from her chair directly she saw her visitor and came forward to meet her i suppose you hardly know who i am fraulein   said rebecca robe yer said nina with her pleasantest smile you are rebeccalt  yea i am rebecca loth the jewess  i like the jews said nina rebecca was not dressed now as she had been dressed on that gala occasion when we saw her in the jews quarter then she had been as smart as white muslin and bright ribbons and velvet could make her now she was olad almost entirely in black and over her shoulders she wore a dark shawl drawn closely round her neck but she bad on her bead now as then that peculiar hungarian hat which looks almost like a coronet in front and gives an spect to the girl who wear it half defiant and half attractive and there were there of course the long glossy black ourls and the darkblue eyes and the turn of the face wbich wa o completely jewbish in its bard bold almost repellant beauty nina had id that e liked the jews but when the words were spoken she remembered that they might be open to misconstruction and she blushed the same idea occurred to rebecca but she scorned to take advantage of even a successful rival on such a point as that she would not twit nina by any hint that this assumed liking for thu jews was simply a special predilection for one jew in particular  we are not ungrateful to you for coming among us and knowing us said rebecas then there was a slight pause for nina hardly know what to sy to her visitor but rebecca continued to speak we bear that in other countries the prejudice against us is dying away and that christi sty with jews in their houses and jews with christians eating with them and drinking with them i fear it will never be so in prague  and why not in prague i hope it may why should we not do in prague a they do elsewhere   ab the feeling is too firmly settled here we have our own quarter and live altogether spot a christian here

celestial qualities alike taking form and colour from what may be called the fatalities of his race it is further to be observed that the rehabilitations so to say with which the hebrew has been

on the part of his family and friends who could ill bear the thoughts of his separating himself from them to waste love on a christian girl the conflict of these sympathies and antipathies involving little or no episode and few subordinate characters make up the story which is told so clearly and tersely and with so much real feeling as to retain the reader to the last of course the marriage could not be allowed to take place without an all but fatal misunderstanding having been brewed by those whose interest it was to separate the lovers and in the agony of her heart nina was driven into the intention of committing suicide the night scene on the moldau bridge where she nearly effected her fearful purpose is well described and not too longdrawnout a picture more desolate more bitter in

gives to society a sort of diplomatic gravity and restraint which stiffens and straitlaces social intercourse here they do not like storytellers nor goodfiellows nor people who amuse the company by their talents who are so much sought after in moscow in petersburgh every one must speak from notes proceed upon plan and appear in the house when he is wanted like an actor in a comedy here every acquaintance is an object of calculation and is valued for the sake of his consequence his connections or his family every one looks on his acquaintauces as steps to the ladder of rank or fortune and gets hold of as many as are necessary for him to reach the summit of his wishes some hre received because they are necessary others because they serve to amuse necks sary people the amusement iscardplaying and so he who can play hi h is received into society in order to form a party for people of consequence pc tersburgh passes for a musical city or to speak more correctly for a city where there is much singing and ilaying upon musical instruments this is true but hence does not follow the conclusion that there are here many real connoisseurs and amateurs of music they play cards in order to avoid speaking and hear music for the same reason after dininer the subject of conversation isthe wea ther nobody likes to tell his mind here because every one is seeking or expect ing something andl in such a relicament dialogues are dangerous the frank discoursiveness of aloscow the freedom from restraint in behaviour and the oldfashioned ituisian hospitality are reckoned here unsufferable rudeness and gothic barbarity here they bid no one as in moscow at first sight to come every day to dinner and spend every evening but invite you out of favour and as every body is here busy about something or nothing you niust not visit your acquaintances except upon set lays and hours anld at fixed times in 11moscow the lan guage ot high rife is a strange medley of french and russian  but in petersburgh you do not hear a word of russian yiou must speak french with the pure parisian accent and the smallest blunder aigainst the rules of grammatical precision is noted as ignorance in moscow they sometimes speak of russian literature the russian journals and authors  but iti petersburgh that is a mark of malulris ton the learning of the great world toes not extend farther than criticising french litera ture according to the system of la ilarpe conlninlg over the articles of the wiir vial des d4afs and reading english romances in tie original not one russian writer or artist of eminence is receivel into the higher circles unless he enjo s the special patronage of some man of note there is one exception to this rule to wit a regard for moscow notability the plaster or mistress of the house on presenting a new man not known in the petersburgh world apologises by saying that he is known in moscow the youth of petersburgh even before they come to maturity gather an air of coldness in their behaviour which mnakes young people particularly insufferable and disagreeable they make their friendships not from any coincidence of taste and habits of thought but from the importance of the connexions and relations of their comrades every man who cannot do any thing for them who can neither help them forward hinself nor put them in the way by means of his friends is reckoned a useless member of society they behave towards him haughtily and even shun his acquaintance the females also are subject to the general spirit of placehunting they are as cold in their demeanouras the gentlemen and to say the least are too lead at any rate so far as outward appearance goes tenderness and sympathy follow the fashion like bon nets the ladies of moscow scold and romp but with all their faults they have hearts which feel as well as hands which help here they sigh talk most sentimentally upon morality and set lotteries agoing for the poor a petersburgh ball would appear to be undler the management of a coolerative society consisting of a french balletmaster a chinese master of the ceremonies a german knight of a rueful countenance anl an italian seenemaker every thing in its place enough of every thing but more than all enniti in moscowv on the contrary they sometimes dance out of tact sometimes the musicians go out of tune some times there are tallowcandles among the waxlights sometimes the floor creaks in the dancingroomi  after a hearty supper there is sometimes too much champaign drunk  sometimes there is more noise at a ball

B3500,"['8776630', '6760511']",  tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he affects to adopt the opinions of duchinski about the great russian race he looks for the sources of his tales in any other direction at least two of the pieces given by miss hodgetts are russian bilini or legendary ballads the last of the russian warriors  and the celebrated chant of ilya muromets whose name is somewhat disguised in the form which it assumes in her book this ulina is interesting as giving us a glimpse how vladimir the first christian sovereign presented himself to the popular imagination in russia strange to say we find next to nothing about him in his religious character if we except his contest with the idolater ilya is the most popular hero of the old yolksepos vladimir is holding high court at sacred kiev  elie ilya galloped straight into the princes court jumped off his noble steed and tied bim up to an old oakpost this done he went to the sacred avieuomu bright p palace of the prince to pray and after having offered np thanks for his recovery he

observed that the wine is green the favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious

these storiesand only those familiar with trie works of afanasiev rudclenko kulish eilenvein and others know how many there aremiss hodgetts has translated those which are most representative she

selfassurance her arrogance towards the male creatures who support her and her physical perfections has often been portrayed in fiction but it has been left to mrs wharton to expound her whole significance in  the custom of the countrv we are introduced to a state of society as chaotic crude and purely imitative as that of hayti or liberia but full of force and held together by a curious patriotism from this strange soil there rises like a flower undine spragg whose history is the subject of the book the daughter of a leading citizen of apex undine was engaged while yet a child to a young dentist of that city and ran away about the same time with one elmer moffatt an adventurer whom she married and divorced in a fortnight all this was no more detrimental to her maiden pride than water on a ducks back she had quite forgotten the adventure by the time her parents on a rise of fortune moved to new york to a splendid suite in the stentorian hotel she married into one of the best oldfashioned new york families not mentioning her previous marriage and divorce but the real aristocracy of her new relatives soon disgusted her attracted by the vulgar splendour of some millionaires she made decided overtures to one of them forsook her child divorced her husband but for once miscalculated the millionaire for reasons of his own declined to marry her and she retired to paris in a state of temporary disillusionment reviving presently she married a french count and in the course of time divorced him when she finally joined hands with the same elmer moffattnow a multimillionairewith whom she had eloped from apex city in her teens it is of course a monstrous record from the sentimental standpoint but mirs wharton by avoiding the least hint of sentiment and laying stress upon the sequence of environment upbringing character has made her heroine a natural and pathetic figure she succeeds in winning for a cold and selfish character the kindly sympathy which comes of understandingan achievement of which any novelist might well be proud undine spragg is always striving for the best obtainable as she conceives it it is her misfortune that her aims are all material and egotistic no sooner has she attained a social height than her minds eye discerns another yet more radiant and desirable this explains her strange inconstancy in the married state she has no scruples fails to see how any one on earth can justly blame her for discarding men who do not give her everything she wants with the readiness her father showed for abner e spragg whose  private rule of conduct was as simple as his business morality was complicated and whose lips were often  busy with a phantom toothpick had served her will at home   why havent we taught our women to take an interest in our work   inquires a cynical observer in the book simply because we dont take enough interest in them the slaving is no argument against the indifference to slave for women is part of the old american tradition lots of people give their lives for dogmas they ve ceased to believe in then again in this country the passion for making money has preceded the knowing how to spend it and the american man lavishes his fortune on his wife because he does not know what else to do with it  where does the real life of most american men lie in some womans drawingroom or in their offices  the passage is suggestive of a curious parallel between the freest of all women and circassian pets when on the last page of the book undine learned that as a woman who had been divorced she could not hope to be ambassadress in london she burst into an angry laugh and the blood flamed up into her face  i never heard of anything so insulting she cried as if the rule had been invented to humiliate her the cry rings truly of the spoilt circassian mrs whartons latest work is no mere entertaining story it is a courageous and at the same time sympathetic study of americans  notes on novels  these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser the country is japan on which mrs fraser is known to be an authority in this volume are tales of new japan all with enchanting backgrounds tokyo is a garden says for example the author in the first of them in which a city has grown up by accident and the flowers have the best of it still in the foreground is the stormy play of passions mrs fraser can handle her pen as indeed a sister of mr marion crawford should hutchinson 6s  the custom of the country by edith wharton 6s macmillan the heroine of this american tale is a muchmarried person undine spragg finally weds a man to whom as a girl she had been married clandestinely and from whom she had been separated forcibly by her parents then the second husband came on the scene marriage for him turns out to be a tragedy he commits suicide when undine deserts him a french nobleman is the ladys next husband and finally mr moffatt who is now a wealthy man mrs wvhartons irony calls this rapid mating the custom of her country but she is too fine an artist to exaggerate the point one of the notable features in her novel is the artistic restraint she has shown on two occasions she depicts the troubles inflicted by this divorcecustom upon the child but the pathos is not overdrawn again she draws with admirable skill the parents of undine people who have made money rapidly and come to new york in order to let their daughter get into society the description of mrs spraggs loneliness in the new york hotel of her pathetic isolation and helplessness is one of the best things in the story but it is written without overcolouring mrs wharton uses these scenes and situations in order to bring out the character of her heroine and the characterisation is subtle clever and convincing it is an unlovely plot nmrs wharton does not conceal the inner misery of a woman who is inferior to all the men she marries thanks to her greedy love of pleasure but no moral is drawn the story is left to tell its own warning it is this which makes it effective there is less bitterness than in  the house of mlirtlh though the situation is practically the same but the subordination of the satire to the artistic construction of the tale is equally prominent hardly any of mrs whartons recent novels displays quite such unity and penetration as this incisive study of the modern american woman of fashion  the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson 6s it was inevitable that mrs hugh fraser having made some reputation with a diplomatists wife in japan should forthwith collect some short stories and republish them as a book but it is a uttle unfair since there is no outward indication that the volume is made up of five tales and that  the custom of the country  is the title of only one of them and that not the first it is also rather a pity mrs fraser as she has shown us in her earlier work knows japan weu sympathises with its people and is we use the phrase in a compumentary sense an agreeable rattle but these qualities though they suffice for a couple of volumes of observant gossip are not enough for the building of one good short story mrs fraser to teu the truth does not play the game she breaks the rules with an insouciance which almost disarms criticism we will take an example from the titlestory we are sitting with thornton the hero on a balcony watching the father and uncle of the japanese girl whom he loves they are talking confidentially in the opposite house and thornton and we want to know what they are saying obviously thornton and we should learn no more than we can hear or see this is how mrs hugh fraser cheats at the game 44 but now rinzo san he said  wiu you not ask me why i came  44 for a good and brotherly purpose i ana sure replied the other trying to look unconcerned and filling up the teacups with a trembling hand  for a better purpose than yours was when you left us said his brother 441 come to undo the wrong you did and to offer ybu reconciliation and friendship from all the family 44 what am i to pay for such precious things kato san p  asked rinzo eying him suspiciously and stroking his cbio such an offer from such a quarter seemed more duvgnous than a threat 44 there is nothing to pay between brothers kato spoke as loftily as confucius could have done 44 there will be his hotel bill thought old rinzo but then ht was comforted fur kato evidently wanted something and was disposed to be polite about it the points we have italicised could not possibly have been observed by a stranger sitting on the balcony opposite mrs fraser must really learn the rules and stick to them for the breach that may pass in a novel is blatant in the short story further we would beg her not to use praughfas the past tense of  preach even in fun and finally we must point out that even if there were such a word as  anthrophoby an  anthrophobic woman could not denote a female who disliked men those who know nothing of the elements should not try to coin words  fiction american divorce i the custom of the country by edith wharton macmillan and co 6s a dmirers of mrs edith whartons books have no need to be told that any story bearing her name is sure to possess many remarkably good passages that the style is excellent and that the author knows well how to illustrate and adorn her theme yet in spite of all the custom of the country cannot be said to be a great success as a novel there is a purpose in the story a by no means undesirable and probably a necessary one but the reader feels that at times it very nearly overrides the story itself which in a novel is an error easy american divorce is the theme mrs wharton has chosen and undine spragg a beautiful girl of plebeian origin is the one upon whom the author has fixed to show the horribleness and evils of the diabolical system allowed by some of the american states it may be that undine is a type of woman evolved by the artificial surroundings of a debased society but it seems almost incredible that any society or any training could make even an american woman so heartless and callous a creature as undine is represented to be she is beautiful certainly but that is all she is never presented as a fascinating woman yet she has in her trainafter her first runaway marriage of a fortnights durationa man belonging to one of new yorks oldest and best families ralph marvell whose wife she becomes peter van degen the vulgar husband of ralphs cousin a young french marquis of old family her third matrimonial ventureand her girlhoods husband who eventually becomes her last the courtship period in each case is passed over very lightly it is with the married life and the break in each case that the book is concerned and these periods are admirably dealt with ralph and the french aristocrat have much in common each is guided by custom traditions and high honour in their private and public lifeobservances which the young american beauty never for a moment grasps or understands the only intuition she possesses is to further her own aggrandisement although she pathetically just misses her desired goal every time after doing her best to ruin the two families into which she marries she at last finds her level with her first husband now more than a millionaire thus the end of undines ventures is reached so far as the reader is allowed to know of them that the book has interest no one will deny and if it does nothing else it serves to show the scandalous state of the american divorce laws although mrs whartons purpose would have been better served had she presented a character in which the reader could more easily have believed,social

B4235,['6752459'],  the history of a slave tr xi rpi by h h johnstone kegan paul trench  co the happy thought of allowing the native to tell his own tale in his own way if not originally suggested was at all events first worked out in a satisfactory manner by mr churchward in his blackbirding in the south pacific mr churchwards hero john king bruce who draws such a vivid sketch of the horrors of the coolie traffic in the south sea islands finds a worthy rival in mr johnstones herp abu1guwah who paints a no less vivid picture of the horrors of the slavetrade in the dark continent both writers have that personal knowledge of their respective environments and especially that familiarity with the social conditions which are indispensable elements of success in this branch of halfimaginative halfrealistic literature hence both works stand on nearly the same level of excellence in their general treatment of the subject and both are about equally successful in conveying to the reader under a somewhat fanciful form a correct idea of the actual relations in their respective spheres of action where mr johnstone yields the palm to his predecessor is perhaps in the dramatic truth of his personation at least it can scarcely be aid of abu1guwah that either his language or his observations are always quite consistent with the character of an average sudanese negro as when he exclaims what curious people you europeans are you ask so many questions and you want to know so much about things that do not concern you but it should be stated in extenuation that abu1guwah is something more than an average negro for at the time he meets his european interlocutor at tripoli ho has a terrible tale to reveal of his experiences during the many years of his enforced wanderings from his native land near the western seaboard to the mediterranean shores the first thing he clearly remembers was playing as a child with the skull of one of a neighbouring hostile tribe who had been captured and eaten by the young men of his village one of the last events he has to relate is the death of his wife on the verge of the thirsty desert attracted to her destruction by a mirage which she takes to be  the great sea of bornu here in her distraught mind she fancies she sees her mother and the house she used to live in  but after  running a little way she throws up her hands and  falls down in a heap then his companions all runaway slaves like himself perishing of hunger and thirst amid the trackless sands  run up and throw themselves on her and cut her throat and greedily suck her blood presently they fall in with a caravan of fezzan traders bound for murzuk and so escape a lingering death in the sahara at the cost of their freedom the narrator entering the household of a powerful sherif in whose service he ultimately finds his way to tripoli his tale of woes and adventures filling up  the intervening years is skilfully told in such a way as to embody  a realistic sketch of life in the western sudan the impression being heightened by uniform fidelity to the local colouring and by the tact with which many incidents actually witnessed by the author have been interwoven in the general narrative especially characteristic of existence on the borderland between islam and heathendom is the story of our heros capture by a band of ruthless slavehunters who raid his native village spreading havoc throughout the district and wasting life out of all proportion to the number of wretched victims actually carried away into bondage for ever we know from nachtigais account of the state of things prevailing in the region stretching south from lake tsad that the evils of african life are intensified in many parts of this border zone where the aggressive mohammedans are brutalised by daily scenes of plunder and murder and where the pagan populations are reduced to the last stage of degradation compatible with the existence of human society remembering the scenes described by nachtigal among the arboreal inhabitants of kimre wo may well believe that there is no exaggeration in abu1guwahs graphic account of the destruction of his people by the slavehunting fulah and haussa subjects of the sultan of gashka who led him away into captivity  they captured most of the runaway party who had been concerned in the death of their brothers and brought them into the open place where we were lying chained they tied the men to stakes and tree trunks and lopped their limbs off one by one and then beheaded them they ripped up the women and lifting up the children by the feet they swung them round and dashed out their brains on the stone seats in the open square where our elders used to sit under the shade of the big trees while these things were being done a small body of the fulbe were busy burning the town and cutting down the plantations of bananas and setting fire to the dry bush outside the town so that the whole place might be laid bare and afford no hidingplace to such of our people as might have escaped all through that day some in the sun and some in the shade we lay chained together in the open square of our town and so we lay all through the night while the fulbe made big bonfires and roasted our sheep and goats then follows a picture which should be taken to heart by those who speak so complacently of the mildness of domestic slavery throughout mohammedan lands in north africa every happy slave in a moslem household represents at a moderate estimate at least ten lives and an incalculable amount of misery and atrocities  early the next morning they passed in review all of us whom they had captured which i suppose amounted to onehalf of our townspeopleperhaps some five hundred all such as were aged or deformed or weakly were separated from the others and put on one side their chains were taken off and they were told jestingly by the fulbe that they might go where they pleased but when the poor simpletons began to slink off towards the bush the fulbe with shouts of laughter began firing at them with their guns and riding them down on horseback some of the fulbe horsemen would stop for a moment and tie a rope round the ankle of one of these fugitives who had fallen down and fasten the other end of the rope to his stirrup and then ride round and round the square at full gallop till the man he had dragged with him was simply a shapeless mass of blood and bones    all we slaves whom they had selected to take away with them were marched in twos and threes to the river where we were made to wash and drink here several who were mad with grief jumped into the river though they were chained together and tried to swim down the stream but they all sank to the bottom and were seen no more nor does abu1guwah find things quite so pleasant in the households of his moslem masters as might bs supposed from certain roseate descriptions of domestic slavery in sudan and mauritania in one place he gets into trouble over a somewhat romantic love affair is tied to a stake flogged till he faints and left the whole night tied by his wrists to the stake until released towards dawn by his inamorata elsewhere he is lashed with  a greaf whip made of hippopotamus hido whereupon lowering his head ho charges at his master like a bull butting him full in the stomach and avoids a very mauvais quart dheure by making off and enlisting in the army of a neighbouring potentate and so getting tired of this happy slave life after sundry and diverse bloodcurdling adventures he plunges with others into the desert and at last reaches the fezzan frontier under the circumstances above described the horrors of some of the scenes in this part of the work almost exceed the limits of good taste and the detailed account for instance of the sultan of zinders atrocities with the doings of his executioner at the  tree of death might perhaps have been treated somewhat more summarily without much loss to the lesson these things are intended to teach otherwise there is little fault to find with the book on the score of accuracy though the student of arabic may be puzzled to know why the heros name abulquwwat as correctly inscribed under his portrait facing the titlepage should be translated abu1guwah the note at p 140 to the effect that air or airi is the name of the people of azben seems also somewhat misleading air is in fact the berber azben the negro name of this region whose present rulers call themselves kelowi that is people of owi the place whence they migrated to their upland homes in the central sahara there is neither a table of contents nor an index to the book which however is richly illustrated with numerous original drawings and sketches by the author a h keane,social

B8219,['9012145'],  janitii fair  a novel without a hero bv william makepeace thackeray bradbury  evans our readers will remember that we have already no 1030 p 783 introduced them to this latest of mr thackerays works at that time it had reached only its seventh monthly numberand the characters had of course not grown to the full proportions which they have since attained under the authors hands the mere sketches of that period have since been largely filled in and elaborately wrought up and for that reason we now return to the work in its completed state as in many respects one of the most remarkable works of modern fiction for some years mr thackeray has been a marked man in lettersbut known rather as an amusing sketcher than as a serious artist light playful contributions to periodical literature and two amusing books of travel were insufficient to make a reputation but a reputation he must now be held to have established by his vanity fair it is his greatest effort and his greatest success the strength which lay within him he has here put forth for the first time the work before us retains traces of the writers old faulta fault fostered no doubt by the carelessness and impromptu proper to serial publicationviz a sort of indifference to the serious claims of literature a cavalier impertinence of manner as if he were playing with his subject nothing could be more impertinent for instance than mr thackerays second number  in which he relapsed into his old magazine manner and postponed the continuation of his narrative to imitations of some of his cotemporary writers of fiction fit subjects for ridicule such writers may bebut the ridicule is misplaced in the work which mr thackeray had in hand considered as a work of art in the same number he becomes suddenly aware of the discrepancy between the costume of the period in which he has laid his scene and the costume in which he has depicted the characters in his pictorial illustrations all he does on the discovery is to notify the fact in a note and flippantly pretend that the real costume was too hideous for his purpose he has been guilty however of the same confusion of periods throughout the work sometimes we are in the early part of the present centuryat others we are palpably in 1848 writing from month to month encourages such laches but for the sake of such a reputation as mr thackeray has now arrived at it will be well that he should he more upon his guard jjje style of  vanity fair is winning easy nicoline felicitous and humorous its pleaunt pages are nowhere distorted by rant the jnjbortndulges in no sentimentalitiesinflicts fine writing on his readers trusting to the force of truth and humour he is the quietest 0f contemporary writersa merit worth noting  a literary age which has a tendency to mistake spasm for force the book has abundant faults of its ownand we shall presently notice some of them but they are not the faults most current in our literature the writer is quite free from theatricality no glare from the footlights is thrown upon human nature exaggerating and distorting it he is guiltless too kt us be thankful for such a boon in the sense here intendedof a  purpose unfettered by political or social theories his views of men ind classes are not cramped the rich in his pages are not necessarily viciousthe poor not aga consequence of their poverty virtuous and highminded againmany jesters take advantage of their cap and bells and adopt as their motto ridentem dicere falsum quid vetat under the plea that laughter is not a serious thing and what is laughingly spoken is not to be critically judged they have sacrificed troth to their joke no advocate of any cause however should be more scrupulously watched than he who laughing teaches against the dogmas of the politician philosopher or theologian the reader is on his defence these come in such a questionable shape that we mut examine them their seriousness alarms m we scrutinise proofs and combat conclusion but the jester is privileged he throws ui off our guard by the smile of his approach and insinuates conviction by the bribery of laughter the laughter passes but the error may remain it has gained admittance into our unsuspecting mindsand is left there unsuspected it is a muchdisputed question whether or not ridicule be a test of truth i to us the question appears answered by saying that if the ridicule be developed ab intra from the argumentnot thrown on it ab extrait is a test if a wit descries the latent absurdity grinning under a moral mask and exposes it he has confuted the argument if he himself grins and makes faces at the mask he may excite laughter hut has not carried confutation a famous illustration of the former method is the reply made to that philosopher who argued with a sort of seductive plausibility that the emotion inspired in the heart of man by the sight of womans bosom is owing to association of ideasto his dim remembrance of having drawn his first nourishment from that sacred source  if said the wit who sawor believed he sawa fallacy lurking under the suggestion a child brought up by hand were to see a wooden spoon he would in that case experience the same emotionsit is one of thackerays peculiar excellencies that he almost always ridicules ab intra an absurdity is stated by him u the quietest and gravest manner as if he were himself a believer in it like others andenforced by such means of selfaccumulation as leave it tounmitigated contempt his irony of this kind  perfect  but it is a weapon which he uses ar too exclusively he has shown himself as we nave said a satirist but not an artist with himself we exclaim  o brother wearers of gotley are there not moments when one grows c of grinning and tumbling and the jingling of bells there is nothing so sad as a constant miue laughter becomes wearisome when too much prolonged  for it is then a sort of hlaskeny against the divine beauty which is in life mr thackeray grows serious and pathetic at tunesbut almost as if he were ashamed of it like a man caught in tears at the theatre it is one weakness of the satirist that he is commonly afraid of the ridicule of others we have said that mr thackeray is a satirist not an artistand from that characteristic may be deduced many of his deficiencies for instance the reader of  vanity fair will have observed that we have in it nothing but scenes and sketchesonly glimpses not views there is constant succession of description but no development of story the passions are taken at their culminating point not exhibited in the process of growth the incidents are seldom transacted before our eyes but each is taken as a fait accompli nor is there anything like proportion kept the writer opens a chapter and his pen runs on easily fed by a full and observant mindbut recording the suggestions ofthe moment rather than building up the various portions of an edifice already planned and in which each part has its due significance mr thackeray is deficient too in passion a deficiency that sits lightly on a satirist but is serious in a writer of fiction he has no command over this qualityapparently but little knowledge of it the curtain of the tragedy of life has seldom risen before him or he has looked on its representations with an incurious eye altogether one may say that mr thackeray has not very curiously or patiently observed moral phenomena life he has seen both at home and abroad and he has reflected on what he has seen we feel that he is painting after nature  and this conviction it is which makes his work so delightful nothing is permanently interesting but truth as a consequence of mr thackerays satirical tendency may be noted the prodigality of vice and folly to be found in his pagesand which affords no true representation of human nature but only the exaggeration of a feature it has been made a serious reproach against this writer that he has arrived at such a pitch of misanthropy or doubt as to think with chamfort that anhonestman is a variety ofthe human species it is not the first time that this great defect of art has been conspicuous in the writings of mr thackeray the  snob papers undertaken to expose the folly of a class gradually expanded under the writers satiric heat till they found snobbery every where and marked every body for a snob good instincts and impulses came under the ridicule which should have branded a folly or a vice and long ere the  papers came to a close all feeling of sincerity was gone the author who began with a moral was content at last to get a laughand ruined his moral by laughing in holy places so with this hook the writer began no doubt with the wholesome intention of lashing the vices and follies of vanity fair in a more restrictive senseregarded as one of the social phases but gradually all the districts of society are swept into his vanity fair  and there is nothing good in it this is false and unwholesome teaching what a mass of scoundrels blacklegs fools and humbugs mr thackeray has crowded together there is scarcely a good or estimable person in the book and as little of affection as of virtue even the heroine ameliawith whom the writer seems to have been somewhat enamoured a feeling of which he is likely to have the monopolyis thoroughly selfish as well as silly the one fine exception is major dobbina sketch not unworthy of the hand that drew  my uncle toby as we have said mr thackerays humour is peculiarly his own he never frames and glazes an idea the simplest words and in the simplest manner are used to bring out his meaning and everything seems to flow from him as water from a rock we may add that when he chooses to be pathetic a quality of the same kind gives wonderful effect to his pathos how beautiful is the scene in which amelia has resolved at length to part from her child   one day when things had come to a very bad passwhen the creditors were pressing the mother in hysteric grief the father in more than usual gloom the inmates of the family avoiding each other each secretly oppressed with his private unhappiness and notion of wrongthe father and daughter happened to be left alone together and amelia thought to comfort her father by telling him what she had done she had written to josephan answer must come in three or four months he was always generous though careless he could not refuse when he knew how straightened were the circumstances of his parents then the poor old gentleman revealed the whole truth to herthat his son was still paying the annuity which his own imprudence had flung away he had not dared to tell it sooner he thought amelias ghastly and terrified look when with a trembling miserable voice he made the confession conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment ah said he with quivering lips and turning away you despise your old father nowo papa it is not that amelia cried out falling on his neck and kissing him many times  you are always good and kind you did it for the best it is not for the moneyit iso my god my god  have mercy upon me and give me strength to bear this trial and she kissed him again wildly and went away still the father did not know what that explanation meant and the burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him it was that she was conquered the sentence was passed the child must go from her to othersto forget her her heart and her treasureber joy hope love worshipher god almost she must give him up and thenand then she would go to george and they would watch over the child and wait for him until he came to them in heaven she put on her bonnet scarcely knowing what she did and went out to walk in the lanes by which george used to come back from school and where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy it was may a half holiday the leaves were all coming out the weather was brilliant the boy came running to ber flushed with health singing bis bundle of schoolbooks hanging by a thong there lie was both her arms were round him no it was impossible they could not be going to part  what is the matter mother said ho you look very pale nothing my child she said and stooped down and kissed him that night amelia made the boy read the story of samuel to her and how hannah his mother having weaned him brought him to eli the high priest to minister before the lord and he read the song of gratitude which hannah sang and which says  who it is who maketh poor and maketh rich and bringeth low and exaltethbow the poor shall be raised up out of the dust aud how in his own might no man shall be strong then he read how samuels mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up to offer the yearly sacrifice and then in her sweet simple way georges mother made commentaries to the boy upon this affecting story how hannah though she loved her son so much yet gave bim up because of her vow and how she must always have thought of bim as she sat at home far away making the little coat and samuel she was sure never forgot his mother and how happy she must have been as the time came and the years pass away very quick when she should see her boy and how good and wise he had grown this little sermon she spoke with a gentle solemn voice and dry eyes until she came to the account of their meetingthen the discourse broke off suddenly the tender heart overflowed and taking the boy to her breast she rocked him in her arms and wept silently over bim in a sainted agony of tears we must give the parting too what a profound and cruel touch is that childlike selfishness with which georgy receives the announcement of the separation  george was kept from school the next day and saw his aunt amelia left them alone together and went to her room she was trying the separation  as that poor gentle lady jane grey felt the edge of the axe that was to come down and sever her slender life days were passed in parleys visita preparations the widow broke the matter to georgy with great caution she looked to see him very much affected by the intelligence he was rather elated than otherwise and the poor woman turned sadly away he bragged about the news that day to the boys at school told them how he was going to live with his grandpapa his fathers father not the one who comes here sometimes and that he would bo very rich and have a carriage and a pony and go to a much finer school and when he was rich he would buy leaders pencilcase and pay the tart woman the boy was the image of his tallier as his fond mother thought indeed i have no heart on account of our dear amelias sake to go through the story of georges last days at home at last the day came the carriage drove up the little humble packets containing tokens of love and remembrance were read and disposed in the hali long sincegeorge was in his new suit for which the tailor had come previously to measure him he had sprung up with the sun and put on the new clothes his mother hearing him from the room close by in which she had been lying in speechless grief and watching days before she had been making preparations for the end  purchasing little stores for the boys usc marking his books and linen talking with him and preparing him for the changofondly fancying that he needed preparation so that he had change what cared he  he was longing for it by a thousand cager declarations as to what he would do when he went to live with his grandfather he had hown the poor widow how little the idea of parting had cast him down  he would come and see his mamma often on the ponyhe said he would come and fetch her in thc carriage they would drive in the park and she should have everything she wanted the poor mother was fain to content herself with these selfish demonstrations of attachment and tried to convince herself how sincerely her son loved her he must love her all children were so a little anxious for novelty andno not selfish but selfwilled her child must have his enjoyments and ambition in the world she herself by her own selfishness and imprudent love for him had denied him his just rights and pleasures hitherto the character of becky is amongst the finest creations of modern fiction she is perfectly unlike any other clever heartless woman yet drawn with great art she is made rather selfish than wickedthough the excess of the selfishness rises to the force and has the effect of wickedness profound immorality is made to seem consistent with unfailing good humour becky has neither affections nor passions nor principles she uses men as chessmenand is not checkmated at last it is very strange that the reader has a sort of liking for her in spite of his better knowledge the fact is the author has contrived in a surprising way to represent not only beckys mind but her manner we are in some sort under her spellas rawdon was to us she is almost as lively entertaining and goodhumoured as she was to those amongst whom she lived like lord steyne we may see through her yet covet her society her equability of temper is a nice touch it belongs to the physiology of such a character they who have no affections and no principles can be wounded only in their selflove and may obtain the character of being goodtemperea at the cheapest possible cost the consistency of this remarkable character is maintained to the last how full yet brief graphic and suggestiveis the microscopic view of her life after her separation from her husband  our darling beckys first flight was not very far she perched upon the french coast at boulogne that refuge of so much exiled english innocence and there lived in rather a genteel widowed manner with a femme de chamber and a couple of rooms at an hotel she dined at the table dhote where people thought lier very pleasant and whete she entertained her neighbours by stories of her brother sir pitt and her great london acquaintance talking that easy fashionable slipslop which has so much effect upon certain folks of small breeding she passed with many of them for a person of importance she gave little teaparties in her private room and shared in the innocent amusements ofthe placein seabathing nnd in jaunts of open carriages in strolls on the sands and in visits to the play mrs burjoice the printers lady who was boarding with her family at the hotel for the summer anil to whom her burjoice came of n saturday and sunday voted her charming until that little rogue of a burjoice began to pay her too much attention but there was nothing in the story only that becky was always affable easy and goodnaturedand with men especially numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the season and becky hud plenty of opportunities of rinding out by the behaviour of her acquaintances of the great london world the opinion of  society as regarded her conduct one day it was lady partlet and her daughters whom becky confronted as she was walking modestly on boulogne pier the clitfs of albion shining in the distance across the deep blue sea lady partlet marshalled all her daughters round her with a sweep of her parasol and retreated from the pier darting savage glances nt poor little becky who stood alone there on another day the packet came in it had been blowing fresh and it always suited beckys humour to see the droll and woebegono faces of the people ns they emerged from the boat lady slingstone happened to bu on board this day her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her carriage and was greatly exhausted anti scarcely fit to walk up the plank from the ship to the pier but all her energies rallied the instant she saw becky smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet and giving her a glance of scorn such as would have shrivelled up most women she walked into the custom house quite unsupported becky only laughed but i dont think she liked it she felt sho was alone quite alone  and the farotf shining cliffs of england were impassable to her the behaviour of the men had undergone too i dont know what change grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity that was not

kindness and fidelity  his neverceasing obedience  bis good humour  his bravery and courage very likely she cried for she was particularly lively and had put on a little extra rouge when she came down to dinner she rouged regular now andand her maid got cognac for her besides that which was charged in the hotel bill perhaps the insults of the men were not however so intolerable to her as the sympathy of certain women mrs crackenbury and mrs washington white passed through boulogne on their way to switzerland the party were protected by colonel hornby young beaumoris and of course old crackenbury and mrs whites little girl they did not avoid her they giggled cackled tattled condoled consoled and patronised her until they drove her almost wild with rage to bo patronised by them  she thought as they went away simpering after kissing her and she heard beaumoriss laugh ringing on the stair and knew quite well how to interpret his hilarity it was after this visit that becky who had paid ber weekly bills becky who had made herself agreeable to everybody in the house who smiled at the landlady called the waiters  monsieurand paid the chambermaids in polhen nnd apologies what far more than compensated ft little niggardliness in point of money of which bea never was free that becky we sav received  notice to quit from the landlord who had been told by some one that she was quite an unfit person s have at his hotel where english ladies would not sit down with lier and she was forced to fly  lodgings of which the dullness and solitude were most wearisome to her still she held up in sdj of these rebuffs and tried to make a character for herself and conquer scandal she went to church very regularly and sang louder than nnvbody there she took up the cause of the widows of the shin wrecked fishermen and gave work and drawing fo the quashyboo mission  she subscribed to the assembly and wouldnt waltz in a word she did everything that was respectable and that is why we dwell upon this part of her career with more fondness than upon subsequent parts of her history which are not so pleasant she saw people avoiding her and still laboriously smiled upon them you never could suppose from her countenancewhat pangs of humiliation she might be enduring inwardly her history was after all a mystery parties were divided about her some people who took the trouble to busy themselves in the matter said that she was the criminal whilst others vowed that she wits as innocent as a lamb and that her odious husband was in fault she won over a good many by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting the most frantic grief when his name was mentioned or she saw anybody like him she gained good mrs alderneys heart in that way who was rather the queen of british boulogne and gave the most dinners and balls of all the residents there by weeping when muster alderney came from dr swishtail academy to pass his holidays with his mother  he and her rawdon were of the same age and io like becky said in a voice choking with agony whereas there was five years difference between the boys ages nnd no more likeness between them than between my respected reader and his humble servant wenham when ho was going abroad on his way to kissengen to join lord steyne enlightened mrs alderney on this point and told her how he was much more able to describe little rawdon than his mamma who notoriously hated him and never saw him how he was thirteen years old while little alderney was but nine fair while the other darling was darkin a word caused the lady in question to repent of her good humour whenever becky made a little circle for herself with incredible toils and labour somebody carno and swept it down rudely and she had all her work to begin over again it was very hard  very hard lonely and disheartening there was mrs newbright who took her up for some time attracted by the sweetness of her singing at church and by her proper views upon serious subjects concerning which in former days at queens crawley mrs becky had had a good deal of instructionwell she not only took tracts but she read them she worked flannel petticoats for the quashybooscotton nightcaps for the coconut indianspainted handscreens for the conversion of the pope and the jewssate under mr rowls on wednesdays mr huggleton on thursdays attended two sunday services at church besides mr bawler the darbyite in the evening and all in vain mrs newbright had occasion to correspond with the countess of southdown about the warmingpan fund for the feejee islanders for the management of which admirable charity both these ladies formed part of a female committee and having mentioned her sweet friend mrs rawdon crawley the dowager countess wrote back such a letter regarding becky with such particulars hints facts falsehoods and general comminations that intimacy between airs newbright and mrs crawley ceased forthwith  and all the serious world of tours where this misfortune took place immediately parted company with the reprobate those who know the english colonies abroad know that we carry with us our pride pills prejudices harveysauces cayennepepper and

consummate truth this heavy dragoon is made to feel his insignificance by the side of his clever little wife but how completely paralysed the adroit little woman is when she stands guilty before her husbandhow silently she obeys him who has hitherto obeyed herhow she feels that her arts are powerless against his passion brute strength long led by mental cunning here reasserts its empire and is undisputed the whole scene is most masterly jos sedley is rather a failure nor is he consistently drawn we are introduced to him as a roan painfully shy nervous and stupid but ti the story proceeds he drops his shyness and retains only the gluttony and stupidity of his former self meant as a decidedly comic character he creates but little mirthgeorge osborne the vain and foolish young officer is capitally drawn lord steyne is one of those telling exaggerations which make people exclaim how true when their acquaintance with lords is confined to fashionable novels though overdone however it is an exaggeration byamaster and the descriptions of gaunt house and its inmates transcend all previous efforts in that style old miss crawley is capital her selfishness her sagacity her terrors in ill health ber triumph over the meanness which surrounds her and which she laughs at and profits by are vividly presented yet by the simplest strokes here is a sentence pregnant with meaning and very characteristic of the author picture to yourself oh fair young reader a worldly selfish graceless thankless religionless old woman writhing in pain and fear and without her wig picture her to yourself and ere you be old learn to love and pray  mrs odowd must not be forgotten the gallant woman has won the hearts of her regiment and of all her readers how true homely affectionate and wise is the description of her packing up the majors traps and preparing his coffee for him on the eve of waterloo the vividness with which the whole of the scenes at brussels stand out before the eye is marvellous when we reflect that the author is not describing the scenes which he himself witnessed but only painting after the descriptions of others they imply a fine faculty for historical romance nor is it only in this more elaborate painting that mr thackeray has exhibited a constant mastery in the present book the instances are abundant of meaning conveyed and intensified by a single line of illustration take only one where amelia reads over georges letters she read them overas if she did not know them by heart already  but she could not part with them that effort was too much for her she placed them back in her bosom againas you have seen a woman nurse a child that is dead our extracts though sparing will suffice to warrant the terms in which we have spoken of vanity fair its great excellence however cannot be tested hy extracts the charm of the work pervades itand is not gathered up into separate bits knowledge of life good humoured satire penetration into motive power of

B3600,"['6713689', '8584519']",  far from thc madding crowd by thomas hardy london smith elder  co 1874 far from the madding crowd is so clever a novel so original in atmosphere and in character that its brilliant qualities are likely to neutralise the glare of its equally prominent faults the writer has the advantage of dealing with an almost untouched side of english life his scene is laid somewhere in the country of mr freemans favourite seaxsaetas in a remote agricultural and pastoral district of southwestern england among peasants who look on bath as a distant and splendid metropolis it is likely that much of the old country existence lives on undisturbed the country folk in the story have not heard of strikes or of mr arch they have to all appearance plenty to eat and warm clothes to wear and when the sheep are shorn in the ancient barn of weatherbury the scene is one that shakespeare or that chaucer might have watched this immobile rural existence is what the novelist has to paint  in comparison with cities he says weatherbury was immutable the citizens then is the rustics now in london twenty or thirty years ago are old times in paris ten years or five in weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present and nothing hiss than a century set a mark on its face or tone five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter the embroidery of a smockfrock by the breadth of a hair ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase in these nooks the busy out aiders ancient times are only old his old times are still new his present is futurity no condition of society could supply though writer who knows it well with a more promising ground for his story the old and the new must meet here and there with curious surprises and our world may find itself face to face with the quaint conceited rustics of shakespeares plays such a story might be written as george sand has often told of the vallee noire sober characters and simple might appear in the foreground of scenes exquisitely quiet and harmonious in our opinion the writer of far from the madding crowd has only partially succeeded in making the best of his theme and though his failure is more valuable than i many successes he has been misled by attempting too much in his way of looking at his subject he rather resembles george eliot than george sand he contemplates his shepherds and rural people with the eye of a philosopher who understands all about them though he is not of them and who can express their dim efforts at rendering what they think and feel in language like that of mr herbert spencer it is this way of writing and thinking that gives though book its peculiar tone the author is telling clever people about unlettered people and he adopts a sort of patronising voice in which there are echoes now of george eliot and now of george meredith thus there aro passages where the manner and the matter jar and are out of keeping there are three circles of interest in this storyfirst the rural surroundings the effects of weather and atmosphere the labours of beasts and men as the lambing of sheep and such mild struggles with natures storms and rains as m victor hugo would scarcely find dramatic enough for his tremendous canvas next there are the minor charactersa sort of chorus of agricultural labourers very ready with advice very helpless and very much taken up with themselves as was the way with the ancient chorus last there are the main persons of the dramathe people in whose passions and adventures the interest ought to centre of these three component parts of the tale the first may bo pronounced nearly perfect and worthy of all praise we might instance the description of norcombe hill by starlight in the beginning of the second chapter as an original and admirable treatment of natureof nature which is more and more tending to become a main interest in our modern fiction we prefer to quote the enumeration of the signs by which the hero detected the approach of a storm because the quotation includes the sheep whose birth and death in this tale are narrated with great minuteness  the sheep were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes and the first peculiarity observable was that on the sudden appearance of oaks head over the fence they did not stir or run away they had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man but this was not the most noteworthy feature they were all grouped in such a way that their tails without a single exception were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened there was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar to which thc clump of furze bushes stood in the relation of the wearers neck  this was enough to reestablish him in his previous opinion he knew now that he was right and troy was wrong every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change but two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions apparently there was to be a thunderstorm and afterwards a cold continuous rain the creeping things seemed to know all about the latter rain but little of the interpolated thunderstorm while the sheep knew all about the thunderstorm and nothing of the latter rain when the thunderstorm bursts it is described with much pictorial effect and is a quite disagreeable enough trial to oak the english gilliat and contender with nature coming from though scenery to the chorus we are a good deal puzzled few men know the agricultural labourer at home and it is possible that ho is what mr hardy describes him the labourers are all humourists in their way which is a very dreary and depressing way odd scraps of a kind of rural euphuism misapplications of scripture and fragments of modern mechanical wit are stirred up into a queer mixture which makes the talk of henery fray cainy ball jan coggan and especially of that preeminent bore joseph poorgrass do labourers really converse like this  i look round upon life quite promiscous do you conceive me neighbours  my words though made as simple as i can nmy be rather deep tor some heads   oh yes henery we quite conceive ye  a strange old piece goodmenwhirled about from here to yonder as if i were nothing worth a little warped too but i have my depths ha and even my great depths i might close with a certain shepherd brain to brain but no oh no hero is another specimen of rural speech   for a drunk of really a noble class and on the highest principles that brought you no nearer to the dark man than you were afore you began there was none like these in farmer everdenes kitchen not a single damn allowed no not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there would have been a great relief to a merry soul   true said the maltster  nature requires her swearing at the regular times or shes not herself and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life and so on shepherds may talk in this way we hope not but if they do it is a revelation and if they dont it is nonsense and not very amusing nonsense leaving the servants and coming to their master and mistress we cannot say that wo are greatly fascinated with the persons or much concerned in their fortunes nothing could be more true or more careful than the study of troy the handsome sergeant with his half education his selfishness his love which he only finds out to be something like true love under the influence of remorse when the soldier erects a costly tomb to the woman whose heart he has broken and plants flowers on her grave in such a way as to wound to the quick the woman he has married we recognise an insight and a touch like that of flaubert but we cannot easily pardon bathsheba the heroine for losing her heart to troys flattery and to the glitter of his brass and scarlet indeed we have some difficulty in being much moved by bathshebas character and mischances when wo first see her she is stealing a look at herself in a mirror unconscious of the presence of young farmer oak when she hears that oak has asked her aunt for leave to court her and has been discouraged she runs after the exemplary man and explains that she is heart free then she sends a valentine with a seal marry me to farmer boldwood and so fascinates that apparently calm but really passionate rustic meanwhile oak fails as a farmer and bathsheba having become a farmer in ber own right takes him on as shepherd and has  curiously confidential passages with him at last the gay sergeant fixes her fancy with a display of swordsmanship and sho drives alone at night to bath and is married to him we feel inclined to say to her as mr buckstone does to galatea in the play  youre sure its innocence   the young ladys misfortunes deepen as troy spends her money and takes to drinking thero is a very powerful and strange scene between them when she opens the coffin of her dead rival fanny robin and her husband kisses the lips of the corpse and tells his wife that he only loved the dead it is a situation worthy of the drama of webster or of ford and wild as it is is lcd up to in a perfectly natural way this part of the tale including fanny robins terrible walk to her rest in the workhouse is ominently tragic and is not improved by the commonplace tragedy of the denouement we leave bathsheba wedded to the worthy oak a capital overseer and a husband who may be trusted we hope the babies were  put in the papers every man jack of them as mr oak promised when ho wooed bathsheba is so seldom on though level that her troubles with her husband raise her to that wc feel she does not decline on oak and have no sense of her as wasting her sweetness it is unlikely that even her remorso for having tempted boldwood would lead her into her foolish latter relations with such a man and on the whole we cannot look on bathsheba as a firmly designed character in spite of this want of success and of incongruities of tone tyar from the madding crowd displays undeniable talent which has scarcely as yet found its best and easiest and most natural expression in taking leave of an interesting provoking and clever story we must say a word in praise of though graceful illustrations a lang  far from the maddlng crowd far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy author of  a pair of blue eyes smith elder and co without making minute comparisons between mr hardy and any of his contemporary novelists let it suffice to say that this last work of his at once lifts his name above the crowd and gives him a position among the eminent few which it rests with himself to confirm or to diminish mr hardy is not a novelist to whom the exercise of his art is a bywork or a recreation it is clear that he has given his best energies to its service and has worked with faithful and patient zeal for his reward it is pleasing to meet with work that is so obviously the outcome of high aims and one should not be grudging in expressing ones conviction of the artists thorough success far from the madding crowd is not mr hardys first novel but it is so much more mature and powerful in every way than his earlier efforts that in them he seems rather to have been exercising himself with a view to obtaining a command of his materials this is particularly true of under the greenwood tree published some two years ago which the author called  a rural painting of the dutch school and in which he depicted rural life in an english county with the most loving minuteness and intimate fidelity of detail  a pair of blue eyes mr hardys next effort was not so exclusively pictorial it was a study of a more tragic kind with more complex characters and a more stirring plot but the evolution was none the less deliberate and every situation was worked out with the same painstaking and searching method both under the greenwood tree and a pair of blue eyes are very remarkable novels which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation and pictorial and narrative power of the writer but far from the madding crowd is not only an advance upon them in freedom and firmness of handling but it excels them also in concentration of interest and in spacious breadth and solid truth of proportion when the first chapters of  far from the madding crowd appeared in the cornthill magazbine a supposition was started that this must be a new novel by george eliot and the point was very generally discussed indeed if those chapters stood by themselves as a fragment of unknown authorship no conjecture could be more plausible they deal with the kind of life that george eliot has more than once chosen to describe to which in fact she has almost acquired a prescriptive right and the opening description of farmer oak is a portrait very much in her manner if the critic cared to go into minute corroborations of such distinguished parentage he would find them in the incidents of bathshebas unpacking the mirror and taking a survey of her beauty while waiting on the top of the cart and her higgling over twopence with the tollkeeper these little incidents have a delicate spice of malicious truth to nature which one often finds in george eliots pictures at the same time if we had read mr hardys previous novels we need have had no difficulty in tracing the authorship of  far from the madding crowd for mr hardys style is his own and sufficiently distinctive to be easily recognised one might mistake a detached portion of his work for george eliots but when it is viewed as a whole it has a good many striking points of difference mr hardy is not such a master of language as george eliot his style has not the same freshness nor the same eloquence and momentum and this difference of style goes along with a more deeplyseated difference of matter mr hardy is much less of a preacher than george eliot his interests are more exclusively dramatic he is absorbed in delineating character and tracing the workings of passion by minute touches and does not withdraw from his dramatic work to deliver his soul of pentup reflections with all george eliots impartiality towards her creations and her desire to represent each ones life truly as it is nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice the heart of the preacher is to be detected in her choice of subjects her characters derive a large part of their interest from their opinions and views of life now the drama in mr hardys novels is in no sense a warfare of opinions or ideas it is a warfare of persons persons moved by the primaeval motives of love and jealousy far from the madding crowd is concerned with no deeper mysteries than womens hearts and how they are lost and won its story lies in country fields and farmhouses and occupies itself solely with the secular and social life of the inhabitants whether we regard this as a merit or a defect or a matter of indifference depends entirely on our conceptions of art and its functions but if we hold no dogma concern  ing the functions of art and approach mr hardys novel simply as a drama willing to believe that it need not be frivolous because it has no great lesson to teach it is impossible not to recognise the novelists power the plot of far from the madding crowd is of the simplest kind mr hardys art does not lie in the multiplication and complication of incidents but in the searching and complete way in which he traces the effect of each incident upon the thoughts and feelings of his personages the central figure all through is bathsheba everdenea marvellously welldrawn and difficult heroine who unites ha iunlits of her biblical namesake to an inner nature  is     i ius maut vl inne fak curiously compounded of shrewdness strongmined irankness and courage and decorous imperious wayward womanliness the two little incidents that occur on her first introduction to us her satisfied selfinspection in the mirror and her obstinate refusal to give the toilkeeper what he askedat once give us the clue to two sides of her character the novel may be viewed as a history of a struggle between impulsive womanliness and worldly good sense all bathshebas troubles coming from her beauty and consequent waywardness and vanity and the rectification coming from the homelier side when we first see her she is on her way to live with an aunt in whose neighbourhood lives a shepherd farmer named gabriel oak oak was a sturdy capable fellow neither ugly nor particularly welllooking who had raised himself by thrift sobriety and superior knowledge of his work from being a common shepherd to having a farm of his own he naturally fell in love with bathsheba and the account of h1i drein before going througlh the momentous ceremony of making a

B2967,['4373322'],  wives and daughters some such gentle assuagement of sorrow as many have felt on looking at the face of a beloved one for the last time and noting the perfected beauty that has come upon it with the coming of death will be felt by those who have known and loved the authoress of this book in recognising the grace of its design and the completeness of its execution much as literature lose by losing mrs gaskell in the ripenes of her power regret in tempered by the reflection that her eighteen years work has been crowned by three books at least that will rank as masterpiecescousin phillis sylvias lovers and wives and daughters it is too early to estimate the exact value of these stories but it is certainly not too much to say of them at onceas the editor of the cornhill magazine says in his concluding  wives and daughters an everyday story by mrm gukell with eighteen ro by george du a two volwe london 8uut remarks on the book now before usthat they are  some of the truest and purest works of fiction in the language in many respects they stand alone in no other works of fiction since those of mliss austen has the individuality of the writer been so completely sunk in that of the characters she has portrayed such an achievement implies extraordinary creative faculty and something of the greatness of the measure in which it was possessed by mrs gaskell may be recounised by comparing any of her later works with the best of those of miss austen both novelists have dealt with everyday life its people and its incidents but with an imnmense difference of perceptive power the pictures drawn by the authoress of  sense and sensibility  are clear fresh reliable as the finest photographs those of mrs gaskell as it seems to us more resemble in largeness of treatment the finest paintings of meissonnier on this account we are inclined to think that when the time has come for determining the place of her works on the list of english masterpieces of fiction wives and daughters will be found to rank more nearly with the adam bede of george eliot than with any of the novels of miss austen it is a work above and beyond the reach of critical analysis absolutely faultless it is not but such faults as there are in it appear so insignificant when its great and manifest excellencies are taken into account as not to be worthy of serious notice what is the use of objecting to one of the most exquisitely true and beautiful characters ever drawn by a novelist that she is too good  a lover might as reasonably object to the white perfection of his ladys brow or desire the blemish of a mole or a freckle on her cheek the spotless goodness of molly gibson has nothing in common with such goodness as the authoress of  christians mistake and  a noble life delights to paint molly gibson is good because she is good not merely because mrs goskell has chosen to make her so there are characters enough with faults in wives and daughters  but the mind which created them was too wise to think of exaggerating either the goodness or the badness in them a long way within the extremes of milkandwater saintliness and brimstone sinfulness she had found a great deal of human nature and she was content to reproduce it as she found itneither better nor worse we have no puny preaching about good and evil no nurserytale moral in wives and daughters  but instead a wonderful exhibition of human character an admirable display of intuitive knowledge of human action thought and feeling story there is hardly any in the sense of plot yet there is not an incident in the whole book that is not made as interesting as an event in an ordinary sensation novel by force of strongly awakened sympathy as in ordinary life the experiences of each days existence to each character is a story rounded and complete so far as it goes how endlessly varied and deeply interesting we learn when novelists like mrs gaskell reproduce it of the characters in wives and daughters we are made to know the dailycontinued story more thoroughly than we are likely to know the story even of our own daily lives for few of us ever get so comprehensive a view of our own characters as mrs gaskell gives of those of the personages of her drama no matter how difficult the characterization may be one great charm of her work indeed is the apparent ease with which it has been accomplished the men and women whom she has set before us might be real presences only it is certain that in such a case they would lack the exquisitely perfect contour with whichseenlingly without effortshe has reproduced them in her book they cannot be described apart from the persons and events by which they are influenced to say that cynthiathe most remarkable character of allis a coquette is to convey no idea of the cynthia drawn with such masterful completeness by mrs gaskell she is the child of her mother and her character requires to be studied in conjunction with that of her mother to be thoroughly appreciated so it is throughout the story none of the characters introduced lead lives apart from their fellowcreatures and it is by the faithful representation of their conduct when brought into contact with others that their characters are portrayed few books in the english language or perhaps in any language exhibit such an extraordinary assemblage of perfectly represented individualities the story of  wives and daughters was not finished by the authoress  what promised to be the crowning work of a life says the editor of the cornbill magazine in which periodical the novel first appeared  is a memorial of death a few days longer and it would have been a triumphal column crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers now it is another sort of columnone of thosie sad white pillars which stand broken in a churchyard enough of the authoresss intention was known h wever to suggest what would have been the end of the story had she happily lived to finish it only one chapter was wanting to complete her design even without it her work is beautifully proportioned with it it would have been artistically perfect we turn reluctantly to the subject of the socalled illustrations of this charming book we should have been heartily glad if the publishers bad not thought it worth while to reproduce the eighteen caricatures which disfigured the pages of the cornhill and doubly disfigure those of the two volumes now before us that such examples of all that is perverse in taste can give any satisfaction to the readers of  wives and daughters we do not believe to our mind they illustrate nothing but the egotism of one of a small band of artists whose vocation appears to be to bring the admirable art of woodengraving woodcutting has latterly we believe been adopted as the more correct description into contempt,social
B8156,"['9429962', '4364890']",  the small house at allington new novels by anthony trollope with illustrations smith elder  co the small house at allington has already been as thronged with interested visitors as strawberry hill the ten days before the sale nearly everybody has heard of it most people have read it and now that it has come before the public complete in two beautiful volumes with mr millaiss illustrations retained those who have possessed their soul in patience until it should be completed will be able to reap their reward whilst those who have taken it in monthly fractions will go over the ground again with something of regret recognising the old landmarks where the story broke off leaving them hungry and impatient at the months pause that must intervene before the next instalment certainly if the dietary rule  to rise from table with an appetite holds good for the reading of novels the small house at allington has strenuously enforced it and many readers at the moment would have rashly offered to forfeit three weeks in the month if they might thus have learned the progress of the story a little further ahead it is characteristic of this story that the characters are all living human beings and there has been as much speculation whether lily dale would marry johnny eames as about any marriage on the tapis as the morning pott phrases it in any town or village in great britain readers have made it a personal question and there have been vehement discussions as to the probability of her forgiving adolphus crosbie and being happy with him at last after he had been punished sufficiently for the sake of the moral and had profited by his sufferings so as to come to his right mind many hoped that he would break loose from his slavery to lady alexandrina and her family before the weddingday and go back to his lawful queen mr trollope has shown great skill in the management of the character of adolphus crosbie he has kept the reader in charity with him in spite of all hus sins even his faithlessness to lily is made so natural that the candid reader cannot feel himself a pharisee and hug himself with complacency that he is not even like adolphus crosbie the temptation to which he yielded was so suited to his weakness and the point of view from which he saw things is given so fairly that it is impossible not to understand how he fell from his own steadfastness under the enchantments of de courcy castle there is no false excuse made for him no palliation offered except the truth which appeals to each  consider thyself lest thou also be tempted the whole of that passage of life in de courcy castle under the high pressure got up for those distinguished visitors lady dumbello and mr plantagenet palliser is admirably true as a sketch of manners and customs in a great house of that class and true to the human nature of the different characters concerned in the story the gradual development of crosbies mistake the recoil upon himself the retribution which arises from the nature of things and not from any machinery of human justice are vt ry subtly and skilfully indicated it shows too what one is glad to have shownthe genuine human conscience that lives and moves under all the apparent selfish indifference of society to matters not immediately personal the drawing of the characters in  the small house at allington is vigorous and lifelike the scene of lord de guest in his encounter with the bull the familyscenes at the gazebees house in st johns wood the buying of carpets and the other pre matrimonial arrangements are very clever the scenes at lilys home with mrs dale the squire and the two young ladies are good but the reader regards them with respect rather than with lively interest whilst the scenes at the boardinghouse are vulgar and absolutely unpleasant except for poor mrs roper there cannot be the smallest interest the secret of this falling off is that in the picture of life in burton crescent mr trollope has put no touches of kindly feeling like those with which he redeems the poor old worldly illused countess and even mitigates ones detestation of lady alexandrina by showing the very damp and dreary home to which she was brought as for johnny eames himself he is rather a bore no woman could ever feel the smallest interest in him unless it were a kind elderly woman like lady julia de guest his entanglement with amelia roper is fatal to all his pretensions as a hero and he behaves as ill to her as he knows how mr trollope feels it necessary to apologise for two kisses bestowed on that young lady but they are the only redeeming traits in the whole affair with all his faults the readers sympathy is with crosbie he goes through his bad business with lady alexandrina in a dignified manner accepting the consequences of his own fault with patience and a manly endeavour to make the best of things the story cannot be considered as concluded in the interest of a wide circle of readers we demand with emphasis of mr trollope that he tell us the further fortunes of the characters in the small house at allington the only chapter we do not wish to have reopened is that which concerns the inmates of burton crescent the illustrations are admirable for grace and truthfulness our favourite ia perhaps the one which illustrates crosbiea married life lally alexandrina sitting in discontent and crosbie standing in sorrowful dissatisfaction on the hearthrug tell a tale that needs no words to endorse it the scene on the bridge with lady julia and poor johnny eames is equally good the expression of kindness and sympathy thrown into the plain face of a middleaged woman gives it a positive beauty  the small iiouse at allington does anybody want to know where to find the best and nicest girls in all eiglandthe kindest the purest the pleasantest young ladies we have ever met wnith at least in a book  they used to live in the  small house at allington for aught we knowmr trollope knows better than we domiss lily dale who became mliss dale when her sister married the doctor at guestwicklives with her iiiother still and if there are no better and nobler men in the world than such as mr trollope has yet introduced to her acquaintance we would have this most loveable of women abide still in her maiden home crosbie adolphus crosbie of sebrifghts club is a selfish heartless coward a slave to the vain pursuit of social ambition johnny eames with all his frankness and good feeling is deficientt in strength of mind neither of these in our opinion could be worthy of lily dale no one shall ever call her his wife if mr trollope her guardian will follow our advice when he has to lead her forth again as we hope he means to do in his next novel of this series we like the custom which he has adopted on the precedent set by mr thackeray inl certain of his worksthat of bringring into a later story among its background figrures a few of the most interesting characters of a former tale there is the dear ol0 warden that pattern of christian mneekness and fidelity whom crosbie meets at the cathedral door of barchester towers  there is the pushing and prosperous archdeacon with his daughter lady dumbello a mere monument of fashionable elegance a superb and stately belgra via doll in the same manner if mr trollope pleases we shall again see lily dale she will make the most agreeable and estimable of old maids it will be such a comfort to her mother the widow that lily should remain at the small houseit will be such a blessing to the children of dr and mrs crofts at guestwickthat for mlrs dales sake and for bells sake whom we care to see happy as well as lily we would rather not have her married and carried away this is what comes of being an angel your friends will never let you go about your own business and the allington people cannot spare lily dale of course they were angry with mr crosbie when he broke his promise and nearly broke her heart but they must have secretly rejoiced tat she would stay in their village probably for life the rader cannot help sympathising with the allingtonian interest nor can he believe that it would have been happier for the girl herself to have got a fashionable london husband and a showy house in princess royalterrace tyburnia where 1ady alexandrina crbi tasted the bitter fruits of her conquest it is a question after all whether the nice people should invariably be married there is such a state as singlebleswoedsd for either sex and we hold with st paul that if it is a good thing to be married it is also a good thing not to be marred uies where the couple are personally so fitted to each other that neithe he nor she can live a good life apart this is not the case  lily dale though it may be so with one or other of her lovers and we do not like either of them well enough to give her sp to them the best man in the book is dr crofts who really deserves to of such a wife as bell but he is a lucky fellow indeed to obtaie lily for a bell swur and no worse motherinltaw than the widow dale the country doctor with his hard work and mode income who connects himself with this falitly of the smal house comes off with the happiest lot lord de guest is a fine specimen of the pi ount gede man and so is mr dale of the great house but lord do cots is a tyrant a miser and a blackguard as men of an6 cls sometimes be there is n typical earl though mr 1rofop x his former stories gave us a typical archdeacon and ot bw siastical officer tb smell hon a by acato troisg tw smith rider  co bglt we cannot say that he shows equal discrimination in every other instance his portraitiures of the uneducated vulgar and elypcially of the cockney whom mr dickens understands so ell are o10 better than a coarse caricature the people at mrs vpers boardinghouse are not to be compared with those at  lltodgerss or with some in mr thackerays earlier sketches tr tdloies humnour is of a fine and delicate quality the edge of whiich is sadly blunted when he attempts to use it upon such niriterrl as the lupexes and the cradells in the burtoncrescent chalpters of this novel or the shopnmen bagsmen andl london pelit ices of recent fiction and their female relatives his talent is that of quiet domestic comedy  when he ventures into farcietl exaggeration he always makes a mistake w1ith less ptwbr of syupaxthy than dickens he is unalle to interest his rctader in the feelings and fortunes of a lowlived sort of folk they sell wholly unattractive and contemptible when they fall iiito his hands as they did in the insolent writiigs of theodore hook tlhat mr trollope however entertains a sincere respect for thee working classes we will not doubt though he appears to dislike the families of small tradesmen whose meanness and ignorant vanity he sometimes labours to expose he had better let it alone  the time for satirising entire classes of english society has sone by the period of twentyfive or thirty yearrs since boz and titiiarsh began to write has vastly improved the average standard of intelligence and good manners in the lower middleclass population of this country servility and brutality are now the rare exception where once they are said to have been the rule we shall all please god  be ladies and gentlemen in the good time comling then shall we meet with honour and veracity behind the dignified counter and with the highest graces of chivalry on the cabstand where the gallant coachman putting his tennlvson into his pocket shall descend to open the door of his vehicle with a bow andl gather up his reins for an undisputed sixpenny fare in the meantime we could wish mr trollope with his liberal political opinions and kindly nature to refrain from drawing odious and uncoinely pictures of the little people of the cockney world but if we take away the burtoncrescent boardinghouse with its sordid habits and ridiculous airsif we keep this novelist to the domestic interiors of cultivated society in town and country or to the clubs of pallmall and the official parlours of whitehall where he is so thoroughly at homewhat a truth of portraiture what a pleasant and wellassured familiarity are there in mr trollopes sketches of the wluper middle class we do not hesitate to pronounce them better in some respects than those either of dickens or thackeray both of whom are undoubtedly superior to mr trollope in humour and wit in imagination land creative power we may turn for example to that entertaining first volume of the con 1 ill in which lovel the widower alternately with franiley parsonage delights and edifies the judicious reader in the former how much hearty fun how much sly and sarcastic wisdom how much dramatic force  but in the latter particularly in those connubial trials and counsels of the rev mark robarts and his wife how just an appreciation of the private household of a wellbred english family with its decorous virtues and the cares and duties of its social position to be strictly observed this indeed is mr trollopes peculiar theme he is far less successful when he seeks to delineate the boisterous and eccentric ways of that bohemian region where pendennis and warrington sojourned in their frank carnerade7ie upon town on the other hand mr trollope is wonderfully well acquainted with the little politics of the ladies their petty ambitions jealousies and tender affections and with their confidential talk by themselves the honest maidenly conversations between the two sisters bell and lily about their respective lovers contrasted with the combined maieuvres of lady de courcy and her daughters who want to secure a husband for alexandrina and their subsequent behaviour towards him when he cannot escape from the match are related with that profound knowledge of womankind in which mr trollope excels most other novelists of either the male or the female sex mrs dale too is a real true woman in her virtues and her faults a widow but forty years of age with a pair of children and left rather poor she has fancied it her duty to renounce all the pleasumres of life and shut herself up in a proud humility which gives offence to her late husbands brother who wishes to bestow a part of his own fortune upon the girls his nieces and to provide them a handsome establishment in the world the tenancy of the small house at allingtonnext to the jilting of lily dale by crosbie is the proper subject of the story mirs dale very naturally quarrels with herbrotherinlaw the squire whohas sought to usurp something like a paternal authority over miss bell with the benevolent design of compelling her to accept the heir to his estates the daughters like brave highspirited girls as they are taking their mothers prt and rebelling against the dictatorial patronage of their uncle support her resolution to quit the small house in which he has allowed her to live rentfree it is just one of those family dispates in which all parties have meant well but some pique or scruple has arisen and being exaggerated by a warm temper has set them at variance without any serious cause again we remark that mr trollope understands this sort of imbroglio which is of the very essence of light comedy more perfectly than it is under stood by most other writers of fiction he makes it in fact one of the principal motives in all his best stones he develops the deects of temper in all the transactions of domestic life temper tad woman are certainly two of the most important elements of the inodern novel and mr trollope is master of both we might perhaps regret the speed with which mr trollope produces new stories of very unequal merit if this last were not undeniably the best some of his tales it must be confessed have been quite unworthy of his geniusclumsy and unmeaning daubs upon the canvas of farcical fiction which requires a broader brush and more vigorous hand in the genteel comedy style of painting with finer strokes and on a smoother surface the novel we have now before us is a masterpiece of art enough has been said of the management of its characters and incidents to show the interest of the plot which should not be revealed prematurely to those who have the book still to read its greatest charm as we mentioned in the outset of this review lies in the two ldaughters of the widow dale who are the most natural young women the most attractive and the best behaved without a grain of either prudery or sentimentalism that any contemporary novelist has invented we begs that the author will go on to manufacture a great many more good and pleasant girls of the same quality and let us have the world stocked with them as early as possible to keep out the intolerable shedevils on the one hand and the impracticable shei saints on the other who swarm in the opposite ranks of the criminal and the  serious  novel there is something very beautiful in the simplest movements of poor lily after she is smitten with that cruel injury which has bruised the noble flower and cast it down in the garden of her home once only for a moment she has wept on her mothers bosom without a word of anger or complaint then she has lifted up her head and smiled through all her sorrow a longr illness has spared her the bitter condolence of her neighbours the appointed time

success other counties may have more in them of antiquarian and historical interest but no county included in this series can well have had more of interest got out of it than sir frederick treves has got out of dorset his pages are coloured with stories and little impressionistic wordpictures of dorsetshire worthies such as fielding the novelist william barnes the poet thomas mlasterman hardy nelsons captain old thomas fuller sir walter raleigh and to name no others thomas hardy who has put so much of dorset scenery and character into his novels and whose birthplace is pointed out at upper bockingham  an ancient cottage almost hidden from sight by the bushes of its old garden on the one hand and by the slope of the downs on the other also these pages are rich in rumours and remembrances of old wars and glamorous romantic happenings you have glimpses of king charles lying hidden at charmouth after the flight from worcester of monmouth fleeing along the secluded lanes after the rout of sedgemoor of the tragic progress of jeffreys and the bloody assize all the story of what dorset has been mingling with the story of what it is now and then sir frederick strikes a more personal note

at the general resurrection sturm takes an average of the yearly number of deaths in the town of hamburg from the date of the flood then by a bold speculation as to the date of the millennium he is able to continue his average to the end of time all that remains to be done is to express a proportion between the number of inhabitants of hamburg and the number of inhabitants of the world and sturm

then tragical subjects are said to be unfit for novels io choose a tragical subject is instantly pronounced to be a mark of illtaste an intricate plot is decried as impossible in real life carefully elaborated characters are held up as burlesques of human nature altogether it will be found that unfavourable criticisms generally point to the fact that the novelwriter has aimed at too much his plot or his characters or his speculations are overdone to say that the novel shall represent without overstepping the modesty of nature real human life is no longer a sufficient definition we are beginning to restrict it within very much narrower bounds some weeks ago we read in a critical journal a definition of what the novel should be which perhaps most of our modern school of critics would accept the writer stated that the only proper subjectmatter for the novel was the manners of the time in which it was written with great ingenuity he proceeded to show bow invaluable such books would be to historians of later ages who would thus have documents ready to their hands from which to cull those historical flowvers which so pleasantly bestrew their heavier pages  tom jones was cited as

humour of grim satire there could nqt be a better emblem of the book than this picture the pretty woeful face and claspd hands and jjtj pen4ant foot though this must be bloto4 id a godw breaker fashion squeezed into odd corners to give due prominence to that mountain of flounces are as the touches of real human nature which mr trollope has sparsely scattered on the ourskirts of his huge mass of conventionalism the story turns upon the inconveniences caused by a billacceptance and the disquiets arising from a loveaffair between a rich lord and the sister of his parsonfriend the bill with all its attendant expenses does not exceed a thousand pounds mark robarts who accepts it has an income of fifteen hundred ayear moreover all his friends are rich and are eager to lend him or to give him the thousand pounds in question one does not quite see why the affair should end in bailiffs taking possession of the parsonage furniture save that the exigencies of the story demand that little piece of excitement and that a moral is thus pointed how very much more shocking it is for a clergyman to suffer such misfortune than a layman with regard to the lovepassage between lucy robarts and lord lufton the only difficulty is that lady lufton his mother is supposed to be hostile to the match lucy will not accept ludovic until the consent of his mother is gained the mother never could or did refuse ludovic anything and so when he asks her to consent to the marriage she does consent why lucy should so often enter upon the scene woebegone in crinoline does not sufficiently appear there are the usual questions of conscience in the bookthe struggaes between duty and pleasure which lie at the bottom of all human stories here these take the form of casuistries as to what a parson ought to do or ought not to do how far may he act against the wishes of his patroness ought he to visit a bachelorduke does the presence of his bishop with him in questionable society render that society innoxious to himself  mtay he ride to the meet with a friend and if so may he cross one field after the hounds and if one how many more by how much its the wickedness of having anything to do with a bill increased by the party being clerical instead of lay we know of old that mr trollope takes a great interest in the clergy he tells us some where in this story with a somewhat grandiloquent gravity that his mission towards them extends only to consideration of their social relations not of their parish or diocese business we are glad his mission is so far limited in another place he hints that he has a scheme for the equalising of ecclesiastical incomes which scheme would seem to us to be an interference with ecclesiastical business in its most sacred point however we are spaed the unfolding of his scheme in  framley parsonage and so we have only to look at mr trollopes mission according to his own proclamationa mission to satirise gently the  social relations of the clerg  spare the rod and spoil the child quoth solomon and mr trollope when after mild castigation lie relegates this child to a fools cap and the corner performs these severities ostensibly with an eye to the chiids good we have often wondered w hat lie purposes in these constant inild satires we get always now in his hooks a flourish of trumpets when he is going to trot out a pearson isle has acbievel fame for that trick and it is always printed in his bills in the largest letters mr trollope in his famous act of parsonship is received with loud applause at the threshold of the arena and probably hisses would follow if hle substitutel any other performance for that timehonoured one tlhe lady  e art of his audience especially aplreciate this poking of fun at their pastors bishop proudie turned into an old panrtaloon is meat and drink to titem the wickedness of making fun of a bi8shop gives an exquisite edge to their delight we could understand that applause of this per forinance would make mr rollope repeat it also that habit would make limn repeat itit nust be very easy to do what he has been doing for half a life but when we find limn gravely hinting a high moral purpose in these exhibitions andl referring to his labours past and to come as giving him a claim to the gratitude of his countrymen we recur with double force to our old wondermentwhat is his object  is he a special enemy or a special friend to the parsons  did a parson ever injure him or are all his relations in the church does he think the parsons the only men worth warning in this wvicked age or does he think them the only men foolish enough and defenceless enough to he lashed by satire  or is it that he has some natural sympathy or antipathy anent them  some men are strongly affected by a cat or the singing i the nose of a bagpipes any how the parsons would be well rid of him that the question of parsondom in its social as well as its other relations is a difficult one and becoming more and more difficult yearly is pretty generally acknowledged but poking gentle fun at the manners and customs of the clergyman will not hell towards a settlement of the question it has long ago been pointed out that the pet parson holds as it were an intermediate position between the sexes male and femalehe is a weaker man he is a stronger woman and it is against this emasculate condition which has been forced upon our priest hood graduallynow by rampant platitudinarianismn now by rampant attitudinarianismthat our muscularians have risen in revolt such discussions as mr rollope brings forwardhow far a clergyman is justified in putting himself in the way of contaminationwhether his virtue is pure enough to resist seduction and strong enough to repel ravishmentwhether the pharisaical attitude of gathering ones garmelits about one is not the most becoming and the safest attitude for himsuch discussions take for granted the semifeminity of the clergy and propose only to decide what precise cross between breeches and crinoline would be their most fitting garb another novelist is fond of touching upon this parson questiontouching upon it in its social light and in an humorous manner if mr trollope cannot get cured of his itch parsonwards he would do well to study george eliots treatment of the subject to return to the hypothesis of manners being the proper subject of the novel accepting this we must inquire what manners are in the sense of our definition manners are the conventional habits of society society lives in london for so many months of the year at countryteats for so many hunts in leicestershire during this season fish in norway during that shoots in scotland or travels on the continent during another society has its boxes and stalls at the opera its entrance into certain houses it consists of lords and commoners anl of some few out of the lower world who gain admittance into society by reason of their great wealth higher dignitaries of the church are in society and during the countryseat season parishparsons gain entrance on a lower footing sometimes an apothecary or a lawyer is heard of there lbut either is sure to have a ludicrous name and a burlesque manner ladiesmaids and foot men and grooms play the broadly comic parts speaking a language peculiar to themselves alone the countryseat has its attendant village and so we hear of robin postman and mrs podgerss baby the town has terrible dens upon its outskirts whither wild young men resort and so we are introduced to the tozer family society consists of a few thousand people who all agree to live much in the same way and to do the same things probably among these few thousands there is genuine tragedy and farce enough to form the basis of as heartmoving a human story as has ever been written animal hetties and mystical dinabs godfrey casses devotees of favourablechance and silas marners godstricken we have them all in those higher walks of life made by the same maker creepitig on the same earth different only in that their clothes are finer and their grammar more precise but then these deeper commotions of life never rise to the smooth surface of mlanner lovesick lucy wears innumerable flounces and the flounces are the chief business of our novelist we want description of the savages warpaint not speculations as to his thirst for blood to say that there are no touches of nature in framley parsonage wvould be untrue but we do say that they are almost lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming floods of conventionality lucy is pleasantly drawn and sometimes her satiric utterances against herself express as well as can be her bitterness of heart thedevotion of mrs robarts in the bailiffscene is touching the spice of poetry that exists in sowerby gains instant acknowledgment in every heart as true the pride of crawley in its first conception is excellent but then fmr trollope has chosen to burlesque it with his flippant wit there are passages in this book so truthful so pathetic so humourous that they move those who are not admirers of the author to a tenfold impatience of the mass of twaddle in which they are buried the standard which the story sets up for itself is a false one there are no men and women in  framley parsonage  they are never viewed as men and women but only with regard to their relations to society the only conscience in the book is what will the world say the only morality  such conduct does not become such a position unfrock mark robarts anrd he does not exist deprive lord lufton of his title mliss dunstable of her wealth and they cease to be no doubt the accidents of life affect inen greatly but men do exist apart from these accidents we can take hetty strip her of her lowcly circumstances and raise her to the rank of a lady and she will remain the same hetty in maggie tulliver we have the very type of a nature always at war with the circumstances encompassing it but can we imagine lucy robarts lowercd to the station of hetty  does she not disappear entirely when we take from her her educated sharpness of tongue and her conventional notions of propriety  it is because mr frollopes characters are not men and women hut effects of given circumstances only that be errs so greatly in bringing them again and again upon the stage he has not the wonderful talent to show a beatrix esmond developed into a baroness bernstein  i   we have said enough about mr trollope to show that we differ from all the world in our estimate of his novels he is now perhaps the most popular of our modern novelists his name heaven save thc mark is coupled with the toast of english literature at literary dinners is novelwriting the highest branch of literature  and have we no dickens or thackeray to represent it if it is rumour promises us another novel from his hand in the pages of the cornhill his orley farm illustrated by an artist once our first is on every drawingroom table mnr trollope is at the height of his fame we prophesy that he will live to see his novels rated at their worth that we should return to an admniration of the fashionable novel long since buried beneath worthier fictions now resuscitated in all its flimsy flippancy is not a good sign ja i  rr tile literary examiner 7 itklei i unonage by anthony trollope author of  barchester towers c c with six illustrations by t e millais ra in three volumes smith elder and co the warden and barchester towers are the only novels of mr trollopes better than framley parsonage it has been said that every man if he could write it has one good novel in bin barchester tower is a sequel to the warden and framley parsonage is an appendix to them both it is in as far as they resemble the warden that the sequel and appendix claim preeminence because they contain the particular novel that seems to have been according to this notion in mr trollope or that which it was in his nature to write better than another man however superior he might be in genius could have written it his sketches of clerical life are his own when writing upon other topics he is always clever lively and observant but the limits to his power are more clearly manifest mr anthony trollope is not in the highest sense a man of genius in all his works best and worst perhaps there is not a touch of original fancy as far as it is possible for a no ve 1st to be without invention he is without it there is nc ingenuity in the construction of his stories the sketches of character on which they depend for their value are the result of shrewd observation cleverly expressed in everyday phrase never of any subtle or peculiar insight into character a remark that a square forehead expresses intelligence rather than thought or that most eyes are green may be said to represent the utmost stretch of mr trollopes subtlety these are such individual opinions and notes of observation as one may hear daily from a b c and d at any dinnertable without wondering at a b c or ds profundity but they are always lively and clever in expression always therefore acceptable again in the inability to represent strong passion mr trollope shows his want of the insight that belongs to genius the passion of lucy hobarts in framley parsonage when she pours out her secret misery of a baulked love to her sisterinlaw is an example of this she speaks of herself as having been  bowled over like a ninepin when she was so sure that she  should never be missish and spoony and sen ti  mental calls herself an unutterable ass and so forth all which is of course very manly and preserves the author from all risk of being himself considered to write spoony love passages but it does not represent the passion of a woman even when she as lucy is here doing hysterically mocks at her own grief there is no want of hearty feeling in the book a healthy human sense of what he has fairly seen and entered into with full understanding in the course of life is no mean part of the strength of this as of all mr trollopes novels the author is no doubt too much at the usual level of society in observation and expression to admit of pathos in his writings they do not even contain any flashes of the wit with which not a few men who do not write are able to enliven social intercourse but when he is at home with his subject and it represents a cause that has his sympathy mr trollopes clear expression of a wholesome human feeling makes its wsy home to the readers heart there is force then snd there is some force everywhere in the literalness on which he depends necessarily for his power as a novelist the literalneeb let it be leceembered of a thoroughly quickwitted and observant man mr tieheee is et his heat we hewe laid when writs of the clergy not of the bench of bishops for his bishop is a feeble caricature but of the leaser dignitaries of the cathedral close their wives and daughters and not of these only as framley parsonage shows the picture of mark roberts the young country rector too early possessed of a good living who is tempted into the fast set of country society beguiled by an embarrassed county member and led through weakness of character to risk the very existence of a home to which he is attached j with his whole heart is excellent the domestic sulo ofhis nature is well kept in view and even when ho  known in thc county as a hunting parson we ay mario to understand together with his weakness the dornotio qualities and the religious nature underlying p the sketch of the generous impulsive wife and a nr rc el ornate study of the not less generous friend and neighbour tidy j lufton patroness of the living whose son was marks j schoolfellow and is his friend are simply fault ss the j little weaknesses and the great strength of a relined womanly nature in lady lufton thc simple and iojd j hearted prejudices the pleasant airs nf patronage always a part of the true dignity with which she is inviterthe1 generous conquests of prejudice and temper and though gentle j sacrifices that come of the love ot a widow ibr her on iv son are combined in the character of lady linton with i deli  cacy of touch that is perhaps only the more admirably true j and effective for that literalness of manner upon which we have just dwelt lord luftonher handsome and good1 natured son who falls for a short time into the hands of i the philistines and mr sowerby the embarrassed county i member whose estates are mortgaged to whom little bills are a necessity of daily life and who with unprincipled goodnature never with malice ruins himself and swindles his friends represent also thoroughly well certain forms of life the weakest parts of the book are those which affect political satire the meeting at gatherum castle  all that relates to the immensity of tom towers to the jupiter and to mr harold smith who becomes lord petty bag or to the parliamentary struggle described as a contest between the gods and giants is feeble and confused the blending of false names of party leaders with the most resent dates the triviality of the particular alludion sometimes blended with a clumsy and exaggerated general satire represent the defective side of mr trollopes literalness it may please some readers to congratulate themselves on their own cleverness in identifying with lord brougham the lord boanerges who explains the philosophy of soap bubbles to mis dunstable at that assembly at gatherum castle about which the readers curiosity was raised only to bc disappointed utterly but mr trollope makes visible no reason that he could have had in art as a writer or in politics as a satirist for an introduction of lord brougham in that place neither is the passing sketch of him in any respect clever this criticism applies to everything that may have been meant for political satire in framley parsonage the chapter on the triumph of the giants is kindred in its affectation and clumsiness to some of the classical chapter headings and to the silly opening of the penultimate chapter entitled nemesis by introducing nemesis as  peen a that just but rhadamanthine goddess  whom we moderns ordinarily call punishment or nemesis  when we wish to speak of her goddessship straight j forward and sensible as he is owing much of his popularity i to the fact that he is the cleverest of novelists who with j out being more subtle than most of their neighbours speak j to the world in their own way out of a shrewd head and a sound heart mr trollope still has affectation  oe conquered there is one very noticeable but necessary osequence of this wandering beyond the true bounds of hi  skill by a writer who for his knowledge of character depends j on clever and genial observation rather than on what may be called the intuition of genius ft is that the distinctest men and women side by side with the most shadowy abstractions people the same book ieverything is real at framley there is an admixture of mei  ghosts at chaldicotes and they are all ghosts at gahrrunir castle while as for the town gods and giants they aro as like anything in life as mr trollopes articles suppose to have been written

fables ore of the simplest construction her incidents in the common course of things and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation the story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases there are no exaggerations and no deficiencies and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fullness of the effect is produced the persons described are such as we meet every day in society but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of actionthe one illustrating the otherand moreover most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates self is a great disturber of the observing faculties in miss austens novels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world and free from the engrossment of acting a part in it we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked the commonplace characters of the town and the village are the characters which miss austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood in the story before us what an example of the worthless

stamp of circulatinglibrary popularity put upon her works before the superior judges had become acquainted with them and recognised their high degree of excellence the quarterly review to its honour be it remembered was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius it is remarkable that scott who noticed with praise many inferior authors never mentioned miss austen perhaps because she was not an inferior author perhaps for the same reason that caused sir walter to consider fieldings incomparable satire jonathan wild only as a story the present judicious blication is we see to be followed by  emma  northanier abbey  mansfield park and persuasion but suely it cannot be intended to omit  pride and

B2585,"['8793448', '8688126']",  mmdlemarch  jfiddlemarch a study of provincial life by george eiiot in four volumev blackwood 1 many theresas have been born who found for them i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with t he meanness of opportunity perhaps a tragic failure f vhich found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion 1 with dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness for these laterborn t1cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other k oudemned as a lapse we need to recall those sentences in the prelude  to  middlemarch  in order to reconcile ourselves to its finale in which our last glimpse of george eliots modern theresa is as a comfortable matron very properly devoted to her second husband and only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother any other novelist would have ended the novel differently and with a good deal more stageeffect but george eliots finding is the true one and if we part from dorothea with somi regret that her first great failure as the wife of mr iasaubon should have no better compensation than the very prosaic success of a marriage with will ladislaw it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befall the worthiest natures while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy the most carefully mwrought out of all george eliots novels with the exception perhaps of romola  middlemarch  is also the most uelancholy in its tone it is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of haracter that go to make up our commonplace society and the impression left by this  study of provincial life  is one of pftinful but healthy sadness there is nothing of the misanthrope in george eliot if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world she does so altogether in order to help on their correction and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preachers sermons but we have no more right to look for shallow merrymaking in her books than to seek amusement from  ecclesiastes or  lamentations she does not preach that  all is vanity and vexation of spirit or that  the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied  but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered it is with others in their various ways as with dorothea whose later life is the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions among the ay oek a her mises it was never maid in t ighborood of middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own ageon modes of education which make a womans knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondlyasserted beliefs while this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe there will be collisions such as those in dorotheas life where great feelings will take the aspect of error and great faith the aspect of illusion dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in mid dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round we see her first in striking con trast to her simpleminded sister celia and her as simpleminded uncle mr brooke as a highsouled young woman  enamoured of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes the rashness causes her to embrace mr casaubon the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness until all her  vague ideals  have to give place to  the common yearning of womanhood in noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change we have seen how gradually dorothea loses faith in her husband without swerving at all in her duty towards him even as the most exacting purist might define it and how as gradually the way is prepared for her devotion after her husbands death to his cousin will ladislaw it is not easy to like young ladislaw one is tempted to think that in marrying him dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying mr casaubon how much pleasanter it would have been for lydgate to be her husband but unfortunately things do not always go pleasantly in real life and the fate that befalls dorothea is very natural though not very welcome lydgates fate is harder than dorotheas this portrait of the brave man of science whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallowhearted beauty is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of dorothea lydgate and rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of  middlemarch and in tracing their history george eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an illassorted marriage not the consequences with which novelreaders are familiar in which the silly wife runs away from her husband or the husband is a brute to his wife but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken perhaps george eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show  oh it is hard says dorothea to him that all this should come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways there is no sorrow i have thought more about than thatto love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail if selfish rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to dorothea unselfish mary garth is a no less complete foil of another sort the really pleasantest portions of  fiddle march are those that recount the sayings and doings of lmary and her father caleb garth and caleb garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent welldoing that makes no pretence tovirtue asexcellent in itswayisthe study of nicholas bulstrode the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied bulstrode3 downfall is described with great i ability and perhaps the best part of the description is f this which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she  has heard of his wrongdoings and of the worse doings r attributed to him t she locked herself in her room she needed time to get used s to her maimed consciousness her poor lopped life before she  could walk steadily to the place aotted her a new rgicbin light had fallen on her husbands character and she could not j ge him leniently the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit he had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal but this imperfectlytaught woman whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork had a loyal spirit within her the man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life and who had unvaryingly cherished hernow that punishment had l fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him tihere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul withering it the more by uloving proximity she knew when she locked her door that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow and say of his guilt i will mourn and not ixcproach but she needed time to gather up her strength she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife when she had resolved to go down she prepared herself by t ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker tiey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation she took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1ack gown and instead of wearing her muchadorned cap and large bows of hair she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b netcap which made her look suddenly like an early methodist bulstrode who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well had spent the time in an agitation co aal to hers he had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others and had acquiesced in that probability as something easier to him than any confession but now that he imagined the amelnt of her knowledge come he awaited the result in anguish liii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him and tiiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him he had not touched it he felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery perhaps he should never see his wifes face with affection in it again and if he turned to god there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution it was eight oclock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered he dared not look up at her he sat with is eyes bent down and as she went towards him she thought he looked smallerhe seemed so withered and shrunken a moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair and the other on his shoulder she said solemnly 1 t kindly look up nicholas he raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half damazed for a moment her pale face her changed mourning css the trembling about her mouth all said  i know  and her hands and eyes rested gently on him he burst out crying and tiny cried together she sitting at his side they could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim or of the acts which had brought it down on them his confession was silent and her promise of faithfulness was silent openminded as she was she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire she could not say  how much is only slander and false suspicion   and he did not say  i ani innocent the charity of middlemarch is as notable as its wisdom in every way it is a book to be glad of and if it does not enhance george eliots fame it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians   i i  middlemarch saturday march 30 1s72 literature by george eliot book iii waiting for death blackwood  sons the third instalment of  middlemarch ends in doubta doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form old peter featherstone not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind is dying fast and vulturelike the featherstones and waules close round him with testamentary purpose brothers solomon and jonah and sisters martha and jane take bodily possession of stone court where are also installed mary garth of right and mrs viney and her son fred by mr featherstones request that the featherstones should hang together against the vineys is natural still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves and that there should be a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him no scrutiny however can open the secret of old peters iron box true to himself the old man snaps and snarls at everybody is oracular as to his will and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power in the night alone with mary garth he dies he has it seems made two wills of which he wishes to burn one but both remain  and upon their tenor hangs fred vineys life for fred has borrowed money with all belief in his powers of repayment  having the superfluous securities of hope at his command and mary garths father has backed freds bill and fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh and  not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people is now in most unhappy plight seeing himself in his true light as a pitiful rascal who is robbing other people of their savings but it is not for fred and mary alone that the plot is thickening lydgatehow or why it would be as hard to say as in real life  finds himself engaged to rosamond viney and mr viney who is expecting stone court for fred has given his consent to the arrangement  with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch for  the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action and mr viney has discovered that old featherstones death is only his  demise and  considered as a demise old featherstones death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity1 and besides lydgate and rosamond dorothea too claims our interest as mr casaubon is too clearly dying fastindeed has a fit which can have but one meaning and dorotheas future is still further perplexed by the fact that mr brooke who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men has asked young will ladislaw to stop with him  feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas and more than all exactly as  old and young put the riddle of which the answer lies in  waiting for death so in  waiting for death  a riddle is put in the thirtieth chapter the answer to which is even harder to guess and ought to be the hinge of the tale for the rest  middlemarch is itself celia is to become lady chettam and is very full of happiness mr brook is more happily vague than ever his advice to casaubon after his fit being  yes yes get dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings and shuttlecock now i dont know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime i remember it all the fashion to be sure your eyes might not stand that casaubon but you must unbend you know why you might take to some light study  conchology now  i always think that must be a light study or get dorothea to read you light things smollett roderick random humphrey clinker they are a little broad but she may read anything now shes married you know i remember they made me laugh uncommonlytheres a droll bit about a postilions breeches we have no such humour now i have gone through all these things but they might be rather new to you and we have one or two new actors such as mr horrock the horsedealer  whose costume at a glance gives him a thrilling association with horses and whom nature has blessed with  a face which by dint of mongolian eyes and a nose mouth and chin seeming to follow his hatbrim in a moderate inclination upwards gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind and when accompanied by adequate silence likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding an infinite fund of humourtoo dry to flow and probably in a state of immovable crustand a critical judgement which if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it would be the thing and no other and with mr horrock is mr trumbull the auctioneer who is  an amateur of superior phrases never using poor language without immediately correcting himself aud who if anybody had observed of him that mr borthrop trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that still more heavily outlined is solomon featherstone who  thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellowmen inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there  coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others and there is also mrs plymdale who  doesnt think that marrying is everything and indeed  would have a girl first seek the kingdom of god  but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters and so holds that  a girl should keep her heart within her own power what the end of  middlemarch may be we hardly wish to guess its chief interest is as a study of english life the action does not absorb us as in  adam bede and the mill ou the floss there are too many actors for that and too many threads woven into the one strand  but as a thoughtful anatomy of english habits and english modes of thought full of dry quiet humour waiting for death is worthy its author whether  middlemarch as a whole will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails remains to be seen certainly as yet each part has been perfect of itself,social

sun and casting his eyes upon the babel out of which it rew until he traced it down to the furthest outposts of the invading army of bricks and mortar whose station lay for the present nearly at his feetmight feel at last that he was clear of london    they were now in the open country the houses were very few and scattered at long intervals often miles apart occasionally they came upon a cluster of poor cottages some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children rom the road others shut up close while all tne family were working in the fields these were often the commencement of a little village and after an interval came a wheelwrights shed or perhaps a blacksmiths forge then a thriving farm with sleepy cows wing about the yard and horses peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses passed upon the road as though in triumph at their freedom there were dull pigs too turning up thc ground in search of dainty food ann grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about or crossed each other in their quest plump pigeons skimming round the roof or strutting on the eaves and ducks and geese far more graceful in their own conceit waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing glibly on its surface the farmyard passed then came the little inn the humbler beershop and the village tradesmans then the lawyers and the parsons at whose dread names the ber shop trembled the church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees then there were a few more cottages then the cage and pound and not uofreauently on a bank by the wayside a deep old dusty well then came the trimhedged nelda on either hand and the open road again the concluding passages of the number are yet more striking for a quaint originality of conception that is in them they introduce us to two wellcontrasted exhibitors of punch seated among the tombs of a village churchyard and very busily engaged with needful repairs

childhood like some ol the patent sharpeners that give a hasty edge to the knife at the expense of a rapid waste of metal so does care act on the juvenile spirit and the observer may daily see but too many of such young blades precociously worn thin and so unnaturally keen that like our oversharpened knives they could almost cut with their backs in strong contrast to nelly we have the old man her

the pleasure of being cheateda pleasure so congenial to human nature that in ho absence of any other swindler ve cheat ourselves no one ever played as a practice except for the sake of play  and the
