anthony dares progress by archibald marshall 7s 6d collins we are never quite sure how much mr marshal himself cares about tony dare he writes about him so evenly so placidly so kindly that it is easy to imagine he approves of him if we are not very much mistaken however mr marshal is giving us a very quiet and subtly touched portrait of a weak and selfish though winning personality anthony is doing journalism very successfully in london when this part of his history begins he is mixing by happy chance with people socially much above him and opportunity is afforded him to fall in love with lady penelope st leger the girls sweet tender and changeable character is very cleverly suggested for she does not talk very much  indeed there is surprisingly little conversation in the novel this makes it a real achievement for after all it is to dialogue that the reader generally trusts for entertainment mr lmarshalls way of telling a tale is perfectly delightflll never dull and how full of acute touches their intercourse was habitually flavoured with joking speech and they knewv when to let each other alone it is doubtful whether there would have been enough between them to support a long visit without constraint again after a weekend in a country house full of gay guests when tony stays on young children now seemed to pervade the house rue elder children came down to luncheon and the talk of the elders was quite different from what it had been tonys marriage to the rich widow lady amarch of humble origin leaves us longing for mr marshalls next volume,war_contra

fiction the last ditch by violet hunt stanley paul and co 7s net violet hunt in a frankly critical mood is always good and in this novel she has a theme after the cynics own heartdecadence the last ditch  is of course the aristocracy fighting for self preservation very splendid in war very deflated after war and particularly socially which is the side of the authors examination she knows her world in a sense she sympathises nor is there any attempt to indulge in an extravaganza types are the authors interest they are types we could almost name they are lovable peple however selfish cynical inhuman they think anyone not born in the set smells and this class obsession becomes acutely ridiculous when one of the leading daughters takes up with a socialist and actually becomes engaged to him the end is the justification of type the socialist kisses violently and the daughter rebels the man of type saves her and we have them admirably correct in their conjugal demeanour in a small home somewhere on the golf links all this is very amusing poignantly observant pleasingly cruel nor can it be called satire society is satire and violet hunt has made the most of it,war_contra
1lovel flotes the house of war by marmaduke pickthall 6s tx 4au the house of war mr pickthall tells us  was the designation given formerly to all those christians of the countries conquered by the muslims who declined to embrace el islam    but the christians of the turkish empire have now for several generations become a house of war in a much wider sense a development to which the european missionaries who come and go have often inadvertently contributed the authors prefatory note well indicates the theme of  the house of war a novel in which mir pickthall is inclined to allow his purpose to take precedence over his plot most emphatically he does not approve of christian missions in mahomedan countries and so for the purposes of his story he has invented a heroine who is coldblooded and almost incredibly pigheaded indeed one finds it difficult to believe that so broadminded a man as fenn would have found anything to attract him in elsie nevertheless  the house of war is an interesting at times an exciting story and it is well worth reading for its vivid picture of life as it was lived by europeans in the near east before the declaration of war,war_contra
the eagles shadow by james branch cabell heinemann 6s should anybody be in search of a delightful story charmingly and wittily and crisply written to send as a welcome gift at this time of the year we would say buy the eagles shadow  its illustrations are good its endpapers are a joy and the written words between those endpapers weave a healthy and tender story that it is a pleasure to read the author has gotten  the english colonel most excellently well except that an english officer should not say gotten the hero and the heroine however dominate the book and they are very much alive the little world round about the girl is very gracefully presented and the observation though not very deep is always true and often very sly  she cared no more for shakespeare than the average woman does and she was never quite comfortable when he was alluded to that is very neatly putas indeed are most things in this pleasant volume  the eagles shadow by james branch cabell heinemann in reading the eagles shadow one is reminded of goethes distich which indeed would serve as a fairly sufficient criticism of the book wiltat du echon zierlich erecheinen und biet uicbt sicher  vergebene nur aua vollendeter kraft thicket die anmuth hervor mr cabell strives to attain ease and grace in that vein of light comedy of which mr henry harland is for the moment the most popular master but the best that can be said for him is that he does not fail very egregiously he has occasionally happy turns of phrase his epigrams are now and then tolerable and his dialogue is on the whole amusing but his attempts at elegance are often rather awkward and his familiarity inept and the essence of a readers enjoyment in writing of this kind is that he should feel secure of the authors good taste and lightness of touch the narrative itself in spite of an infusion of exciting incident is of oourse subordinate to the manner of narration we know from the beginning that merit and wealth each being much in love with the other are bound to come together eventually and our curiosity as to how this is to be accomplished is never very keen the plot however is entertainingly enough developed and there is au air of good spirits about the whole thing that is not without attraction the atmosphere is distinctly american,war_contra
  your uncle lew a naturalbom american by c reginald sherlock hutchinson co mk sherlocks story reminds us somewhat of the old  sayings and doings  fiction of seventy or eighty years ago of the type of story of which some of theodore hooks novels and haliburtons books are the best remembered specimens lewis dunbar unclelew is a rather mysterious keeper of an eatinghouse in the town of salina and his racy talk is supposed to have been always welcome to his townsmen incidentally he has a beautiful daughter whom he educates away from the unfitting surroundings in which he makes the money that is to ensure her a good time dunbar falls in with a young fellow named hillyer and they devote themselves to discovering a showmans fraud while later dunbar makes a strange sensation in the racing world the book has a horsey flavour throughout but though entertaining in parts is not likely to appeal to a very large circle of british readers,war_contra
quakerism  or the sttirg of my life bv a lady who for forty years was a member of the society of friends dublin oldham ix spite of the authors affirmation that she is anxious only to do good to the society to  which she once belonged we doubt if any member of the connexion can possibly look on her efforts in their behalf in the light of service in her preface she intimates that if she shall be accused of attacking with false statements or false colours under shelter of the anonymous j she will publish her next edition with her name  but then she will publish also the names of all the individuals to whom her statements refer  the place and time of each circumstance and the original documents from which her story is condensed already however many of these are designated under appellations which can deceive no one taking the remotest interest in her subject surely those who read can translate elizabeth grill without any difficulty eec c the feeblenesses the follies the formalities here summed up will be questioned by no one acquainted with the inner disciplinal observances of quakerismbut they are not so exclusively the property of the sect as the authoress would have us believe singular their form may be with thesebut their essence is universal  inevitable we may add in all cases where subscription is pressed on the members of any sect as a saving grace the timid the foolish the disingenuous will always cling to misapprehend and evade ceremonials think of the abuses that crept into the monastic orders under cover of cowl and surplice consider the number of houses  divided against themselves in this enlightened england of ours at the time present by the question of the pair of candles on the protestant altar  then for illustrations ofthe  voluntary system we fear that certain sectarian periodicals if examined would disclose a depressing amount of nonsense preached and exaction submitted to yet the  lady who issues this book proceeds apparently on the assumption that the sect which she has quitted monopolises all the vulgarity greediness worldliness and inanity which disfigure the world of high professors there is scarcely a word of exception or qualificationscarcely an indication of the solid worth and sincere if narrow selfsacrifice which must also be credited to quakerism else must it long ere this have crumbled to nothing out of its own sheer rottenness the student of manners as influenced by opinions will find some quaint specimens of behaviour recorded from life in these pages to exhibit such at length to the general reader would be of small profit so peculiar are the alphabet and parlance of the society of friends so little really like those of the uncouth caricatures which have long figured as prim and angular drolls in fiction and in farce nor do the most elaborate pictures of quarterly meeting revels and yearly meeting inanities spread out by our authoress outdo in verisimilitude or quintessential humour the proceedings of dorcas fyshe and sister rumble more succinctlv recorded in hoods  quakers conversazione the grotesque examples of pulpit oratory again here gathered are not so grotesque as others which we could add yet this very form of appeal and  improvement presented itself to charles lamb in no exclusively ridiculous point of view and if he a stranger could feel toleration for a mode of address so whimsical and peculiar our selfemancipated quakeress might have pointed out the sound kernel as well as the rotten husk the following general remark however merits emphatic extract j  it is really a very difficult thing for a quaker  to be consistent with his own principles and even  the most rigid are often found swallowing them wholesale por instance the vain adorning of the person with dress jewellery and gold he considers it a sin to indulge in those things and yet in his shop he sells them he makes his money by providing for the sins of bis fellowchristians he deems it a right thing to wear a broad brim to bis hat but he has no scruple about making and selling hats of a fashionable form for his fellow christians to wear isle would not be so wicked as to dress his servant up in livery with a gold band c but in the way of business he will do it for another if the  peculiarities are essential to the salvation of a quakerarc they not also essential for all christians can it be that friends sell and deal in those forbidden thing because they think the people ofthe worldhave no chance of salvation at all and that therefore it signifies but little what they indulge in so that friends profit by it in the above passage is stated the cardinal difficulty of the society wherein lie the seeds of its decay such nonconformity as its statutes of discipline profess is not merely at variance with every rule of nature and common sense but if honestly carried out is totally incompatible with the simplest transactions of life the really consistent quaker who declines wearing primary colours because there is a snare in scarlet is the elder there was such a man  who was made uneasy in his mind by the sight of red clover he can be neither a haberdasher nor an upholsterer nor a toymaker nor a seller of fancy goodshardly an innkeeper or a chaise proprietor his rule is stricter than that of the strictest monastic asceticism without the monastery walls to shut him away from the vain world and the religious ceremonies to supply that want which knocks loud at the heart of every human creature who has been born with an iota of imagination the quakers rule is untenable whence subterfuge compromise evasion unsettlement of mindpushed to its extremitywe will quote an instance which is amusing in itself and amusingly related the lady had married and removed to bristol  soon after becoming a housekeeper i was called on by the tithe collector friends annually sum up the amount of all they have lost by this suffering as they call it and i was then under the idea that our noble testimony against an hireling ministry was an essential part of all true christianity and that our refusal to pay the unholy tax was an acceptable martyrdom in a small way i had heard much preaching on the subject and very much selflaudation on the faithfulness of the society gene rally indeed universally to this our testimony which so widely separated us from the hirelings of all other creeds the two men who called on me for the purpose of collecting the disputed impost were exceedingly gentle and polite they saw at a glance that i was an ignoramus and kindly volunteered to inform me how other quakers managed for i had told them that my profession would not allow me to pay tithes and that if they insisted on forcibly taking away my property though i would not resist still i would look on it as actual robberydid you ever pay tithes maam  said one of the men  never i replied well then said he you are a stranger here i see and ill just tell you how the bristol quakers manage for i am going about among them for twenty years past and i am always glad to accommodate them and meet their scruples the sum you must pay is one guinea so i will call here tomorrow at eleven oclock in the morning and you just leave on the sideboard there some articles of plateyour teapot will do very well or spoons or whatever you likethen i come and take it away you dont give it and so your conscience is clear you will then return to your meetingpeople that your teapot worth ten guineas was distrained for tithe and as soon after as you like you can go to mr jones the silversmith and tell him how you lost your teapot and are obliged to buy a new one he will condole with you and after showing you a variety of new ones to select from he will hand you your own identical article and say he can sell you that cheapsay one guinea you pay your guinea and get your own safe back again cleaner and brighter than ever and if you like you can purchase some other little trifling article for mr jones is a very accommodating man1i was teally shocked at the cool proposal of so nefarious and j unprincipled a transaction and indignantly rejected  it declaring at the same time my firm belief that no quaker would be guilty of so undignified and false an act the man smiled and said  aye that is the way they all go on at first but maam it is a gteat deal the easiest and best plan in the end and then he gave nie the names of very many my own acquaintances who regularly once a year as he jocularly said allowed mr jones to clean their plate  there is old mr r said he  has a fine massive silver teapot it is always laid out ready for me i always give notice before i go and now twenty times i have carried it off and got it brightened for him he values it at twenty pounds and his tithe is only one pound ten and there is young mr r isle likes mc to get his spoons done for him isle gives so many dinners he likes to have them bright and newlooking seeing me still very incredulous he said well maam i wont call on you for a week to give you time to think about the matter during that week i went to old mr rs and told his daughter that tithes had been demanded of me but that i had not paid them and was expecting another visit from the collectoroh yes said she  this is just the time they go about they seized a valuable silver teapot from us last week my father values it at twenty guineas and the demand in money is only about thirty shillings but it is a noble testimony we are calied on to bear and i trust our faithfulness will yet be the means of opening the eyes of professing christians to the nature of a pure free gospel ministry i trust my young friend thou wilt be faithfulshe spoke so seriously that i hesitated to say what i intended about joness shop lest the idea that i for a moment could think her or her father capable of such a deed might offend i then called on young mrs r and mentioned the same thing to herthey did indeed said she take our spoons but my william has some way or other to get them back i cant tell how he manages but i suppose they are ashamed of taking so much over their demand and so return them at any rate they are sent back beautifully polished and not only that but a handsome sugarspoon with our crest engraved on it was also amongst them i suppose they were sorry and put in the spoon by way of atonement i suspected that my friend william might know more than his wife on the subject but said nothing i then went to joness shop and boldly asked if they would return me articles of plate which might be distrained for tithe on paying the exact amount of tithe demanded and was politely infoimed that they would be most happy to do soto enter into the same arrangement with me ns with other quakers but said i what recompense will you require for affording me so great an accommodation  none whatever replied the shopkeeper  the friends are very good customers of ours we are always glad to see them entering our doors and what must i pay the collectorsthey make no charge either you can give them an odd shilling now and then if you like for they are very honest civil fellowsfaithful to their appointment at the end of the week the men came to me walked straight jpto the parlour and over to the sideboard and looked disappointed not to find the plate ready laid out for them i told them i had to apologise for doubting their veracity i had inquired and found that their statement was true but as i could not see any sense in such a roundabout way of paying i thought it simplar and came to the same thing in the end to pay the money at once which i did there is no denying the cleverness of these sketchesand we are tempted to take another examplebut merely forthe amusement of our readers the species of intrigue which it records is well known beyond the bounds of quakerism only it takes here pleasant colours from the quaint and peculiar modes of life in which it is acted  i was one evening nt a large tea party introduced to a very beautiful young bride she had a large figure well and most gracefully formed the roseate hue of her cheek and the soft brilliancy of her downcast eyes were only equalled in beauty by the exquisitely fair neck and the rich dark brown hair banded in the smoothest madonna style on her lofty brow her dress was of the richest dovecoloured satin and ber quaker cap and neckhandkerchief folded in neat plaits across her bosom were of indias most costly muslin the handkerchief was attached to the dress by a gold pin with a pearl head and the belt of her dress was fastened in front by two more gold pins each with a diamond head the bridegroom was a very small thin awkward illmade man his facefrom which every morsel of whisker had been shaved offwas white flat and meaningless and his dress though quite new was badly made and badly put on it was however a strictly quaker costume in the course of the evening i said to the lady who had introduced me however did that meanlooking little man manage to get such a very lovely bride she smiled and answered  strange as it may seem i assure thee it was rachel who courted him not he her i will tell thee the story about four years ago rachels younger sister was married and she was somewhat annoyed that she the elder and so much the handsomer should have been passed by so she resolved to provide herself with a husband and thou knowest when a woman makes up her mind to do a thing she triymphs over every obstacle rachels first step was to draw out a list of the names of the eligible young men opposite to each name she placed the amount of his annual income as correctly as she could ascertain it the most wealthy was placed at the top of the list and so on in regular gradation she had twelve names dosvn they lived in all parts of england  one in london one in york one in bristol and so on sylvnnus otway was at the head of the list she had never seen him and he lived near norwich he was down for seven thousand a year rachel seriously informed her father and mother that she had  a concern to attend the norwich quarterly meeting they had no acquaintances they cared for there and were disinclined to take so long a journey but rachel became so silent nnd sad and po often told them she was burdened with the weight of her concern to go that they at length yielded to her wishes and father nnd mother rachel and her sister susanna and one of the brothers all went to norwich as the father and mother are acknowledged ministers of course they were taken much notice of and invited to all the friends houses amongst others to friend otways and rachel soon had the pleasure of being introduced to sylvanus she was delighted to find him a fine handsome intelligentlooking young man and to perceive that he was decidedly i fascinated with his new acquaintances and when at parting he whispered to her sister loud enough fa rachel to hear i hope soon to be in your city into have the pleasure of calling at your house  cheek flushed with triumph and her heart palpitated with joy at the success of her scheme sylvans soon followed them as he had promised and propogd for susanna he was promptly accepted andtw were married as speedily as the rules of our society would permit rachel was exceedingly vexed and disappointed but she is not a person to be dacomfited by one failure so she resolved to try again hit she has never been friendly with susanna sincehe next on her list was josiah gumble of york and his income was six thousand again she informed her father that she felt it was required of her to attend the york quarterly meeting and she added  it had been born in on her mind that the ministry of her beloved father at that solemn assembly would be blessed to some waiting minds there is nothing pleases our ministers more than flattery of their preaching gifts rachel is an adept at it i hare often found it difficult to keep my features in sober decorum when i have heard her speaking of the inward peace she had felt from the acceptable servite of her much valued friends and then she preaes the hand of the minister she is flattering with io much feeling as she says but they like it and rachel has her own ends in view she went to york and soon obtained the desired introduction to josiah gumble he too was young and passably welllooking rachel contrived to be very much in his company  but she saw clearly that he could not be caught she told me she had never met any man who was so coldly insensible to beauty and so stupidly indifferent to flattery however rachel was not dheartened for it soon came out that josiah wai the victim of an unrighteous attachment to the daughter of a clergyman for love of whom he deserted our israel and is nowalas that it should be sowith his six thousand a year gone over to the camp ofthe alien the thud on rachels list was john jones of londonher bridegroom now he is worth about two thousand a year and as thou must see no beauty when rachel first saw him she was half inclined to leave him for somebody else but the next on her list is only six hundred a year the sacrifice was too great and besides james lewis might be as meanlooking so she resolved on the conquest of john jones it was very easily accomplished he made no resistance he at once became the worshipper of her beauty and now that they are married i think it will be her own fault if she is not happy he is not very wise but lie is goodhumoured and goodnatured  how did thou become acquainted with this amusing story  said i  is it not a breach of confidence to tell itno indeed she replied  there were more than a dozen of us in the room when she told it herself and showed us the list she said she did not want it now so she gave it to martha elton and bade her give a copy of it to any of the girls who would like to try the same plan of getting settled in life here is an anecdote of the regency which will be new to many of our readers  i was shown in the womens meetingroom the seat on which his majesty king george iv when prince regent had for a moment placed himself when led by the spirit of adventure and as my informant stated a most unbecoming curiosity he had disguised as a woman friend made his way into the secret conclave his dress was all right a grey silk gown a brown cloth shawl a little white silk handkerchief with hemmed edge round his neck and a very wellpoked friends bonnet with the neatly crimped border of his clear muslin cap tied under the chin completed the disguise in which he might have escaped detection very well were it not for the telltale boots and the unfeminine position in which the arms and legs bestowed themselves the young woman who sat behind him and saw the heel protruding from its silken robe slipt quietly out of meeting and gave the alarm two men friends were speedily summoned and the royal intruder felt himself gently tapped on the shoulder and requested to walk into another room he made no resistance but quietly went away and receiving the usual notice that the rules of the society would not allow any but members to be present he and calling a hackney coach drove off perflattering himself that his incognito had not w penetrated for although his countenance had tantly recognised still nothing was said to jmate that

seem casual wayfarers and strangers to each other at a wayside publichouse whilst they are biding their time until squire germans dishonest footman shall convey the appointed signal that all is ready a ponycarriage containing two ladies and a servant boy calls at the little inn the vision of the young lady brings all reubens good aspirations to a crisis he falls desperately in love with her at

missvings at the coincidence and follows to help em in case of need he arrives almost too late for he finds the ladies in deadly terror they have been robbed of all their valuables ana their unfortunate servant has been half killed by a man whom reuben from their description recognises as his companion he had made off on hearing some one approach reuben has the satisfaction of convoying the ladies home and calming their fears reuben resolves that the one burglary to which he stands pledged shall be his very last and that henceforth he will be an honest man the burglary at squire germans is successfully committed though the robbers have a narrow escape owing to the treachery of the footman their accomplice but they do escape and with a fabulous amount of booty reuben surrenders the whole of his share on condition of receiving the articles which had been stolen from the ladies and the promise of his companion never to claim his acquaintance he then formally takes leave of the  cross purposing henceforth to live entirely  on the square reuben naturally gravitates to the house of the ladies whom he has assisted in their distress  to restore their property is the

pleasant manners and agreeable conversation he sings too with a wonderful rich voicesongs from norma and other operas reuben is a thief of genius but he haa lived all his life with flash company and

the neighbourhood makes an attempt to break into the house believing the ladies to be rich and their house defenceless little dreaming that reuben is their guest reuben of course knows exactly what

moment of deadly temptation but he resists it and shows a good and generous nature his old companion will not profit by it he tries to kill reuben and there is a struggle in which reuben is hurt and his adversary receives a wound of which he dies which is a piece of great luck for reuben as it relieves him of a dangerous enemy and starts him with great eclat on the road of honesty but the past cannot be severed from the present at every turn he is met and baffled by some accident arising from his old life he keeps up a manful fight against all his difficulties he has friends in the maxwells and in a worthy old doctor who is their friend and the guardian of miss maxwell reuben shows many excellent qualities in fact he is so truthful and straightforward that it is difficult to understand how he had ever prospered in his old career of thief and rogue he however mars many of his chances by impatience at the last moment which destroys the good of all he had done and suffered but though often defeated in his efforts to earn an honest living he never relapses into bad courses having enlisted as a soldier he does his duty well but an experienced thief has by ill luck enlisted in the same regiment his thefts are laid to the charge of reuben and though he is cleared from them the malignity of his comrade reveals the secret of his previous life the tyranny of his superior officer finishes what thisrevelation had begun reubens temper fails he returns a blow which his officer had given with a cane this grave offence he aggravates by an unsuccessful attempt to escape from arrest things would have gone very hardly but for a romantic discovery of his parentage  as it is he nearly frustrates all attempts to befriend him but in the end his sentence is commuted to four years penal servitude and he is to be sent out ofthe country his friends new and old stand by him at the last and the book ends with the promise of miss maxwell to join him as soon as his sentence will permit and become his wife beginning with him a new life in a new world as reuben is still very young there is a fair prospect of years before him in the main subject of the story in the discovery of his father and in the final destiny of the hero the reader will be reminded of sir bulwer lyttons paul clifford the management of the story is however altogether different from that novel but in both cases we would warn romantic readers against expecting to find reuben poleworthy and paul clifford in the general run of even penitent thieves,war_contra

  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering has secretly loved her but he has exchanged into a regiment going to india to put himself out of the reach of temptation georgie has a cousin ida who is engaged to be married to another of the four friendsthe rev geoffrey

madly in love with dering georgie has a narrow escape from the pranks of a vicious horse which she has wilfully insisted on mounting maurice dering saves her there is a capital description of the  race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief there is a certain gerald annesley a handsome blackguard who has known georgie in former times and who has stirred the first romantic feelings of her heart he renewb acquaintance with her and ida sets herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lovely face the lovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or

miriam or the power of truth a jewi8h tale by the author of  influence eighth edition 12mo pp 388 london 1845 hatchard and co a eighth edition of a fiction proves that it must possess some at least of the qualifications for popularity and that implies the presence of characteristics that appeal to our common nature and therefore proceed from sincerity of purpose in the writer miriam is a religious tale written with a distinct and avowed purpose and this may be one cause of its great success but that alone would not have carried it through eight editions and we find in fact that it is interesting in its story and eloquent in its language and though to us it ap pears to be too much amiplified and might be improved by the curtailment of many of the dialogues and descriptions and the omission of some obtrusive reflections and sermonizing still to other tastes this has proved to be no objection and success is a fair test of fitness to please the public,war_contra

fates a fiddler by edwin george pinkham boston  small maynard 6s there are other fiddlers in the world besides fatemr pinkham the author of the present work for example in plain words mr pinkham exhibits a tendency to fiddle so curiously in the matter of his style that from the outset of this story he repells rather than attracts one we quote the opening of chapter i in a district of boston that had just taken upon itself metropolitan honours in the basement front of a staid brick dwelling of the description inhabited at one time by the solid merchants of the town but now exhibiting ahopeless breaking out of the professional sighs of secondclass attorneys furniture brokers and painless dentists and at the corner of the street adjacent to a spot historic in american annals what i have to tell of myself has its unheroic beginning i first became conscious of my small self there at about the time when my head was level with the windowsill looking up through the grimed panes at the feet of the passing population just visible with mighty little leg through the narrow space between the top of the window and the level of the sidewalk in spite of this trick of elaborate diction however our author manages to put together a distinctly interesting if somewhat mild story and he introduces us to a number of characters who though sufficiently american are not agressively or distressingly so but we are afraid that on the whole the story will not make any great impression upon english readers,war_contra

the quest of ledgar dunstanw m1r sheppard has followed up  the rise of ledgar dunstan  by a sequel and sequels are challenging things those who read the previous story will be prepared to find that this begins with a honeymoon and ends with one the hero obviously married the wrong woman and he was not long in finding out his mistake mlary used awfully too often and when a husband on his honeymoon begins to calculate that if he and she live for twenty years she will have dinned his ears with that word nearly three hundred thousand times when he an author learns from his beloved that george washington discovered america that tennson wrote in memorandum and that dr johnson was hare ben the elements of a social tragedy are not far away especially when the young lady discovers her affinity with a young american art student who boxes better than her husband so mlary deserts him and dunstan is left stranded he attempts to exchange personalities with a wretched creature u ho commits suicide in his lodgings at paris then he marries winnie his soulmate and the book ends with some piomise of happiness for both mr sheppard again makes play with the psychology of lunatics this time with the confessions of a being who believes he is antichrist incarnate there are a number of clever and penetrating things in the book but it is not particularly artistic in form the account of dunstan in paris smacks of balzac and the story of the heros conversion it conversion it can be called in a nonconformist london chapel has echoes also though it is skilfully managed but the rambling chaotic philosophy which is spread over the middle part of the book does not hold the reader who hurries on to catch mr sheppard observing life and drawing character both of which he can do briskly when he forgets to be rearranging the universe we should have liked for example to have had more about mary who develops wonderfully after she leaves dunstan winnie does not compensate for her predecessor the book closes with her listening to dunstan reading balzac after tea on the day they had been married and remarking oh ledgar the world is so kind  it is soothing in these days of strife to hear such a note struck but it is not heroic even though winnie lit a cigarette before she sat down on a hassock to listen to the story it is in analysis and imaginative power particularly on the side of the religious temperament that mr sheppard is strong his second story of dunstan so far confirms the impression made by the first there is less humour perhaps in the sequel than in its predecessor but one odd fact is mentioned which may be new to some readers the ruthless mary asked her husband to put his hands on the table and clasp one over the other interlocking the fingers it seems that if you close the left hand over the right you are a weak person mary herself always put the right over the lelt jaames moffatt  the rise of ledgar dunstan this is a long book but it only leaves the hero on the evening of his marriage and we are informed that a sequel entitled  the quest of ledgar dunstan  is to follow a reviewer is neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet but he predicts that the sequel will have something to do with the present war meantime ledgar dunstan is set before us from childhood onwards it is a novel on the arnold bennett plan describing the rise of the hero from an ugly nonconformist household into comparative prosperity his literary and social interests his opinions on life in general his failure to win the heart of one girl and his marriage to another mr sheppard writes with some sense of humour he tells a story well though not always very accurately he has a vivid eye for the cruelty and mystery of life as a young man sees it he piles episode on episode hurries over some as for example the schooldays elaborates others inartistically as for example the visit to the lunatic asylum but invariably he is interested in the world of men and things and he manages to convey this interest to his readers it is like a first book the author has not learned to select and reject one thing after another is thrown in page after page of opinions on art religion and society but these faults of construction are carried off by the abounding vitality of the writer and if he learns to prune his words and ideas in the sequel isle will achieve a real success as it is lie has written a book that is often delightful and more than once penetrating in its criticism of life it shows force and freshness of thought and a power of expression which gives good promise of more mature work to come when the author realises that people dont quote poetry at length in conversation and that it is a mistake to fill pages with abstract discussions upon philosophy and art in the form of monologues the clue or one of the clues to ledgar dunstans character is suggested in the description of his iit to the theatre ndl coiicln and

played when he wvas born  in this volume the tragedy is still undeveloped but there is a hint of it we do not feel that the handsome aristocratic mary beltinge has won his heart he is not soundly in love with her and indeed it looks as if he could not abandon himself to the lovepassion truly still mir sheppard only suggests this he has plenty to do in this volume with unbaring dunstans crude eager puzzled outlook upon life and he rightly brings out the humour rather than the complication and troubles of such a temperament as his hero was possessed of one of his friends who had theories about education proposed to hang up in every nursery a card with this motto you are upside down everything in the wvorld is upside down learn to stand on your head dunstan is busy through this book in discovering the truth of that motto it amuses him annoys him and helps to stimulate him mir sheppard does manage to make all this interesting to his readers and the novel is a distinct success of its kind there is stuff in it to make the reader think as well as laugh ji a  the rise of ledgar dunstan by a t sheppard duckworth 6s here is an amazing novel which in construction and matter is daring and original mr sheppard owes nothing to anybody he is as a man who has spent his lifetime in the observation of life he has set himself out to give a detailed account of ledgar dunstan there is little left unsaid but however trivial the incidents recorded when heaped up they give us a monumental picture of a man dunstan is the son of baptist tradespeople and his evolution is minutely described until the time he is a successful novelist and weds mary beltinge there the tale ends with the intimation that it will be followed by another of which the war and antichrist are the themes

byandbye john once more turned his thoughts towards matrimony for himself  that john butly should feel disposed to marry again does not seem so extraordinary john had married youngwas a young fatherand as he truly said the relative ages of himself and helen had in some degree alleviated the grief which he felt for the loss of her mother by placing her in the position of mistress of his house at a somewhat premature age perhapsbut there she wasand as he vainly endea soured to impress upon jacobs mindthere was female society he had been a sort of male cojuette dl h life ed loved dangling at fiftyfour as miuch as he did when he was less than half that age and it is astonishing perhaps not because the case is so common that a habit of that sort does not wear off with time as might be expecled the man of fiftyfour flirts and is not ill received but he does not appre ciate the mode of his reception he does not feel himself much older than he was fiveandtwenty years before he scarcely aees an alteration in his own persion all that be wonders at is the extraordinary flippancy and forwardness of boys of liveundtwenty forgetting that when he was of that age he considered an old fellow of fifty four a  regular nuisance wonderful however have been the changes in society within the last half century  the march and influence of age have been neutralised to an extent which

complicated and delicate loveentanglements are discussed in public honoria a wilful irish beauty who grows up into a most wicked woman falls jealously in love with morgan oneil a fascinating irish youth and openly declares war to the knife with nesta olacy an irish heiress also bewitched by the hero morgan oneil prefers honoriain fact can never love any one elsebut she becomes such a cruel coquette that he breaks their engagement and allows himself to be married to nesta who is dying for love of him and who compels an excellent lord mowbray to whom she is all but betrothed to give her up and to fetch this most fascinating of morgans to her feet the above is the merest outline of some among the improbabilities of the prologue the details are in keeping there is a divine eva dromore an irish clergymans daughter who becomes attached to morgans brother henry there is a wonderful aunt mary an authoress who breakfasts with rogers and goes to lansdowne house lives in a tower favours

not further draw ont the list of characters having to consider  the heiress and her lovers from another point of view lady chatterton has not aimed at producing a tale of mere fashionable lifeof

his wife looking on helplessly from a distance nesta having ascertained henrys innocence insists without her husbands knowledge that an old relation of his who has an enormous fortune to bequeath and who desires to have a male successor should leave it to the virtuous not the vicious nephew this is done when up turns morgan again and by aid of another murder gets the document out of the way after the old mans death and thus cheats hi brother of the property a male heir had been manufactured as follows  morgan as we have told had always been in love with honoria who had married a rich old lord

at the same time to exchange his and nestas daughter for his and honorias bastard honoria of course hates her putative child and letitia is neglected and much illtreated though honourably beloved by a gifted son of henry and eva and loving him in return she is on mercenary considerations committed by honoria to the tender mercies of a reprobate lord blandon by an artifice which savours in its genteel way of the coarse days of sophy western and lord fellamar but let no one be afraid a delugerather say a thunderstormof poetical justice desoends on the last pages of the story morgan eressed

notes on novels these notes on the weeva fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow tne roman road by zack three stories by the author of on trial the scene of the first which occupies half the book is laid at a country house in the village through which ran the roman road passing among the dilapidated cottages it  seemed to image forth life triumphant over disease and failure the story opens with a conversation in which the owner of groot hall by his mothers confession finds that he ia not the rightful heir but like the roman road his life emerged from failure the symbolism of the story is insistent throughout constable 6s  the roman road by zack 6 coastable and co the three stories which make up the book suffer from the same mistake that of a want of claritv the roman road is distinctly the clearest of them but even in that vagueness descends like a thick fog towards the end ard why the hero and heroine should finally run hand in hand helpless as children down the roman road is a fact quite beyond the reach of any available explanation the tale called the thoughtv ones is however perhaps the most incomprehensible of them all it is a story about children and here and there is illuminated by delightful touches of a convincing naturalness hut these are brief and from beginning to end the reader has not the least idea what the author is driving at what the whole thing is about what the children have really done or what is intended bv the ending when hoisting sail the thoughty ones sailed awav out beyond the other ships just the thought ones the boat and the feeling and not a soul beside did they ever come back or were they drowned and was the unfortunate little sister whose black velvet frock they had torn up for flag left to tell this sequel to their previous mysterious adventures  or were these children capable mariners t1 whom the manipulation of a sailing boat on the open sea was a simple business and did they after a pleasant jaunt come home to an ample tea the answer can at the best only be guesswork both in  the thoughts ones  and  the balance the central idea is too obscure to be easily comprehensible  fiction shadowy psychology the roman road by zack constable cs there was a time when zack seemed set upon a kind of hard realism in two of the three stories which make up this volume she has abandoned realism for psychology lt is a curious and rather unsatisfactory psychology neither objective nor subjective but mingling both to make an impression strong indeed but without much real human appeal only one character in  the roman road  is alive and that is a minor character the others stand for types evolved rather than studied detached from rather than linked to life we do feel the actuality of the miserable village which makes a sinister background to the story but we can get no grip of the mother and the two sons who hold its destiny nor of the girl who ia so mechanically employed for the purposes of contrast and a reasonably happy ending the mother with her scruples of conscience and her angina pectoris does not move us neither does the favourite son who at first elects to keep his brother out of his own these people are good enough ideasthey have been used in fiction scores of times and will be used scores of times againbut the author does not carry us with her her comments are on too high a note when roland is considering his position we read he looked across the wall towards the rotting village and wished that though foul thing would get swallowed up by the foul marsh into which it gaped it imaged forth a very smallpox of dishonour and contact with it set thc soul itching to scratch out her own beauty that is overdone almost strident and certainly strained in expression the passage might have fallen into place if the man roland lived for us but he does not he exists indeed merely as a stalkinghorse for clever and often bitter comment much of the work in the story is technically excellent and it is charged with the writers personality but as art related to life it fails the second story called  the balance is even more remote frankly treated as allegory it would have been more effective richard eastone of the unhappy stained victorious writer types dear to fictionis again merely an idea once he touches us in his nursing of the dying child but even there the borders of true sentiment are almost overpassed the child is as unreal as dickenss sick children in his worst moods and just where some touch of realism might have saved richard from being a shadow we find only generalisations the lurid evil which overhangs the man like a cloud is too phantasmal to stir the emotions and as a consequence his relations with the woman of the story leave us unmoved the dialogue in both these stories draws nothing from nature it is rhetorical hard bitter clever but never instinct with human modulations yet  the roman road is a book that dwells in the memory by reason of its unquestionable cleverness and moral earnestness the writers attitude towards life would be difficult to defineperhaps it is mainly rebellious with a reaching out after beauty and an acute though rather narrow understanding of it there is no broad outlook no appreciation of the human comedy no quiet contemplation of a world which after all is not without exquisite compensations and strengthening silences the concluding story which deals with children seems to us to suffer from the same faults it has imagination and strength but neither joy nor tenderness at the same time we believe that miss keats is a real and a sincere artist let her cease to evolve and begin to observe let her cease to worry and begin to contemplate and we have faith that an actual book would result the authors equipment is far beyond the average it only needs direction and a careful pruning,war_contra

fiction pastorals of dorset by  m e francis jliongmans 6s to the best of our knowledge mrs blundells previous novels and tales have dealt with north of england folk at least those of her books that we have read were set in the north and here she is in dorsetshire well we like her better in the south than we did before but whether it is because she is better or because dorsetshire people are more to our mind than those of lancashire and yorkshire we cannot determine the fact remains that this is a very entertaining book very slight may be but rich in quiet humour and appreciation of human natures quaintness it is also topical for mrs blundell has more than one story bearing on the war including that perfect thing for a reciter  how granger volunteered which is worth a thousand of the ordinary narratives that are delivered from platforms the impact of the war on english village life is after all as well worth recording as its progress or want of progress at what is called the front a rustic argus is also a capital story extremely well told mr hardy has for so long abstained from adding to his company of humorous dorset villagers they have latterly all had seriousness before anything that mrs blundells sketches are the more welcome a most companionable and kindly book,war_contra
english episodes by frederick wedmore elkin mathews three of these five episodes are imaginative pieces of that high class of whioh mr frederick wedmores yvonne of croisio and a chemist in the suburbs  were previous examples a reader without imagination might regard them as pleasant stones but if he saw no more in them than the meagre incidents they record he would miss their essential charm mr wedmore describes the whole five as imaginative pieces i confess that the second and third of the number seem to me to belong to quite another category in the second a swindler from new south wales runs up a big hotel bill whioh he does not pay and trifles with the affections of the landladys daughter in the third a small tradesman disappears from his home causes his wife and family to believe that he has been drowned and takes another name and lives with another woman a few miles off these are perhaps true episodes of eaglish life as also of life not englishbut no imagination was needed for their conception or could fitly be employed upon their treatment well enough in their place they do not deserve the refinements of style whioh mr wedmore bestows upon them having said this i have no other word of deprecation to offer indeed the three pieces that remain possess quite enough merit to atone for the undesirable proximity of the two others these three have nothing in common except the quality which makes each of them excellent love is more or less the theme of all three but the aspect differs in each instance in  the vicar of pimlico  the tender passion is peculiarly tender it dawns upon the still youthful heart of a middleaged clergyman rather as a mild suffusing flame than as a consuming fire and it oomes in the person of a young girl who first interests him by the unsophisticated grace of her presence and the modest frankness of her nature it is a new experience to the middleaged man who does not in fact realise that it is an experience until pursuing the rule of his life he finds that there is something he must put away if he would maintain that single devotion to his work whioh makes for him the sum of duty but this putting away is not done without a pathetic effort one felt inolioed to question at first whether he should have written the letter in which he told millicent sergison that he loved her but that he was not for her nor she for him mr wedmore however is right it could not hurt millicent it could hardly fail to raise her selfrespect to know that such a man had loved her the very declaration of his feeling was a benediction if disappointment came with the knowledge that there was to be no tie and no further communication between them it would not be a lasting shadow for she was only twenty and youth has a time of conquest before it  the new marienbadelegy is a sort of converse to this study of renunciation in middleage of the young love that might have been won here we have an amiable dilettantea poet and lover of artwho goes to buxton to get cured of an attack of gout which his nonappointment to the laureateship has aggravated at buxton the charms of sylvia rawson gradually steal upon his somewhat coddled affections and he finds that there is a possibility of joy in life with which the delight of producing immortal verse or the rapture a perfect etohing may excite cannot compare but sylvia remains placid and unmoved and it turns out that she has had her time of love and that for her the dream has passed the third piece  katherine in the temple is much slighter than the other two and in a different vein from eaoh of them but it is as true as human as idealised as they it is his power of idealising and the delicate effects he produces which give distinction to most of mr wedmores work you are sensible of an atmosphere in whioh the refinements of life expand and flourish an atmosphere too highly rarefied to sustain the coarser forms of experience the subtleties of a dainty style are very winning in this book one sometimes feels in reading mr wedmore that the sentences ate too riohly laden for a structure of so delicate a character sentence within sentence and parenthesis within parenthesis carry what for the moment seems too full a largess of good things but one would not have it otherwise these elaborations are like the facets on a gemthey give colour and brilliancy the colour is abundant how well it comes out in such a passage as this sylvia rawsonit is difficult to describe her except by saying that she would give warmth and dignity to any landscape you placed her in she has almost everythingcolour expression and though not absolute faultlessness a singular distinction of form tall erect supple now walks with energy now lounges largely like an albert moore warm and full her eyes deep grey her cheek brown and rosecolour her hair brownish gold beauty and the supreme beauty of health the wind and the sunshine have done if for the nature tb at was made for them among the numerous other passages i have marked here is one which contains an admirable wedmoresque theory of what is best in woman elle est tris femmelikes to be liked rejoices modestly in her good looks her freshness and her vigour holds by the old ways wlives in god aud man looks out with reverence on the unsolved mystery of the great beyond would you have her different pow one compares her with that other type the product of the lopsided education of the middleclass and of the modern prosperity of citiesa type shallowly learned through theories and books angular bloodless spectacled

because it is itself an eulogy she is of her own sexof her own sex entirely elle est tree femme certainly these three english episodes are worthy successors of mr wedmores pastorals and renunciations and with them should represent a permanent addition to the literature of the generation george cotterell  ii  inglish episodes by frederick wedmore 3s 6d elkin mathews mr wedmore has a genre of his own at least no one else in england attempts the same kind of thing on not very outoftheway types of characters he bestows minute care and analysis and having made his observations he sets down the result in fastidiously simple language his aim is evidently to look at each of his characters through the eyes of one similarly situated and if he is not always successful in this if the very cultivated critic and theorist of life be occasionally audible in the tones of his comments the fault is artistically pardonable because the aim is a difficult one besides it gives a certain personal interest to the stories and indeed with his more commonplace or at least humbler personages he has in this volume been singularly successfulwith mr salting who migrated to camden town and another mnenage when the surrey side and his monotonous domestic prosperity there had bored him unendurably and with the aerated bread shop katherine but  the vicar of pimlico is the best piece of workmanship by far readers may not be convinced that the reasons were good which kept the vicar a bachelor but they cannot but admire the subtle manner in which he is presented he is the type of the cultivated clergyman of the day alive to the needs of the hour yet with strong links of sympathy to the past but by reason of certain delightful individual traits he is a personage far more than a type mr wedmores work is throughout fine in texture and delicate in tone and we are glad to see it winning the wide recognition it has long merited,war_contra
cathalmore or selflove and selfcontrol by arami 2 vols 8vo shoberl great marlborough street the writer  a dispensary doctor in an outoftheway part of ireland has here given to the world an episode in the life of a celtic squire not one of that select and possibly very respectable body who for some strange reason delight in prefixing the definite article to their patronymics but an ordinary mortal to wit one cathal more of cappagh house we presume in the county of mayo the period embraced in the narrative is the interval between december 1844 and july 1851 it purports to be a recital of actual occurrences and the characters introduced upon the scene we are assured are all drawn from life the second title to this work appears to us not to have been happily selected the principal deduction from the history before us as we apprehend being nothing more than that it is highly inexpedient for a landed proprietor to allow an unitarian to build a chapel on his estate from such a cause was it that most of the misfortunes d tailed in these volumes arose mr more and his mother we are informed had for a length of time exerted all their best energies in the management of their extensive territorial possessions and the amelioration of their tenantry on a stormy night in december 1844 their hospitality was solicited by two travellers whose carriage had broken down near the entrance to the domain the strangersfather and sonof the name of schelling were pressed to pass a few days at cappagh  they became acquainted with the rector of the parish mr hyde and his daughters catherine and agnes the individuals thus brought together make a series of agreeable excursions together in the vicinity from the conversations that ensue on these and other occasions we are led to infer that mrs more was a sensible intelligent old lady somewhat bigoted in her persuasions but sincere and amiable in every relation of life impressive eloquence she was in form a slight withered old woman worn by care and thought grave and gentle in her manner generally silent but when she chanced to speak of a topic interesting to her she became calmly but impressively eloquent one did not perceive the power of her words at the moment of their utterance but they left a deeper afterimpression than such orators as i have heard speak ever produced on me the charm was given to them by her wise life devoted to the cause of truth and her hearty faith in her own sincerity for these are the cornerstones of eloquence on which indeed it is good to erect an arch of wellsounding words out without which for foundation the finest edifice of language will be but an unsafe height to both the speaker and the hearer even her silence was  eloquent reposethe eloquent repose of lifes sunset glowing in the softened brightness that succeeds a burning day during which much good work in the vineyard has been done mr schelling was of german origin and the prejudices of his country biassed his theories and seemed in some measure to account for the strong belief he entertained in mesmerism a mysterious agent which according to him accounted for all that seems to ordinary people inexplicable in the mysteries which hourly occur around them he was moreover an enthusiastic unitarian losing on no occasion an opportunity of diffusing the principles of the creed to which he belonged anxious to carry out his plans of benefiting his poorer neighbours cathal more had made many ineffectual efforts to raise a large sum of money upon a mortgage of his estates mr schelling learning this and being a man of great wealth offered at once to advance the money upon condition of mr mores countenancing the erection of a unitarian chapel on his land after considerable hesitation mr more accepts the proffered boon the unitarian furnishes 20000 at four per cent upon mortgage of the cappagh estates and in due course the chapel is erected it was admitted to be a really beautiful edifice in the early english style and the architect neglected no means of appealing to the love of beauty inherent in human nature as he proceeded with his work the little edifice however no sooner received the last finishing touches of the mason than it excited the pious horror and roused the indignation of the vicinity a mr ludwig heinser is appointed the officiating minister and he spares no endeavour to obtain a congregation though all his efforts prove ineffectual to secure proselytes to his cause mr hyde the rector strongly reprobating the conduct of mr more in the business sternly refuses to visit at his house until the obnoxious structure is closed or removed cathal more himself is at length induced to view his own conduct in the light in which it is regarded by his friends and determines to undo the mischief which he is persuaded origiginated with himself heinser in his endeavours to aid his sinking cause becomes implicated in the rebellious proceedings of 1848 and only escapes conviction through the generous interposition of mr more meanwhile mr schelling becomes seriously discomposed at the turn affairs are taking and at the manifest failures of his attempts to fill the chapel on which so much outlay had been lavished nor are his annoyances diminished when he learns that his only son after a long illness and shortly before his death bad abandoned the creed of his father for that of protestantism the fathers curse he said not a word to any of us but he walked straight to where his son sat by the window rupert had sprung up to meet him when he entered but he had not time to advance before his father holding out a paper to bim asked him sternly what he meant by what he had written it was the letter that his son had sent four days before announcing his adoption of our faith lam sorry he began retract it instantly interrupted mr schelling  i see what means have been used to kidnap you he went on looking round at us  but before their faces you shall retract he spoke between his teeth and his words grated through them with a malignity of tone i never heard equalled my father said rupert who seemed to gather courage when his father spoke so roughly to him  ask what else you will and i will obey but not in this matter  i cannot retract  at peril of a fathers curse at peril of beggary at peril of ruining these people whom you call your friends will you refuse p asked mr schelling still maintaining a forced quiet of manner though he grew livid with the effort  so help me god i must said rupert firmly  so help you god repeated his father sneeringly  for you will need his help but now hear me rupert schelling and may the echo of my words never cease in your ears i curse the hour you were born your life and death your name and your religion i cast you off for ever except to injure you and those you love and as these friends of yours here are dear to you they shall be the first to suffer he threw his sons letter on the ground and grinding it with his heel he turned and left the room as abruptly as ho had arrived  rupert dear rupert all will be well you have done well said mrs more to the unfortunate young man who had sunk on the sofa i went towards him and lifted one of his cold damp hands it was dropping with blood and already a little pool had formed on the cushion under his head he had broken ono of the larger bloodvessels and the red lifestream was welling from his mouth mr schellings proceedings towards the more family after his sons death evince the most decided hostility the origin of which feeling we are subsequently informed is attributable to lonsubsisting jealousy the loan from schelling to mr more is attended with the ordinary resultsthe foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the cappagh estate and the personal effects of the owner at this painful juncture however a true friend appears in the person of major wyndham who plays a prominent part in the narrative and who at the momentous crisis to which we have alluded purchases for mr more not only the cappagh house and park but the pictures and furniture endeared by former associations mr more marries one of mr hydes daughters and determines to  become a real working man and practical improver instead of an idle country gentleman he demolishes the obnoxious unitarian temple and erects upon the site a cross on which are engraved these words  in this place i cathal more of carragh built a unitarian chapel this cross witnesses my repentance july ad 1851 mr schelling disappointed in his schemes of vengeance and under a threat from heinser that he will disclose certain fraudulent transactions in which they have been engaged commits suicide  thus dramatic justice is satisfied such is a brief indication of the history of cathal more assuming that it is not a work of fiction there is certainly not much in it to criticise the authors style is simple and unpretending though some of his observations indicate both thought and reflection still we do not apprehend that this his first literary production is calculated to awaken much interest out of his own immediate circle if on the other hand cathal more be a work of the imagination it certainly will not attain much popularity among those who occasion the principal demand for such books and whose appetite requires a more exciting pabulum than they will find provided here our readers will observe that in accordance with our invariable practice we have abstained from entering into the religious part of the question but we have never before heard that the sect to which the author so

fiction the new novels gertrude or familiy pride a novel by mrs i trollopi  3 los london  hurst and  blackett percy blake or thie young rifleman by capt riuftma author of  tl e g uards c 3 vols i london hurst and blackett love versus money a novel 2 vols london saunders and otley  pride subdued by lovea maiden stooping from her high sphere to love a man much below her in i social rank thus acknowledging the supreinacy of intellect over all external distinctionsis al old theme for poet novelist and dramatist and though perpetually reproduced never wanting in interest if only a little ingenuity be employed to vary the form of the story but inexhaustible a its interest proves to bepleasant as it is to i read and dream of distinctions of social rank vanishing before natures equality of intellect which has its own nobilityyet it is verydoubtful if as a sober matter of fact such unions ever result in happiness though novelists do not recognise the truth that the highest intellect is part of a mind composed of passions and weaknesses and lodged in a body which has its appetites and demands its indulgencesin real life that truth soon makes itself felt and domestic life stripped of its romance is dependent for its comfort upon family friendship or hostility quite as much as upon competency of fortune it is lamentable to think that lofty intellect will be sorely discomfited if the leg of mutton is underdone that love  which tempests never shook  will cool at the sight of a milliners bill that the goddess must be seen in curlpapers and the idol of the romance in a dressingown and slippersprobably peaked with a red nightcap agreeing therefore with mrs trollope that unequal love is a capital theme for fiction we are bound to say that if it ends in an unequal marriage it is a very bad thing in reality and we hope that it will not be encouraged by the example of gertrude undoubtedly the wondrous diffusion of wealth hrs done much to destroy social distinctions the barriers that used to divide ranks are not absolutely impassable as formerly but they are still hard to be leaped democracy has tried to throw them down but the attempt has failed utterly by a curious revulsion of feeling nowhere are they more rigidly maintained than in democratic countries in the united states the social distinctions of classes are far more sedulously preserved than with us and among ourselves there is more repulsion among classes than in countries where the lines of demarcation are drawn by thelaw so it was in france the first demand of democracy was equality it was decreed by the law but was it obtained in fact bv no means classes only kept themselves still more aloof and to this day the nobles preserve their social rank intact though their political titles and power are wrested from them intellect alone crosses the barrier but even that does not accomplish it immediately the intellect of the man of inferior class is patronised courted used but it is not recognised as of equal rank gertrude is designed to illustrate the struggles between family pride and love ending in the triumph of the latter gertrude falls in love with her fathers secretary and marries him the interest of the story consists in the resolution with which through all trials and difficulties she remains faithful to her affection and resolute to her purpose and this is done without the sacrifice of any gernle trait of character which belongs to woman gertrude herself is a charming creation the best mirs trollope has produced the novel itself is wanting in one of the characteristics of her former most popular fictions there is no satire for the subject affords no field for it but it is in satire that mrs trollope is greatest that is her forte but let us do her this justice her satire is not illtempered it is the satire we admire and applaud in tliackeray and in puncha it has done good service in its time and if directed against the hypocrisies of our own day it would 1o good service again and we should heartily welcome the pen of mrs trollope to the exercise of its old functions gertrude has some clever scenes and some vivid sketches of character but we cannot help lamenting that the same power was not more usefully employed perry blake is the history of just such a lashing hero as might have been anticipatedt from capt rafters former exploits in heromaking and one who is sure to be extremely popular just now when the country has a military mania percy blake is a soldier whose adventures in love and war are equally daring

doubt the perfect disinterestedness of this  attachment in this manner lie proceeds mingling adventures in war with adventures in love through three volumes thronged with incidents some intensely exciting all interesting told with infinite spirit and with full knowledge of army life of which there are some brilliant sketches and sharing in the fatal walcheren expedition which is powerfully described and in the end he returns and marries the little cousin to whom he had sworn constancy at the beginning of the talehis heart let us hope nothing the worse for having been desperately in love with a dozen other women in the mean while it is a novel that will pleasantly beguile the evenings now growing long although in two volumes only lovee versus money is quite as long as the ordinary novel in three volumes if not longer so closely is it printed here too the title indicates the subject only instead of rank struggling with love as in gertrude we have love in conflict with money but the author of this latter novel has not mrs trollopes capacity for constructing a story nor her experience in the art of telling it an unpractised pen is visible in these pages but nevertheless there is promise in it some of the characters are truthfully conceived and drawn with considerable ability lote versus money is an irish story of the latter part of the 18th century and the author has carefully studied the history manners and characteristics of the period in which the scene is laid his principal fault is verbosity the characters declaim too much a dialogue should always advance the story or illustrate the character it should never be introduced for the mere purpose of filling up the pages in real life persons do not talk a whole page in one sentence that is not dialogue but declamation it is also a fault to be too minute in description something should be left for the imagination an instance of this fault is at page 96 in the first volume where nearly two pages are devoted to some tokens of affection offered by mrs ihardforth to eve this is only one example of many we name them because the author has abilities which cultivated and corrected might make him eminent  gertrude or family pride by mis trollope london hurst and blackett 1855 mrs trollope is an indefatigable caterer to the appetite of the novelreading public her tales do not follow each other it is true with the same rapidity as those which emanate from the fruitful brains of m g p r james or alexandre dumas but she has written quite enough and has been read quite enough to establish her claim to rank among the most popular circulatinglibrary romancists of the last quarter of a century we fancy however that her popularity must have been rather on the wane lately  for even the least thinking of novel readers have begun to doubt the good taste and good feeling of many of the books which they would have read a few years since without any such misgiving the affectations ot the silverfork school and the easy goodhumoured and rather clever vulgarity of the sect of which our authoress was once the prominent teacher have alike ceased to please even the uncritical class for whose edification their works were mainly written the  highmoralpurpose school now lias it all its own way and because thoughtful minds such as kingsleys mrs gaskells and poor miss bronteshave treated either directly or indirectly in their powerful fictions some of the great social questions which divide the world every one who now sits down to compose a novel thinks it necessary first of all to select a moral to which the story shall be appended or a high purpose to which it shall be rendered subservient even mrs trollope has forsaken what we for a long time considered her special and favourite walk of literature she has discarded the lowcomedy style of her earlier works with its broad fun and unrefined humour and not only uims at giving us in exchange the very genteelest of comedies but when her piece is over and the author withdrawn behind the curtain she comes forward with a moral by way of epilogue but there is a revolution dearly beloved reader which is steadily at work among us the progress of which is not the less sure because its onward movement is neither vehement nor noisy we aro perfecuy well aware that prosperous commerce and successful industry will often cause so near an approach between the toe of the commoner and the heel of the noble as to run some risk of galling a kibe and this is a fact still more patent in our days than it was when the keenest of all observers first made the remark but true as the remark was then and more true as it is daily becoming by the eager onward movement of this successful industry there is another cause at work also which i believe is likely to become infinitely more effective in lessening the distances by which society is divided than any which acquired wealth can produce nor is the lessening social distance its only effect social distance may be lessened with very litue chance of producing any feeling of equality as its result but let thc barons von schwanberg who make though renl  almanach de goth  not my almanack their guidebook let all such keep a sharp lookout upon the species of free trade in intellect which is so very obviously threatening to set at nought the prohibitions of heraldic lawgivers the perils arising from a too close juxtaposition between longdescended rank and newly accumulated wealth aro as nothing when compared to the revolutionary intluenco of widely diffused education in proportion as that highest order of education which develops the thinking powers of human beings incomes general the effort to separate society into distinct social classes becomes more difficult the system of enlarged education which is so evidently gaining ground among us will do moro towards lessening the inequalities of rank than all the heralds will bo able to withstand titles were abolished in france yet no equality of condition ensued but let the son of a tinker bom with a powerful and healthful intellect have that intellect fully developed by education and the effort to keep him within the tinkering sphere will be as vain as the attempting to make a thoroughbred racehorse pass for a fitting bearer of a packsaddle our readers will we think agree with us that mrs trollope has scarcely acted with the shrewd sense which might have been expected from her in thus attempting to ape the  highmoralpurpose  school her philosophy besides its painful introduction by its head and shoulders is bad iu itself foolish and what the french call inconsequent in what country in the world has so gifted and accomplished a young tinker as she particularises ever failed to distinguish himself or to win the great prizes of life  in austria especially which she unluckily selects as the country where all rising genius is put down we all know from what class the ministers and counsellors of state are chiefly taken but the whole argumentif argument it can be calledis so weak as to make us regret that mrs trollope should have adopted a tone which looks so much like canta vice from which her former novels are glaringly free and which must be utterly uncongenial to her nature this is not the only change we find in this clever womans manner of thinking and speaking we all remember the somewhat truculent toryism which was wont to characterise her now her idea of a lively leaven to give grace and sprightliness to viennese society is a sprinkling of lansdownes so far so good but of what other lordly wits does the reader suppose carlisles  and lord johns   the scene of the story is laid in austria in the present day the baron von schwanberg is a monomaniac on the subject of rank and dignity and determines at his daughters suggestion who uses her fathers weakness for her own ends that the young baroness gertrude shall wed no one whose family is not allied even by marriage with the princely houses chronicled in the  almanach de gotha gertrude thus throws on her sire the onus of refusing unwelcome suitors of only noble blood her affections are already bestowed on a youth who saved her life when they were but boy and girl and whom her father to show his gratitude takes into the castlo as librarian of course there are the usual troubles and griefs to be overcome which ever beset lovers in novels her fathers conscut to her marrying a poor scholar of plebeian birth it would be madness to endeavour to obtain  so they marry privately a young bride in her secret smuggles her to vienna to be confined after which event she returns to her father with this friend who was confined in the same house and at the same time and who takes charge of gertrudes baby pretending that she herself has had twins the father dies afterwards blessing his daughter and tended by her and utterly unsuspecting her secret gertnide is not a pleasing heroine she ridicules her foolish and indulgent old father who loves her with a devotion approaching to fanaticism she deceives everybody around her and evinces on all occasions craft and cunning even in the matter of her religion she cannot be truthful and honest she conceals the new faith to which the fervour of mrs trollopes protestantism has made her convert all her austrian heroes and heroines without the intervention of any proselytising pastor and in defiance of all probability in like manner the excess of the authoresss rampant patriotism induces her to transplant all her favourite personnages to england though why they should leave the scenes endeared to them by unbrokenly happy associations we cannot pretend to divine the hero is much pleasanter than his ladylove and count adolphe gertrudes first rejected lover is better than either his countess is an englishwoman meant to be delightful and fascinating y w to us she appears somewhat flippant aud vulgar she talks of persons being  monstrous good and  monstrous pretty and backs all her opinions with a bet sometimes introduced playfully thus  will you bet nie a solid honest english sovereign i dont mean our wellbeloved queen but only one of lier beautiful little golden portraits mrs trollopes readers however will scarcely expect to find her ladies and gentlemen quite justifying their claims to that social distinction altogether we think that wo prefer her ancient coarseness to her present  gentility it was more natural and a great deal more funny and assuredly her new stylo is not a whit less vulgar we will quote one of the best scenes from this novelthat in which the young count adolphe tells rupert odenthal of his rejection by the old baron for want of a princely alliance in his pedigree   good day rupert were adolphes first words rupert nodded bis head in reply  i am cured rupert was adolphes second speech  the devil you are  was ruperts reception ol this uttered in a tone of dismay  how much the devil limy have to do with it my good friend i am not certain  but not much i should think for altogether the work is a good work and i am my own man again  explain dear adolphe explain  do you mean to say that you are no longer in love with the baroness gertrude  perhaps i begin to doubt if i ever was very much iu love with the daughter of our thricenoble neighbour perhaps you are right and that the fact of this unfortunate young ladys being the daughter of that insane old booby is and ought to be reason good against any one being in love with her  i never said so count replied rupert in a tone of indignation  i think her very charming and i know her to be very excellent but one cannotat least j cannotfall in love with the first pretty face and good young lady that one sees but this is all idle wandering do tell me and in an intelligible manner if you can what has happened to you  i will if j can replied the count  and the condition is but reasonable for how is a man to make that appear intelligible in relation which when it occurred had the very closest resemblance to a sort of obscure insanity  but wait a moment rupert and i will act the scene and this will give you a clearer idea of what has just passed than any narration of mine could donow then just sit you down there upon that fallen tree and i will sit down upon this one     you dont happen to have a book in your pocket do you rupert    the chances are in favour of it replied the young librarian laughing  you know my vocation count some of them generally stick to me if they happen to bc small and so saying he thrust his hand into his pocket and drew thence a miniature edition of  la fontaines fables  selected by fate on purpose to assist my exhibition  cried adolphe seizing it  only you must be pleased to fancy it a great deal more thick and a good deal more stumpy so now then remember if you please that you are the enamoured adolphe von steinfeld aud that i am the noble baron von scbwanberg  go on said rupert placing himself in the most touching altitude which the seat assigned him would permit and assuming an expression of countenance admirably calculated to suggest the idea of awmental struggle between love and reverence hope and fear  yes exclaimed adolph  that is the way i looked at iiiiuat least i hope sofor that is the way i intended to look but now mark me i flatter myself that you perceive at once my utter contempt and indifference for you and your looks my thoughts are here sir here iu this sacred little stumpy volume which is neither more nor less than than the  almanac h de gotha and thus i declare my will    no man shall ever marry my daughter with my consent whose family have not found a place here rupert sprung from ids pathetic attitude and indulged in a hearty burst of genuine laughter  are you in earnest count  he said when he recovered the power of speaking  most perfectly in earnest my dear friend replied adolphe  and now i presume he added that you will not wonder at my not wishing to delay my departure from the castle longer than was absolutely necessary  that you should wish to get out of his way if only to enjoy the laugh which i have enjoyed now i can easily understand  but not that you should so suddenly have recovered from your tender passion as to run away from the object of it  my dear rupert replied the young nobleman very gravely  i certainly think the baroness gertrude von schwanberg a very beautiful girl and moreover i have fancied right or wrong i scarcely know that she was more really intellectual and more capable of being a rational companion than any young lady i have yet seen    but be she what she may my good friend i would not take the daughter of that noble owl for my wife if she were ten times more beautiful and ten times more intelligent than i thought her when i galloped with a lovers speed towards schloss schwanberg this morning  you rather surprise me count adolphe replied rupert looking at him with very genuine astonishment  i must confess that i am except in theory extremely ignorant of such matters  but i certainly had fancied that a disappointment in love was a much more serious affair than you seem to make of it,war_contra

are so many spaces in the lines filled up with dots throughout the dialogue and the dtecription they have an ugly telegraphic look  flctlbtf napoleons love story by waclaw gamorowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth 6s we have read every word of this story with the greatest pleasure and interest and count de soissons claim in his brief introduction that gasiorowski though he does not bring into literature any new element is a very able master of the historical romance originated by sir walter scott is entirely justified the title alone seems a mistake napoleon either had no lovestory or he had a good many here we are concerned only with his brief passion or marie walewska a polish lady who was as good as she was beautiful and who belonged to that petite noblesse from which gasiorowski is himself sprung she bore the emperor a son alexandre walewski who afterwards became french ambassador at the court of st james represented france at the funeral of the duke of wellington and achieved a certain literary reputation he was a man with a heart of gold highminded and extraordinarily disinterested and it is evident to judge by this story that he inherited these qualities from his mother marie walewska married at twenty to a wealthy courtier of eighty conceived a romantic admiration for napoleon and the story depicts in the most moving and vivid manner her feelings when she begins to understand the real meaning of the emperors attentions that she yielded to him was a supreme act of selfsacrifice for she is led by the old polish statesman malachowski to believe that she will revive by her influence the fallen glories of her country she has a brother a humble lieutenant who learns of her shame which is at the same time the explanation of his sudden promotion to a colonelcy there is a dramatic scene between them not only does he cast her off but he throws in her face papers which contain damning proof of napoleons treachery to the polish cause to this succeeds a picture of quiet domesticity at schoenbrunn and then madame walewska is called to the deathbed of an old playmate of her childhood an officer named gorayski the emperor is bent on the austrian marriage and so a guilty colour is placed on the wholly innocent visit to gorayski and madame walewska is banished to poland not the least striking part of the book is her life when she returns to her aged husbands castle and the description of his reverential adoration of her baby son whom he always calls imperial highness we have had to pass over much that is admirable notably the scenes in paris the birth of the king of rome and the appearance of poor eleonore augier but we must mention the wonderful picture of polish society when napoleon first appears in warsawthe figures of talleyrand de segur duroc prince borghese davoust and many others mingling with the crowd of greedy courtiers and worldlywise women with whom madame walewskas native innocence and purity are strikingly contrasted yet the central allcompelling figure of the book is napoleon whether present or absent he is the determining force the masterspirit in whom every one is merged  napoleons love story by waclaw gasio rowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth  co m de soissons the translator of this romance of napoleon at warsaw tells us that the author is a napoleonic enthusiast so much may be gathered from the clear and vivid presentment of the fate of the virtuous and patriotic polish lady whose sorrows and betrayal at the hands of her ideal seem to evoke no contempt in the narrator to us it seems one of the meanest acts of one of the worlds great men poor mary walewska died for her enthusiasm  and in so doing only accentuated in her person the suffering entailed by the tyrant on the mass of her deluded countrymen the date is of course that of bonapartes presence in warsaw in 1807 when the revolutionary cloak had been abandoned and he was beginning to assimilate the pose of universal caesar the author a wellknown member of the school of sienkiewicz has given us a graphic study of polish society a century ago and the story though suffering to an english taste from rather too copious dialogue has many dramatic and some tragic passages while the characters especially that of the vain old courtier walewski are clearly cut the translation is well done but for a certain spasmodic method of conversation and a few slips of idiom,war_contra
david elginbrod by george macdonald 3 vols hurst  blackett this is a singular book and evinces talent in spite of the strange mystical notions which seem to pervade the mind of the author on the subject of mesmerism and electrobiology a nervous reader will be not a little startled at the supernatural influence which is obtained by the villain of the story over the rest of the characters and the ghost is one of the most appalling specimens of her species we have met with for a long time albeit she is explained away and softened down quite satisfactorily at last david elginbrod has in fact tory little to do with the rest of the story he is merely an old scotch bailiff of extraordi nary piety and intellect considering his rank in life being anxious to improve his mind he obtains the help of the tutor at the hall who lends him books and teaches him mathematics as david has a beautiful daughter who assists at these lessons and is herself an apt pupil mr hugh sutherland the young tutor soon spends his evenings habitually in davids cottage those who are not deterred by the scotch dialect from reading this portion of the story cannot fail to be struck by the simple and original remarks of the old scotchman and the pretty poetical ideas of  maggie my dor who inherits the talents and the goodness of her father the most interesting part of the book however is hughs residence at armstead an old mansion in surrey swarming with spirits and legends and mysterious sights and sounds  here mr sutherland has for his pupil a poor i nervous boy who seems at first to be half j witted but who has only been badly managed and who under a more healthy method of training becomes a most charming and affec tionate youth the little fables by which hugh gains harrys attention and wins him from his dreary old romances are full of poetry and beauty euphra is now the heroine of the tale she is harrys cousin and keeps house for her uncle mr arnold at first she seems inclined to feel some jealous distrust of the new tutor who so quickly makes harry love and obey him but sho soon changes her mind and begins to flirt with him instead she was not pretty but  most women in whom the soul has anything like a chance of reaching the windows are more or less beautiful in their best moments euphras best was when she was trying to fascinatethen she was fascinating during the first morning that hugh had spent at armstead she had probably been making up her mind whether between her and hugh it was to be war to the knife or fascination the latter had carried the day and was now carrying him but had she calculated that fascination may react as well against euphras wonderful dark eyes and her flattering tongue and clever artifices the poor country lad of a tutor had no chance at all he was not exactly in love with euphra  lie had believed himself to be devoted to maggie elginbrod and he saw a great deal in euphra to disapprove she was false and unfeeling in many ways he knew frivolous and selfishbut she pretended to admire him and flattery is very sweet and so euphra made hugh her slave in spite of all his better feelings under the plea of learning italian euphra next induced the tutor to neglect harry and to spend most of his time teteatete with her and as she chose to accompany the gentlemen in their walks and rides poor mr sutherland became in a manner bewitched and scarcely answerable for his own actions presently some new actors appear on the stagean old mrs elton a sick young  lady emily and their maid who is no other than maggie elginbrod again also a bohemian count suddenly arrives in the neighbourhood and gains an entrance into the house under the plea of being a friend of the tutors he being a clever scientific man and just to amuse the ladies after dinner offers to show them a few little experiments in electrobiology the result is terrific the chairs and tables dance about the room violently the plates having the end of a pencil stuck through their rims not only write but even spell correctly ghosts are seen in all directions rappings are audible at every door and window the servants are driven to the verge of distraction and lady emily takes to her bed partly out of bravado and partly out of curiosity hugh lays a wager with the bohemian that he will pass the night in the  haunted room the very headquarters of the ghosts and the description of the visitor who appeared there is enough to keep anybody who is the least inclined to be fastidious in these matters awake for a week after reading it still more wonderful the ghost seemed to be addicted to stealing and two valuable rings disappeared from hughs room in the course of this eventful night of course the ghost turns out to be nobody in the world but euphra and the rings are wanted by the bohemian for private purposes of his own he had contrived somehow or other to obtain mesmeric influence over euphra and had made that lady his unwilling tool one interview between them is so extraordinary that we transcribe it here she had been impelled by some irresistible impulse to go in her ghostly dress to meet the count in the ghosts walk and meeting margaret elginbrod she had fainted with fright thinking the real ghost had come to reproach her  when she recovered she found herself lying in the wood with funkelstein whom she had gone to meet standing beside her her first words were of anger as she tried to rise and found she could not  how long count halkar am i to be your slavetill you have learned to submit have i not done all i can  you have

power but you shall bo free notwithstanding and i will torture you till you yourselffind the ring the strangest part of this wild story is that the author treats all this as a commonplace everyday occurrence there is nothing apparently to be surprised at in count halkars power over euphra it is quietly explained as having been occasioned in the first instance by her own weakness some of my readers says mr mdonald may put euphra down as insane she may have been but for my part i believe there is such a power of one being over another though perhaps oidy in a rare contact of psychologically peculiar natures i have testimony enough for that she had yielded to his will once had she not done so he could not have compelled her but having once yielded she had not strength sufficient to free herself again whether even he could free her further than by merely abstaining from the exet cise of the power he had gained i doubt much here is a moral lesson to all ladies and

really is attached to him becomes a victim to shanie and remorse she has also dislocated her ankle which however by no means prevents her tyrant from causing her to meet him in the avenue whenever he wishes it though she is incapable on common occasions of putting her foot to the ground she comes to london and margaret who has also the power of mesmerizing though of course she uses it only for the best purposes insists upon euphra resisting the counts attraction  holds her down in bed catches her on the i stairs and carries her back by forceand sue j ceeds at last in releasing the wretched woman  from her painful bondage euphra in a state of clairvoyance finds out the counts hidingplace and describes it so accurately that hugh is enabled to trace him out and obtain the lost j ring euphra dies from the effects of her terrible struggle against the counts power and hugh marries margaret elginbrod this outline of a very absurd story does no justice to the many beautiful passages and descriptions contained in the book the characters are extremely well drawn  the pompous stiff old mr arnold the sensible plainspeaking mrs elton and the gentle lady emily all being sketches from the ufo and affording capital contrasts to the fantastic euphra and her mysterious master the bohemian hugh sutherland is a pleasing but not wise young man warmhearted and impulsive and therefore to

  belchambcr by howard overing stureris constable  co this is a long and leisurely novel discursive and ably written in the course of whioh we are introduced to a great many lifelike and unpleasant characters in the upper ranks of english society the hero is of a type not unfamiliar in modern fiction endowed with titles broad estates wealth and everything life can offer except robust physical health the son of a rigidly pious scotchwoman he is inclined to be morbid exaggerates the disadvantage of a slight lameness caused by an accident in boyhood takes life seriously and is keenly alive to the injustices of the present social system so far eo good and  sainty as lord belchamber is nicknamed wins the readers sympathy and regard by his gentle austerity and lofty ideals unfortunately the author falls into the error of overaccentuation and by aiming at strong effects impairs the truth of what might have been a telling piece of satire it is surely not likely that so many uncongenial and detestable people should crowd together around one unworldly life nor is it easily conceivable that a  marquis and earl of belchamber viscount charmington baron st edmunds and chambers who has been to eton and cambridge and is a man of parts should remain so utterly ignorant of his own social value as to fall gratefully into the trap of a loveless engagement planned by the first designing mother he meets in fact the whole story of the marriage with its outspoken sequel is unconvincing and when the hero is left in his misery we feel that the indictment against society would have been more forcible if it had been expressed with greater moderation and reserve,war_contra

to transfer to the stage of the world the drama which is being played in their own souls hence as mr d merejkowski believes in paganochristian dualism according to which the really full man the

great historical characters the instruments for expounding his own views on the subject in the second of the present trilogy of novels he modestly speaks through the lips of leonardo da vinci and

old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends current in southern india collected from oral tradition by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere the illustrations by c f frere murray many of those of our countrymen who have spent years in india will be surprised to find that our edd friends the fairies and goblins are as well known in hindu nurseries as in our own it is true that the names are different in the far east from those we give them but their doings are much the same and if we are to be devoured or frightened to death it matters very little whether the horrid monster who is to slay us is called a goblin or a ghid as in persia or a eakshas which is the term in these pages for such fiendish apparitions it must be owned however that if there be any difference in morale between the indian supernatural beings and those duly recognised here it is not in favour of the former the riikbhas seems upon the whole a more hope less and unmitigated fiend than his western brethren to the notorious bad qualities of blunderbore and other gigantic cannibals he adds an excessive filthiness which sinks him to the lowest depths in our estimation not content with chawing up ali the live children princes and princesses that he can meet with he is moreover addicted to tearing the decaying flesh off the bodies of criminals pending from the gallowstree and swallowing it wholesale he is further exceedingly dirty in his person and hence his fingernails are so poisonous that a human being falls down lifeless if scratched by one of them female rakshases present themselves as ugly old women with long claws instead of hands and with natural chignons of dreadfully tangled hair which must on no account ever be combed for excellent reasons to be found in these pages dirtier than the ogre the rakshas is less accommodating than the goblin and would on no account thresh out the corn or in any other way oblige the farmer or any one else like the lubber fiends of the west after these remarks the reader will not expect the rakshas to be a funny character he is simply frightful and disgusting though he sometimes makes a fool of himself by mistaking for instance a donkeys head and an enormous earthenware pot for an apparition of one of his own kin and similar blunders but the rakshas though literally a horrid fool is never amusing the fun of the indian fairy tale is done by the jackal the puck of the hindus one of the best stories in this volume is the jackal the barber and the brahmin in which the jackal plays all sorts of mischievous tricks upon the barber and befriends the brahmin after a comical fashion he induces the barber to join with him in buying a garden and eats up the fruit himself while he makes the barber believe it is not ripe he then marries the brahmins daughter for it turns out that he is in fact a prince who is a great magician and puts on a jackals skin and changes himself into a jackal for a frisk returning to his own shape when he pleases he gives the brahmin a melon which produces fruit full of jewels but the silly brahmin sells them all without looking inside and at last gets taken up on suspicion of theft the jackal then gives him a dish which produces inexhaustible supplies of food but the brahmin cannot keep his own counsel and the magical dish is taken by the rajah foralast present the jackal gives the brahmin a vessel out of which jump a rope and a stick which bind and beat the rajah and the purchaser of the gems until they return to the brahmin what they had taken from him the peris or fairies of these legends are much like other fairies they sleep in pomegranates fly where they please and fall in love with handsome youths ad libitum as a specimen of the tales we will give an extract from the story of surya bai or  the sun lady who is the daughter of a milkwoman and was carried off by eagles when an infant she grows up in the eagles nest which is a very comfortable bungalow indeed at the top of a tall tree the birds having gone a long journey to bring her a diamond ring she just escapes being eaten by a rakshas is rescued by a rajah whom she marries and is pushed into a well by his first wife she is then changed into a sunflower and next into a mango and recovers her human shape but has to grow up from infancy once again   now it came to piss that once when surya bai was taking water from the well for the old milkwoman the rajah rode by and as he saw her walking along he cried  that is my wife and rode after her as fast as possible surya bai hearing a gnat clatter of horses hoofs was frightened and ran home as fast as possible and hid herself and when though rajah reached the place there was only the old milkwoman to be seen standing at the door of her hut then the rajah said to her  give her up old woman you have no right to keep her she is mine she is mine1 but the old woman inswtred are you mad i dont know what you mean the rajah replied do not attempt to deceive me i baw my wife go in at your door she must be in the house your wife screamed the old womanyour wife  you mean my daughter who lately returned from the well do you think i am going to give my chihi up at your command  you are rajah iu your palace hut i am rajah in my own house and i wont give up my little daughter for any bidding of yours be otl with you or i ll pull out your beard ami so saying she seized a long stick and attacked the rajah calling out loudly to her husband and sons w ho came running to her aid the rajah s eing mattrs were against him ami having outridden his attendants and not being quite certain iimrover whether he had seen surya bai or wle tier she might not haw been really the poor viilkwi aus daughter rde off and returned to iir plic however he determined to sift the matt r as a tirt step he went to s  surya 15a old tt  dant who wan ttill in prison from le he i rut enough to mike him believe she wan not  1 niivy innocent i f sun a rai deah but i v v to stip ct the tirst ranee of having caeid it ht therefore ordered the old woman to l  s t at lib itvwill keeping a watchful e aeon iv rand bade her prove her devotion to her long t meriees bv going tn though om milkwoman iv  nd hriigin him as much infonnatiii   psb about the fondly and more particularly about the girl he had si en returning from the well so the attendant went to the milkwomans hons and made friends with her and bought some mdk and afterwards she staved and talked to ber af r a lew days though milk woman ceased to be siii iii of her and became quite cordial surva kus attendant then told how she had been rb lit r uiees waitingwoman and how th rj tli had tb town her into prison on her mistress tbah in r turn tr which intelligence the old milkoman imputed to her how the wonderful nirtigohad tumbled ino lier can as she dept under though tr and bow it had iniraculouly changed in tb  course itn hour into a beautiful little lady   wonder why die should have chosen my poor hons  to live in instead of any one elbes said the old woman then surya rais attendant said  have you ever asked her her history  perhaps she voum not mind telling it to you now so the milkwoman called the girl and as soon as the old attendant xw her she knew it was none i other than surya rai and her heart jumped for j joy but sdio remained silent wondering much for she knew her mistress bad been drownd in the i tank the old mi ik woman turned to surya i5ai i and said  my child you have lived lng with us j and been a nod daughter to me but i have never  asked you ymir hitory because i thought it must j be a sad  iv but if you do not far to tell it to me now t hnvld like to hear it surya bai  answered  motlier you speak true my story is  sad i beliv my real mother was a poer milk j woman like you and that she took me with her one dy wb n i was ipiite a little baby as she was gong to dl milk in the bazaar rut being tired with the long wuk sh sat down to rest and placed me also on the ground when suddenly a great ka de flew down and carried me away rut all the father and mother i ever knew were the two great eaglesah my child my child cried though milkwoman i was that poor woman the eagks hew away with my eldest girl when she waa only a year old have i found you after these many years  and she ran and called all her children and her husband to tellthemthe wonderful news then was there great rejoicing among them all when they were a little calmer her mother said to surya bai  tell us dear laughter how your life has been spent since first we lost you and surya bai went on the old eagles took me away to their home aud there i lived happily many years they loved to bring mo all the beautiful things they could find and at last one day they both went to fetch me a diamond ring from though red sea but while they were gone the fire went out iu the nest so i went to an old womans hut and got her to give me some fire and next day i dont know how it was as i was opening the outer door of the cage a sharp thing that was sticking in it ran into my hand and i fell down senseless i dont know how long i lay there but wheu i carno to myself i found though eagles must have com back and thought me dead and gone away for the diamond ring was on ray little finger a great many people were watching over me and amongst them was a rajah who asked me to go home with him and be his wife and he brought mo to this place and i was his ranee but his other wife the first ranee hated me for she was jealous and desired to kill me and one day she accomplished her purpose by pushing me into the tank for i was young and foolish and disregarded the warnings of my faithful old attendant who begged me not to go near the place ah  if i had only listened to her word i might have been happy still at these words the old attendant who had been sitting in the background rahed forward and kissed surya kais feet crying ah my lady   my lady have 1 found you at last and without j staying to hear more she ran back t though palace to tell the rajah though glad news then surya bai i told her parents how she had not wholly died in  ihe tank but becanic tv sunflower nnd how the first ranee seeing how feud though rajah was of the i plant had caused it to he thrown away  and then j how she had risen from the ashes of the sunflower in the form of a mango tree and how when the tret blossomed all her spirit wt nt into the little j mango flower and she ended by saying and i when the flower became fruit i know not by what  irresistible impulse i was induced to throw myself j into your milk can mother it was my destiny  and rs soon as you took me into your house i j began to recover my human form j of course the rajah soon finds surya bai  and they live happily for the rest of their days i sir b frere tells us in though introduction i  it is probable that most of the stories were i brought from among the lingaets of southern j india the sect to which annadesouzu tells us i her family belonged before their conversion to i christianity this anna de souza was the i ayah who narrated the stories and from whose lips miss frere avrote them down but the book reminds us very much of the gul i bakawali a tale translated into urdu by nihill chand from the persian of shaikh izz ttulhih there is the same  exuberance of imagination the same mixture of the persian peris and dews with the gods and goddesses of the hindu system such as ganpati parvati and shiva the story at page 19b of this volume of  the brahmin the tiger and the six judges will be found nearly word for word nt page zl of the gul i bakawali apropos of this the word written  buceoulee at page 130 of this book is no doubt bahoxtli though story of singh rajah at page 172 occurs in the hitopadcsa as the ninth fable of the book headed separation of friends this only shows how widely and how long the old hindu stories have circulated we cannot conclude without noticing a curious circumstance mentioned in the introduction it seems that ghosts are received with presented arms in india though they are only challenged here  in the more advanced and populous parts of the country though rakshas seems giving way to the  bhoot which more nearly resembles the mero ghost of modern european superstition but even in this diluted form such beings have an influence over indian imaginations to which it is difficult in these days to find any parallel in europe i found quite lately a traditionary order in existence at government house dapoorie near poona which directed the native sentry on guard  to present arms if a cat or dog jackal or goat entered or left the house or crossed near his beat during certain hours of the night because it was the ghostof a former governor who was still remembered as one of the best and kindest of men more practical matter will be found at page xxiii of the introduction where there are some important remarks on the rise of prices in india in those days houserent did not cost more than half a rupee a month and you could build a very comfortable house for a hundred rupees not such good houses as people now live in but well enough for people like us then a whole family could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month as they can now on thirty grain now a rupee a pound was then two annas a pound common sugar then one anna a pound is now worth four annas a pound oil which then sold for six pico a bottle now costs four annas four annaa worth of salt chillies tamarinds onions and garlic would then last a whole family a month  now the same monty would not buy a weeks supply such dungeree as you now pay half a rupee a yard for you could then buy from twenty to forty yards of for the rupee you could not get such good calico then as now but the dungeree did very well beef then was a pice a pound and the vegetables cost a pie a day for half a rupee you could fill the house with wood water also was much cheaper you etdd then get a man to bring you two large skins full morning and evening for a pie now he could not do it under haifa rupee or more if though children came crying for fruit a pie would get them as many guavas as they liked in the bazaar now youd have to pay that for each guava this shows how much more money people need now than they did then in these days when there is a talk of forming a society for though translation of old popular stories miss frere will be admitted to have performed a useful task in recording these curious stories of the hindus the illustrations by c f frere are worthy of all praise and on the whole we cordially recommend the volume of snakeworshipa tempting subject concerning which these pages afford many opportunities to discoursewe shall say nothing at present in expectation of mr fergussous forthcoming work  old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere murray a few ancient legends told by an old hindoo woman to her grandchildren and repeated to miss mary frere who has reduced them to readable english are here given the public the family of anna liberata de souza the  narrator were of the lingaet caste and settling near goa when the english held pcesession of that place were soon after converted to christianity the father and grandfather of anna were both in british employ and she became an ayah although the deccan is included in the title of this book it doe not appear that theta stories originated in that district at burr bartle pren tells na in tha introduction that probably moat of them wan brought from among tha lingaete one of the most stronriy marked divisions of the hindoo neat south of the river kistna collections of stories of this kind an especially valuable at throwing a light on the popular nonbnhmmioal superstitions of the lower classes of india in tha neighlxmrhood of poona where brahminism appears to be to prevalent it it found that vithoba the deified sage kundoba the deified shepherd and byroba the terrible one of the remnants of fetish or snakeworship divide the adoration of the lower castes with the regular hindoo deities but the true history of these local divinities is only to be obtained from popular tradition and it thus becomes important to preserve these evanescent remains of the superstition of a former age en they disappear before the progress of civilisation the most prominent superhuman personage of the legends now before us is the  rakshas a demoniacal ogre of enormous sue and possessing terrible teeth like the ghouls of the  arabian nights his greatest pleasure is feasting on dead bodies  other characteristics will remind the reader of the giants of norse and teutonic descent at present the  rakshas is giving way to the bhoot more nearly allied to our modern european ghost but yet possessing an enormous influence over the native imagination in the hilly and desert districts of sind the belief in supernatural beings is generally prevalent but there the rakshas is transformed to the gin  of the arabian nights the gin ofthe mountainous parts of beloochistan is a  dwarfish human being with large eyes and covered with long hair and is apt to breathe with a heavy snoring kind of noise the cobra or deadly hooded snake also frequently occurs as a supernatural being one of the indications left us of the serpentworship once so prevalent in western india it will surprise many to learn that this worship still exists to some extent among the lower classes and that the cobra is supposed to possess supernatural powers the native does not willingly kill him but endeavours by kind treatment to propitiate him and obtain good fortune for the house to which he belongs there is a curious similarity between the incidents in many of these fables and modern european ones especially those of german origin and here also as in all fairy tales there are certain wellmarked features beautiful princes and princesses continually occur and perform the most wonderful exploits the stepmother is always wicked the youngest daughter good and beautiful and the elder ones are depraved and repulsive the giants and ogres are as easily deceived as the cyclopes from whom sinbad escaped or as polyphemus whom the crafty ulysses blinded the jackal takes the place of his european cousin the fox and by his ingenuity and tact generally conquers every difficulty  and proves a bright moral example of the success of wit against brute j forcethe triumph of mind over matter we observe however in the story tit for tat of this collection that the ordinarily stupid camel not only drowns the jackal but has the best of the argument also in the legend of  pnnchkin the wicked magician we trace a great resemblance between him and the wizards of the arabian nights he possesses the same power of changing men and women into stones trees or animals  he can build up a palace by a wave of his wand and create a river or a mountain by his magic arts the romance of brave seventee bai in which a woman shows so much prudence judgment and valour is somewhat remarkable as the production of a country where the fair sex are held in general contempt miss mary frere puts forward the conjecture that some aggrieved old woman might have invented this narrative the following fable might be used to illustrate emersons celebrated essay on compensation liss inequality than ken deem a young rajah once said to his wuzeer  how is it that i am so often ill  i take great care of myself i never go out in the rain i wear wann clothes i eat good food yet i am always catching cold or getting fever in spite of all precautions overmuch care is worse than none at ail answered the wuzeer which i will soon prove to yon so he invited the rajah to accompany him for a walk in the fields before they had gone very far they met a poor shepherd the shepherd wae accustomed to be ont all day long tending his flock he had only a coarse cloak on which served bnt insufficiently to protect him from the rain and the coldfrom the dews by night and the san by day his food was parched corn his drink water and he lived out in the fields in a small hut made of plaited palm branches the wuzeer said to the rajah you know perfectly well what hard lives these poor shepherds lead accost this one and ask him if he often sniffers from the exposure which heis obliged to undergo the rajah did as the wusser told him and asked the shepherd whether he did not often suffer from rheumatism cold and fever the shepherd answered  perhaps it will surprise yon sire to hear that i never suffer from either the one or the other from childhood i have been accustomed to endure the extremes of hest and cold and i eunpoee that is why they never affect me at thie the rajah was very much astonished and he said to the wuxeer  1 own i am surprised bnt doubtless this shepherd is an extraordinarily etrong man whom nothing would ever affect we shall see enid the wusser and he invited the shepherd to the palace there for a long time the shepherd wss taken great care of he was never permitted to go out in the sun or rain he had good food and good clothes and he was not allowed to sit in a draught or get his feet wet at the end of some months the wuseer ssnt for him into a marble courtyard the floor of which he caused to be sprinkled with water the shepherd had been for some time so little need to exposure of say kino that wetting his feet caused him to take cold the place felt to him chilly and damp after thc palace he rapidly became worse aad in a short time in spite of all the doctors care he died  where ie our friend the shepherd   asked the besh a few days afterwards   he surely could not have caught com merely by treadiaf on the nwbu floor yon liad caused to be sprinklad with water  alastn answered the wnaeera the reault wm mow disastrous than i had anticipated the poor shepherd caught cold and is dead having been lately accustomed to overmuch care the sudden change of temperature killed him  yon see now to want dsssers we are exposed from which the poor are exempt it ie thus that nature equalises her best gifts wealth and opulence tend too frequently to destroy health and shorten life though they may give much enjoyment to it whilst it lasts the moral of these fables is generally good in one is celebrated the victory of truth over falsehood in another ingratitude is chastised  and in a third an undutiful child is destroyed by a serpent in  a funny story  we have the terrible punishment of a wicked woman who was ashamed of her mother and illtreated her  and a powerful and sagacious cobra who is the good genius of the virtuous and also in the end the nemesis of evildoers we cannot refrain from quoting no 10 which is a romance of the heavenly bodies and a lesson to all greedy and selfish people now nix sim thb hook um tux wrap went out to dinnek one day the san the moon and the wind went out to dine with their uncle and aunt the thunder and lightning their mother one of the most distant stars you see far up in th sky waited alone for her childrens return now both the sun and the wind were greedy and selfish they enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their motherbnt the gentle moon did not forget her of every dainty dish that was brought round she placed a small portion under one of her beautiful long fingernails that the star might also have a share in the treat on their return their mother who had kept watch for them all night long with her little bright eye said u well children what have you brought home for me then the sun who was eldest said  i have brought nothing home for you i went out to enjoy myself with my friendsnot to fetch a dinner for my mother and the wind said neither have i brought anything home for you mother yon could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for yon when i merely went out for my own pleasure bnt the moon said  mother fetch a j plate see what i have brought you and shaking her hands she showered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before then the star turned to the snn and spoke thus  because you went out to amuse yourself with your friends and feasted and enjoyed yourself without any thought of your mother at home you shall be cursed henceforth your rays shall be ever hot and scorching and shall burn all that they touch and men shall hate you and cover their heads when you appear and that is why the sun is so hot to this day then she turned to the wind and said  you also forgot your mother in the midst of yonr selfish pleasureshear your doom you shall always blow in the hot dry weather and shall parch and shrivel all living things and men shall detest and avoid you from this very time and that is why the wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable but to the moon she said daughter because you remembered your mother and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment from henceforth you shall be ever cool and calm and bright no noxious glare shall accompany yonr pure rays and men shall always call you  blessed and that is why the moons light is so soft and cool and beautiful even to this day  miss mary frere has executed her task with judgement and skill and has made a pleasing selection of original fables and ancient legends the style is simple but effective and very well suited to these tales of the countryside the introduction and notes by sir bartle frere are carefully written and contain much valuable information respecting the ancient traditions usages and mythology of the tribes of southern india the illustrations are prettily drawn by miss catherine frere and the coloured ones especially are

wndyridge by w riley 6s herbert jenkins  windyridge  is a new book by a new author from a new publisher and it hardly seems possible that any novel could be newer than that but it has a certain freshness of subject and treatment too to make its newness something more than a superficial gloss although the publishers note on the wrapper speaks of  mr  riley one suspects from internal evidence that the author is of the other sex  the men in the book are a womans men the gentle sentiment of the story and its whole outlook upon humanity are essentially feminine grace holden alone in the world wearies of the city hears  the call of the heather and answering it goes away into yorkshire lights on a delightfully quaint little village finds an ideal cottage to let in it takes the cottage for a year and settles down to carry on business there as a photographer the sketches of village life and character are very good and if the old farmers the kindly old squire the quaint motherly old soul who isgraces neighbour the pathetic man who is her first customer the finely honourable barrister whom grace dubs  the cynic and most of the other people of the tale are a more idyllic community than one generally encounters on this sinful earth they are admirably in keeping with the sweetness and quiet charm of the whole story for the story has an atmosphere and a curious charm of its own that are not easy to define there is a sort of dreammagic about it a delicate lavenderlike fragrance and the love romance that finds grace and stays with her at last wears the same sober pretty colours breathes the same subdued pleasant music the people in the novel the pathos and joy of their simple experiences the little bits of homely philosophythese are the things that make the book not only readable but enjoyable so that it lingers in your mind when you have done like the gracious memory of a midsummer nights dream of idyllic men and women you have never met and never hope to meet but would be glad to,war_contra
novel notes pietro ghisleri by f m crawford 3 vols macmilban why has mr crawford so strong a desire to draw scenes and characters of a highly polished complex and modern civilization when his success has been all in other directions in the presentation of the abnormal of the halfcivilized the romantic there was just enough in presentday rome to english eyes of the abnormal and the romantic to promise him a fair field for his powers but in his former roman books he had nearly exhausted it and in i pietro we have the continuation of a series from which the life has all gone out of the mere external movements of a complicated fashionable society mr crawford could always be the interpreter but of the play of mind and motive underneath never he has probably better qualities than the crispness of style the superficial lightness of touch that can exactly reproduce gossip and gaiety without losing any of its sparkle and its savour in this picture of roman society he reflects elegance but not enough entrain to keep a season going for a fortnight yet the situation he has chosen is evidently adapted for purposes of fiction there is something piquant about it we are introduced to a fashionable  set  of miscellaneous com position largely leavened by an old and exclusive aristocracy with a pride in its mediaeval castles and pedigrees in the background but showing on the surface the most modern the least romantic of aims a society that dances and dines a great deal and is bound together by amusement but with some mediaeval fierceness not eradicated piety at convenient seasons and in a measure consistent with good breeding is not unfashionable and superstition of the crudest kind is almost universal an element of provincialism is not wantingit never is in an exclusive societyand its chief evidence is the naif delight in which everybody in the set seems to take in gossip ranging from the mildly mischievous to the blackest slander this is the world that mr crawford bit by bit and lengthily describes present it he hardly does perhaps the fatal mistake was the introduction of the british characters a british elemelt does not always make for dulness but there are dull britons and he has chosen that some of them should represent the virtues in the roman world of fashion a wellbred rigid complacency in lower circles it would be called smugnessis the pervading quality of laura carlyon she was not amusing but we are asked to believe she inspired great passions in three persons two of whom she married roman ladies gave her the cold shoulder though she was the stepdaughter of prince gerano they used her very badly sent her to coventry believed her stepsister adeles malicious tales against her and that she had the evil eye they evidently thought her heaviness had something occult about it her own countrywomen would not have made the mistake the plot is literally a plotthat of the nervous jealous adble to ruin lauras happiness and reputation it is diabolical mediaeval in its cruelty and crime very modern and also very ridiculous in its formthe placing of virulent scarlet fever germs in the dinner napkins of guests for instance is part of itneedlessly tortuous in its execution the vengeance that overtakes the sinner is likewise very modem she falls a victim to morphia but the relation of her sufferings is more tedious than painfully impressive the title of the story suggests however that neither the heroine nor the criminal nor the plot is intended as the main feature of interest but ghisleri pietro is like most of mr crawfords heroes vaguely sympathetic he is a poor man of fashion with a romantic past and a dangerous reputation for we dont quite know what he is very popular and fascinating in society by reason of qualities which are not explained we are led to infer that his intellect and aspirations soar far above the world he lives in but there is only hearsay evidence of this still he discourages gossip and behaves honourably if he does make love in a dull way to the dull laura if there were any evident motive or ambition however weakly fulfilled lin the story we should be inclined not to insist so emphatically on its failure but there is nothing of the sort a clever satirical direction in vol iii how to gain ease in conversation how to win a reputation for joining cheerfully in the tulk of the day is one of the few bright spots the three volumes flow on and on with careless ease but at the back of the ease and behind the carelessness there is none of the concealed effort that commands success  new novels pietro ghisleri by f marion crawford 3 vols macmillan  co considering the immense amount that mr marion crawford writes it is wonderful that he manages to maintain so high a standard of excellence  pietro ghisleri is the latest addition to the series of novels devoted to the delineation of modern italian society and it may fairly be pronounced to fall little if at all short of any of its brilliant predecessors alike by parentage and by opportunity mr crawford is admirably equipped for his task he has italian blood in his veins he has lived long in italy and his descriptions of the cosmopolitan society of her principal towns are written from the inside wnat he brings home to his readers with remarkable force in his latest work is the thinness of the veneer with which modern civilization has glossed over the primitive instincts of the italian race you have only to scratch the roman noble of today to findin certain cases at any ratea borgia underneath mr crawford has told a story of a womans hatred and of the dire revenge which she plans and executes for the sake of a wholly imaginary wrong baldly outlined the plot is repulsive and almost incredible yet such is the authors skill in treating of the development of adele savellis fixed idea that no strain is imposed on the readers credulity this skill in handling a difficult motive is again displayed in the whole episode of laura ardens first marriage we are made to realise fully the attitude of the world in judging of apparently so illassorted a match while its true meaning to those primarily concerned is set forth with a tenderness and pathos which mr crawford has never surpassed as for the personage from whom the book takes its title he rivets interest from the outset and ends by commanding respect and admiration he is essentially a strong and human character and the gradual growth of his nobler self under the influence of a good womans friendship is most subtly and delicately portrayed the minor characters are all clearly and vigorously sketched and though the plot is of an extreme and somewhat longdrawn complexity there are no dull pages in this elaborate and engrossing study in contemporary manners and morals,war_contra

fiction shakespeares christmas and other stories by q a t quillercouch smith elder 6s of the seven stories in this volume not a single one perhaps could have been written by any one else but mr quillercouch everybody who likes qs work will enjoy them the only question is as to how much there is here which might lay claim to a place in a selection of the writers very best things and that is an interesting point when  q is on the table for when a tale or a salad is good enough to appeal alike to the eclectic and to those with more catholic palates one always wonders what the particular ingredient may be the absence of which would just spoil its peculiar zest for the few and yet make little or no difference to the many most people if asked why they like q will answer readily enough citing his masterful romanticism his sensibility to light and colour or the sap that runs so strongly through bis graceful springy tales of adventure by those signs they would readily pick out an unsigned tale as his even if the scene did not happen to be laid in the west country or the peninsula during the  backalong times when we fought boney but when mr quillercouch is at his happiest there is something else tooa kind of lyric salt as it were in the very air of his tales the res ult one thinks of all the lyrics he has ever read and loved which gives them a stimulating sting and tone in one of the best of these tales indeed the lamp and the guitar a lyric is actually introduced and used as a motif and a ringing raiting little song it is to prick you into alert apprehension with the very first line you can hear the guitars snapping and chiming to it from  my love she lives in salamanca down to  copy luisalove all spain  and when luisa herself sings it bravely with the rest it is not mr quillercouchs fault if you do not want to know what kind of pain the irony in it gives her the pathos of it all is that pretty luisa who flings her charm over a tittle band of patriots in the peninsular war loves not all spain but one alone of her countrymen who jealous magnanimous melancholy only finds out too late i that she had lived and would at any time have died for his sake yet manus macneill secret service agent who saw something of this romance and jotted it down in his memoirs does not dwell overmuch upon it though fuentes the spaniard was bis colleague and friend he had seen no doubt too many sad things in spain but the gusty glimpse that the reader gets of the story is perhaps all the finer for that turning from tragedy to comedy a certain  virtuous good song  ye sexes give ear i  lends title and theme to a capital breezy tale of a boatrace rowed and won against men by six strapping women ot saltash while lyric snatches abound again in the piece which gives its title to the book  shakespeares christmas  is not so much a story as a kind of daring brilliant invasion torch in hand of the intimate haunts of the elizabethan dramatists but torches however well they flare and however high you hold them are apt to throw disconcerting shadows especially if the night be foggy and in this succession of weird scenes the lights and shadows flicker somewhat bewilderingly over shakespeare and the burbages william herbert and nashe and young ben jonson as for john shakespeare that lusty roaring countryman who comes up from warwickshire for a london christmas he sees only  life  in the tremendous revels in the tavern on bankside it is left to the somewhat sorry london apprentice whom he carries with him to become a helpless spectator of the murder which follows hard upon the evenings amusement but mr quillercouch sees further than either and if the doubtful reader be in search of a clue he may perhaps find it in the quotation from bunyan which does duty as a foreword to the whole matter if this vivid excursus is neither quite history nor suite fiction it is at any rate the one thing in the book aat is sure to arrest the attention of all who open it it certainly fosters the hope that some day mr quillercouch may cover instead of continuing to experiment with a really big canvas,war_contra
rogue herries by hugh walpolc manain ior 6d on of the characters in mr aldous huseys point counter point makes an iluinating distinction between the kind of noelist he himself is mr huxleys own kind and what he calls very prettily the congenital novelist  who creates a world of people not with the aim whether monscious or unconscious of illustrating a viw of life but for its own sake he writs if you will for fun though it would probably be more accurate to say dot he writes of necessity in an endeavour to relieve the pressure on his imagination of dte fantasy that haunts him he may be unintellectual and even in a sense unintelligent he may be lamentably deficientas dickens the greatest of them wasin poetic sensibility intellectual curiosity and moral ideas or he may bethough this has nt happened yetas infinite in range as shakespeare himself these endowments re beside the point what distinguishes him from others for the purposes of our definition is that he is the vehicle perhaps eve the victim of an incessant copious creaon now mr hugh walpole is a congenital nvelist his stories his people his world hough they have necessarily a personal clouring from their author bear that unmistkable mark of authenticity the air of king not only spontaneous but selfcreated the story of rogue herries is probably the ricst as well as the longest of mr walpoles novels it has movement colour humour and drama it is robust and fullmooded and it has the true flavour of its pjriod which is the eighteenthcentury it tains many scenes that linger in the nmeory the chinese fair where herries dls  by auction his too importunate msress davids assertion of his manhood hn threatened for the last time as it provm with his fathers whip the duel beteen herries and osbaldistone the death of margaret herries who dies in the oldfashioned conversational manner wet movingly the witchbaiting and many ither and smaller things the most and best of these memorable episodes occur in the first of the books four parts mr walpole is perhaps at his best in a scene of bustling good cheer such as the christmas feast at  statesman peels  it was a scene of brilliant colour with the blazing fire the red berries of the holly glowing in every corner old johnny shoestring in bright blue breeches and with silver buckles to his shoes perched on a high stool fiddling for his life the brass gleaming faces shining the stamp of the shoon the screaming of the fiddle the clapclap of the hands as the turns were made in the danceand beyond the heat and the light the dark form of the valley lying in breathless stillness its face stroked by the fall of lingering reluctant snow mr walpole has indeed all the gifts of the born novelist he has also some of the faults that are commonly found in a too facile writer perhaps it is mere idiosyncrasy on my part that makes me impatient with his frequent lapses into short and scrappy paragraphs perhaps i am wrong in thinking that it is a storytellers business to coordinate his information before presenting it to the reader and that he should not rely too much on the bellmans maxim  what i tell you three times is true mr walpole can write when he chooses as well as the next man and often a great deal better his prose is sensitive as well as vigorous and his vision is acute as well as tolerant but above all his fertility in the creation of characters the prime business of your congenital novelist and the skill with which he sets them moving together must be the despair of many a more painstaking writer yet there is something lacking here is a long book romantic copiously eventful full of life but one rises from it without that sense of a profound and satisfying experience which great fiction induces it is as if the author had taken with both hands what comes to him so easily scattered it over his page and never troubled to demand of himself that last degree of concentration that makes all the differenc for this reason or for another it lu intimacy in davids flight with sa for example the dramatic tension of a admirable if conventional situation is destroyed by a kind of chattiness the autho breaking in to tell us that on this very spot in a later century a descendant of these two lovers would conduct quite another sort of wooing elsewhere he adopts too often the tiresome device of telling us that soandso was  always to remember  this or that these things serve only to destroy the illusion by reminding us that we are reading a st they release us from the persuasion that we are sharing an immediate present experience the life of herrics begins for us at thirty and ends half a century later he is shown as an implacable dreamer tormented by a vision of perfection that is symbolised for him in the fantasy of a white horse of incomparable beauty swim ming a lake and climbing a hillside to triumph disappointed in his quest for this ultimate harmony the mystic consummation of all desire he lives wilfully shut away in himself and those who know him only by his outward conduct judge him a rogue and worse suffering from a kind of frustrated nobility he is often cruel ad arrogant and always lonely he loves no one but his son david until in his middle forties he chances upon a young girl called mirabell in whom he at once recognises his hearts desire unfortunately i find it next to impossible to believe in this youg woman or in herries love for her for me she is a figment of pure romantic fancy an apparition the projection of a dream and the authors persuasion dta she is as good flesh and blood as the mg of his people casts a shadow of unrealiy over the latter part of a delightful ad heartwarming and yet exasperating boo i gelw bullm  mew ltovels rogue herries mr hugh walpoles new novel  rogue herries is set in the eighteenth century and is a remarkable study of a man francis herries is a rogue a waster a libertine and yet a gentleman such a man as has been dear to a hundred and one women novelists but no woman novelist could have drawn this man so convincingly so accurately with such masterly and artistic detachment with so clear an insight into his muddied and struggling spirituality i do not know whether it is mnr walpoles masterpiece perhaps i am not far enough from its first reading to judge properly as to that but i do not think it will ever rank among his lesser achievements it seems to me to be a major booknot only for mr walpole but for any writer it is more too than the stuii of a man it is the study of a family of a period of a whole district of england its setting the lake country is quite as important as its events and the coloured spaciousness of his descriptions has a value that is subtly dramatic perhaps more dramatic in essence than many of the apparently more dramatic moments in the plot mr walpole does not write like a poethe is too accomplished a technician to write sentences that might be mistaken for  poetic prose  vet there is something of a poetic sweep of a poetic creativeness about this long mellow and wholly coherent book from the first moment when we see herries in the inn at keswick we are conscious of the truth of his presentation as a psychological study the man is alive from his first entrance and mr walpole has a felicitous power of making his characters betray themselves in their insignificant actions as much as in their larger it is by our trivialities that we are known and the cumulative effect of a characters trivialities is the real triumph in his creation herriess wearing of his rich clothes to meet his pompous brother is a revelation all the more sure because it is not thrust at us but insinuated to us without undue comment at the moment and without analysis beyond its own open fact yet how significant it is of the rebel  the book as well as being a fulllength portrait of one man is a whole gallery of portraits some of them sketches of people in a particular moment others of people growing developing and reacting through a whole series of moments it is impossible in a reviews short space to give a proper idea of the variety of men and women who are painted in this book the whole herries family seems to be living before us when certain members of it are entirely in the background we are yet conscious that they are still living and going about their daily rounds somewhere outside the book covers and we wait for this or that member to reappear produce his or her reactions and show the family characteristics coming out with almost the sureness of fate perhaps the family was to the herries fate there are many studies of child life and these are as profound as they are exquisite the study of the son of e  rogue herries by hlugh walpole ios 6d macmillan mr iugh walpole osing for his bust to mr david evans rbs rogue herries david is as masterly as that of the father yet a little less interesting because he was himself a little less interesting but we are able to watch the father and the son diverging and yet never separating we can appreciate the antagonism in temper which never becomes an antagonism in appreciation both are men rarely has the almost feminine jealousy of a father been more finely described than in the chapter entitled  the seafather and son the emotion is so masculine there is sentiment but no sentimentality and at the back of it there is something so virily wilful both are menfor indeed it is at that moment that the young herries comes into his manhood the women are no less admirable the wife of herries so truly feminine in her lack of intuition rather than in her possession of it the daughter deborah subtle in her very subduedness and most of all mirabell starr there is a touch of goethes mignon in mirabell she has not the poetry of mignon but she has something of her peculiar apartness as if she were a being not perhaps of some other world but of some other manner of inner life it is not often that characterisations so primitively simple are so symbolical too i find looking back on the book that nearly all my impressions of it are either of the people in it or of the country in which it is set and i wonder whether that was mr walpoles intention scenes of drama and outside event in the book are neither few nor far between yet it is the people i remember first and the happenings afterwards but as i think again certain chapters do leap out with intensities of their own the death of the wife of herries the funeral of greataunt mariawith its extraordinary little study of the dog the pitiful drowning of mrs wilson the witch these undoubtedly are at the very height of modern fiction and i am far more tempted into byways of appreciation than along the high road of direct criticism if i may be allowed to remember that i am supposed to be  reviewing  this book i will venture one point of criticism though i feel ungrateful in doing so there is little humour but there is a wealth of quiet irony mr walpole does not repeat himself and this period novelthe fortyfive occurs in the middle of ithas a genuine freshness of inspiration at the same time its psychological wisdom is too penetrative and true for it to have the false freshness of romance it is a serious study of life a mature studv and a work of art wallace b nichols,war_contra
the shaving of shagpat the shaving of shagpat mr merediths first publication after his early volume of poems is not badly described in de gubernatis biographical dictionary as a  bernesque poem in prose the relation of this arabian entertainment to the  thousand nights and a night is just that of the poem of berin to the poem of boiardo there is a wonderfully clever and at times a wonderfully close echo of the original manner of narrative and of style  but at the same time an air of conscious extravagance a tone of half burlesque seriousness or half serious burlesque unlike most of mr merediths books  the shaving of shagpat became popular at once and it has remained more or less popular and very well known at least by name ever since and indeed it is seldom that a great writer has made his debut with a more brilliant or a more astonishing piece of work it is full full to  the shaving of shagpat and farina by george meredith a new edition chapman  hall 1887 overflowing of wit find humour poetry and romance imagination and thought it is delightfully impossible  it rushes on with a slackened bridle swiftly aud recklessly through  worlds not realised of fantastic adventure coherent in incoherence as dreams there is too the shadow of allegory that reconciles common sense to the impossible  farina glad as one is to meet with it again looks pale colourless and ineffective by the side of its infinitely more spirited companion it has at least one perfect ballad many charming passages and plenty of fancy and humour  it is important as marking a stage in mr merediths development  but it is all the same decidedly the least important of its authors works with this volume closes or seems to close the new edition whose course we have been reviewing during the past twelve months is it ungrateful to the publishers who have given us so much to hope that we may have yet one more volume at leasta volume containing  the tragic comedians and the novelettes of the new quarterly ungrateful we would not ungrateful we could not be messrs chapman and hall have conferred an unspeakable boon on the whole englishspeaking public they have at last put within the reach of every one a series of novels which in their way are unique in fiction  novels which add to the wealth of the wealthiest literature in the world novels which must soon or late place by the side of the names of fielding of thackeray and of dickens the name of george meredith  the shaving of shagpat an arabian enter tahune nt by george meredith chapman sc hall for power of imagination and for excellence of memory we know no one who can compare with that eastern lady who every morning in peril of losing her head contrived to draw from it at each coming daybreak for about two year3 and a haifa pretty story which effectually stopped execution the orientals say that silence is goldbut if the arabian lady had been as mute as leoma instead of being as loquacious as the queen of cambles who was devoured by her husband as the only way of silencing her she would certainly have fared worse and the world of light readers would have had some volumes the less in their libraries the success of the arabian nights called into being a multitude of imitators of oriental authors the stories in the collection so entitled are far from being suitable reading for young people and this has been seen by those editors who have made judicious selections for youthful readers of either sex of all the writers who have told stories or apologues in the eastern style thc least successful in this way perhaps was the author of  almoran and hamet the best was without doubt the chevalier de boufflers the author of  la heine de golconde the first story was in vast repute with our greatgrandsires  but we question if it either amused or instructed the young monarch for whose delight and edification it was said to have been written some criticgrimm if we remember rightly summarily criticised the story on its translation by the abbe prevost by remarking of the chief personages connected with this rhapsodythat almoran was a madmanhamet a simpleton their tutor a pedantand the author a fool the world perhaps will accept threefourths of the critical opinion so magisterially expressed  the queen of golconda like  almoran and hamet is oriental without having anything in common with the arabian nights it is as smart as  vathek and is pleasanter reading except that there is marked upon it the trail of that serpent which defaces so many french books otherwise of great merit this is the more curious as  aline reine de golconde was composed under very singular circumstances the chevalier de boufflers had withdrawn from the gay world where he had long sparkled the most brilliant of chevaliers he had exchanged the salons of paris for the seminaire de stesulpice in one of the cells of that celebrated establishment he had shut himself up in order to put himself into training to become a bishop he spent a few months in preparation for the responsible office in question consuming the whole of that period in the composition of thc sprightly story above named when he found that he had written a tale of which voltaire not foltairescott as eugene of the ambigu remarked the other day might have been the author he very properly con eluded that whatever his inclination may have been he had no true vocation for the episcopacy accordingly he reappeared in the world published his gaillarde volume clapped his sword on his thigh and set out with gaiety to fight the kings battles in germany a more direct imitation of the arabian nights and of the shuttingup of one story in another like the boxes in a conjuring trick is now before us in mr merediths  entertainment indeed it would be improper to call  almoran and  aline imitations of the stories listened to so eagerly by the eastern potentate mr meredith has avowedly imitated the style and manner of the oriental storytellers but his  shaving of shagpat he says  springs from no eastern source and is in every respect an original work let us add that it is a work which exhibits power of imagination ability in expression and skill in construction the task which the author set himself was not a light one it could have been no easy matter to fill near four hundred pages with incidents scenery personages customs and language all arabian without tripping this however mr meredith has effected he knows how to make his characters talk as well as look like arabians and it cannot be said of him as the german peasantboy said of himself when asked to repeat the pater noster that he knew the tune but could not remember the words the book however is not without faults shibli bagarag the barber and not shagpat the clothier is the hero of the latter we see but littleand this is the more to be regretted as the first portion of that little makes us hope that we shall have much more shagpat in his obesity and sleepiness reminds us of that king mentioned by one of the authors quoted in athenaeus who was so stupendously fat and so continually slumbering that when his friends visited him they took the long gold pin which hung from his girdle for that purpose and run it into his fat in order to wake him up into a little consciousness and conversational power shagpat with his head of hair is as magnificent as the venetian magnate spoken of by sismondi whose heard was so long that unless he carried it over his arm he was constantly treading upon it when walking why shagpat wished to preserve his hair may be read in the  entertainment how he looked may be seen below  he looked before him and lo one lolling in his shopfront and people standing outside the shop marking him with admiration and reverence and pointing him out to each other with approving gestures he who lolled there was indeed a miracle of hairiness black with hair as he had been muzzled with it and his head as it were a berry in a huge bush by reason of it then thought shibli bagarag tis shagpat if the mole could swear to him surely can i so he regarded the clothier and there was nought seen on earth like the gravity of shagpat as he lolled before those people that failed not to assemble in groups and gaze at him he was as a sleepy lion cased in his mane as an owl drowsy in the daylight of applause now would he close an eye or move two fingers but of other motion made he none yet the people gazed at him with eagerness shibli bagarag was astonished at them thinking hair hair there is might in hair but there is greater might in the barber nevertheless here the barber is scorned the grower of crops held in amazing reverence then thought he tis truly wondrous the crop he groweth not even king shamshureen after a thousand years sported such mighty profusion him i sheared it was a high task why not this shagpat the following shows how shahpesh the persian king punished khipil a dilatory architect who had promised to build a palace for the king within a certain period and failed to keep his word king and builder were walking together over the unfinished edifice  then he bade khipil lead him to the hall of state and when they were there shahpesh said  for a privilege and as a mark of my approbation i give thee permission to sit in the marble chair of yonder throne even in my presence o khipil khipil said  surely o king the chair is not yet executed and shahpesh exclaimed if this be so thou art but the length of thy measure on the ground o talkative onekhipil said  nay t is not so o king of splendours blind that i am  yonders indeed the chair and khipil feared the king and went to the place where the chair should be and bent his body in a sitting posture eying the king and made pretence to sit in the chair of shahpesh then said shahpesh as a token that i approve thy execution of the chair thou shalt be honoured by remaining seated in it one day and one night but move thou to the right or to the left showing thy soul insensible of the honour done thee transfixed thou shalt be with twenty arrows and five the king then left him with a guard of twentyfive of his bodyguard and they stood around him with bent bows so that khipil dared not move from his sitting posture and the masons and the people crowded to see khipil sitting on his masters chair tor it became rumoured about when they beheld him sitting upon nothing and he trembling to stir for fear of the loosening of the arrows they laughed so that they rolled upon the floor of the hall and the echoes of laughter

been written from any inner necessity and one feels that the immediate success of their forerunners may be responsible for this miss sylvia thompson recently stated in a daily newspaper that a novelist must be true to his age and implied that if the age is trivial he must write of trivialities or go unread miss thompsons mistake is in assuming that any age can be fundamentally trivial polyandrous american women with whitecarpeted diningrooms and footmen who wear yellow liveries in the morning literary philanderers who dine with their divorced wives and the clever cocktail drinkers who fill the pages of  winter comedy  are an insignificant fraction of the modern world or if they are not mliss thompson has failed to convey their significance her book of course has the usual merits of her work there are clear descriptions and clever rather edwardian conversations but these are not enough from an author who has shown herself capable of dealing with more worthy themes the two young australian collaborators whose first novel was hailed by mir arnold bennett as  a major phenomenon of modern fiction have again taken sydney in its early days as a background but the australian scene is only incidental and not essential to the story as in  a house is built an uppermiddleclass family is reduced to poverty and disgrace through the fathers suicide lucy the eldest daughter grimly resolves to maintain their pride and pave the way to the restoration of their fortunes by her two brothers  green memory is the story of her struggle and of the defeat which leads her to the realisation of higher values the book is pleasant and readable but it is to be hoped that these two authors will soon emerge from the nineteenth century and bring their delicate perceptions to bear at firsthand on the life of their owvn day martin mills  winter comedy by sylvia thompson heinernann 7s 6d stanton by desmond coke chapman  hall 7s 6d susan spray by sheila kayesmith casseu 7s 6d

i  it only answers  oh is it   and the reviewer who acts as a sort of reporter to these matches gets out of the difficulty by adding  well perhaps not life butdont you see literature to that there is no answer miss thompson seems to tackle modern life in winter comedy but in fact she only makes circles round it she is concerned of course with  modem problems discontent in the air a few bloodys slung about the triangle preliminary to the divorce court is it possible to be a nice quiet woman with all this jazz about  to have your fling and keep it too  to go native for a bit and be a good wife in the country and then crash off to paris with a lover  the answer to all these problems is simple yes you can do it with money all the characters in winter comdy have money when the book starts so that virtually miss thompson found the answer to her problems before she began writing one may be able to pity the poor little rich girl but not the poor little rich girl who pities herself miss thompson fusses too much over caroline she even makes her paint pictures art is so serious actually caroline is a sensationalist without the full determination to get her kick out of life she hovers between being in love with two men both determined and in earnest she loves the one who happens to be there in the end it is her husband who is there and all ends happily winter comedy is not a definitely bad book it is well written and the characters are individual though they have their stagefaces towards the reader but the whole atmosphere of the book is of a lot of people acting up to a newspaper article on  should wives leave home all very concerned and quiet and being damned decent about it miss thompson writes so well that one wishes she did not read newspapers stanton is also a novel with problems but in this case the problems are the most interesting part of the book mr desmond coke has written a number of novels about schoollife which are realistic and sympathetic and

  the clutch of circumstance or the   i  th i g  of darwn by dorothy senior  a  u black this mediaeval romance is virtually an adaptation of the tale of sir tristram as found in the eighth book of the morte darthur there are variations in the theme and it is brought to a happy conclusion in the lawful union of the lovers but many of the motives are repeated with little more than a change of names and in several instances the actual words of mailory are freely used inasmuch as the  morte darthur is by no means so familiar to the general reader as it ought to be we think it would have been becomingin the author to acknowledge her obligations to it for the rest the novel is agreeable enough in its way containing plenty of incident and sentiment set forth in the high courtly style that is considered appropriate in these cases miss senior moves upon her literary stilts with a good deal of elegance and her description of jousts and tourneys and such knightly doings is pleasantly pictorial,war_contra

the lane that had no turning by gilbert parker 6s heinemann these stories of life in lower canada are e little less dramatic perhaps a little less good as actual stories than some of their predecessors but the pleasant manner is here the savour of romance and of poetry pontiac folks are always charming as they are presented to us fresh from mr parkers brain and even when they appear with no particular story wrapped about them they are welcome if only for their grace the title story is the best not so much for the sake of the beautiful madelinette as of her patriotic proud poetic and impossible husband the seigneur of pontiac mr parker has been elsewhere more of an artist but we have in these tales a greater sense of reality we feel the observer more than the inventor and therefore it does not surprise us to hear the author saying this collection has been the most cherished of all my labours covering as it has done so many years and being the accepted of my anxious judgement out of a much larger gathering  the lane that had no turning short stories by gilbert parker heinemannthis is a collection of stories of frenchcanadian life when a successful novelist publishes a collection of stories written as these have been written during a number of years one cannot help suspecting that he is giving what is not quite his best it is however clear that in the present case mr parker should be under no such suspicion these stories are he says the accepted of my anxious judgement out of a much larger gathering and he expresses a not too modest hope that they are addressed to the public of the empire it is impossible to guess what the british empire may think of these tales but some humble individuals will assuredly find them too diffuse in narration and in incident too full of blood and poison one gladly almits that the setting is picturesque and indeed that every true study of life and character in lower canada is of peculiar interest to english readers  but one may be allowed to doubt whether this collection was worthy to be dedicated as it is to sir wilfrid laurier it is unfortunate that the stories do not succeed in conveying the impression they are intended to convey of the character of the frenchcanadians the least attractive and admirable traits are those that are most prominently brought forward to achieve what mr parker meant to achieve would require a more sympathetic imagination and a literary skill of a more delicate kind than he has succeeded in bringing to bis task the principal story is a well constructed piece of melodrama but one may hope that it is as unlike real life as a melodrama can be mr a t quillercouch has carried the art of writing short stories to a point at which they give considerable pleasure to the reader a volume containing fifteen of these narratives and dialogues has been lately published and is entitled old fires and profitable ghosts cassell  co they deal with ghosts and with events in cornwall and with 44 persons who either in spirit or in body revisit old scenes return upon themselves or old emotions or relate a message from a world beyond perception we quote this description from a prefatory note which also recounts the origin or explains the meaning of some of the fifteen stories one of the collection entitled once aboard the lugger eeems to have been written out at greater length and published as a volume under the name of 4ia the story is well handled in both forms and mr quillercouch expresses an opinion in favour of the shorter version as it appears in the volume now before us though he adds that others differ from him there is in fact little to choose between the two  old fires and profitable ghosts is a volume which deserves recognition and appreciation the house of the giants ward lock  co is the first and longest of fifteen stories of incident and excitement by yorick everett mr everett says that he has tried to see how fiction might work  when reduced to its lowest terms by rejecting superfluous detail and keeping only what is indispensable to the story that is just what a writer of short stories is naturally called upon to do there is nothing original in the device 4 the house of the giants falls between two stools it occupies more space than the other fourteen stories put together and is neither long nor short it tells of a german spy hunted by a russian agent on english soil and the rescue of hie interesting eister by a scots journalist a london artist and a yorkshireman it is a variant of an ofttold tale and the only excuse for using the flame materials and motives again would consist in resetting them with exceptional skill and eurrounding them with artistic or pathetic side interests which would be anything but superfluous details some of mr everetts shorter sketches are ingenious and satisfactory from messrs harper  brothers we have received a copy of palace tales by mr h fielding who is already known to the reading public as the author of a book dealing with events in upper burma entitled 4 thibaws queen which was reviewed in these columns some few years ago in the present instance mr fielding has reissued in england a collection of short stories which he tells his readers were current in court circles in days when burmese monarchs still filled burmese thrones and which he contributed in the first instance to the columns of the rangoon gazette if somewhat bordering on what greybearded critics might describe as frivolous these eight short tales are at any rate pleasantly written laughable and light nor does their collector and editor claim for them much more in the way of merit than this  but he points out and with great truth in his introduction that during the fifteen years which have elapsed since upper burma was incorporated with the possessions of the british empire much has changed and all is changing fast the palace still stands but is growing old and faded  and even more quickly than palace buildings decay the people who dwell around them are exchanging their old thoughts and habits for new ones mens memories are short in countries where books and histories are few and for the most part inaccessible so that praise is deserved by those who attempt to rescue from impending oblivion phases of life in the courts and chambers of an oriental king it would probably be wise however if those who dwell far away from asiatic courts and into whose hands this volume may fall exercised some caution in accepting it as in all details typical of the ways and modes of thought of kings princes ministers and courtiers the tales may be substantially correct that is they are tales which were told within the palace as they are retold in this book  the events described are so told in order to move mirth but the storyteller probably never intended his listeners to suppose that he was dealing with other than imaginary personages and imaginary situations thus if the king disguised and attended by a single courtier slips out of his palace after dark and prowls up and down the lanes around his capital all sorts of marvellous and thrilling incidents may be created  but that any burmese monarch ever could or did so expose himself to danger  in violation of all the venerated and binding laws of court etiquetteis open to considerable doubt the eighth and concluding story is perhaps the one most exposed to criticism the transmutation of the narrative from burmese into literary english may possibly be responsible for many wide departures from the language of the original but there seems also to be an air of improbability about numerous passages which can hardly thus be accounted for who can tell us how royalty in eastern palaces acts and speaks in its private chambers amid wives children and intimate associates when court ceremonials are ended  for ourselves wo pretend to possess no such knowledge  still we are far from satisfied that a chief minister would disturb his sovereigns leisure about a love affair in which one of the princes was concerned such minister knowing that somewhat later in the day he would see the king in the regular course of business it seems doubtful whether an experienced minister would risk the hostility of the kings brother by coming between him and the object of his affections would his majesty really eat mangoes with his chief queen would he not rather himself be eating the fruit while the chief queen on her knees humbly held the dish    what do you suppose be wants to see you for in such a hurry 7 asked the chief queen  cant fay auswered the king drying his augers on a silk napkin but very likely there is no money in the treasuryi daresay the cook cant get any money to buy us dinner can the foregoing represent the language and style of eastern king to eastern queen or is the phraseology only a version highly anglicised and revised of princely conversation  for our part also we suspect that if his majesty wished to see the gravediggers beautiful daughter who had fascinated his brother he would soon have sent an agentpresumably an experienced old womanto fetch her privately into the palace for inspection instead of going himself incognito to spy at her from behind a wall still the stories one and all of them are readable enough and provided that what they record of the sayings and doings inside and round about burmese court circles be not accepted as in all respects literally accurate they may be regarded as a not unwelcome addition to the books which concern themselves with burma and the burmese,war_contra

loosely together and more has to le taken for granted tlmu a more artistical management would have rendered necessary yet it is extraordinary how much the author has contrived to say within the compass of the few fanciful scenes into which his story falls a thoughtful reader will lat down the little hook to meditate on some of the most vital questions that affect humanity in its double

party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language,war_contra
i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen  co mr maxwells latest novel is virtually an elaborate and conscientious portrait of a temperament all the interest centres in one dominant personality the figure of a strong man with a titanic capacity and a passion for work john barnards ambition is an almost superhuman obsession he loves his work for its own sake as well as for the rewards it is to bring him he rejoices alike in his own power and in the contest but in the struggle for success his domestic happiness suffers shipwreck eventually his health breaks down in such a manner that the world of action is completely closed to him while the life of thought and introspection opens the latter portion of the book is an interesting study in morbid pathology skilfully and even impressively done the main flaw in this cleverly told story is the psychological development of lady edith the wife which just misses being convincing through imperfect realization we cannot believe in her departure from the path of virtue  i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen and co 6s every novelist is a psychologist nowadays the clash of mind with mind or the influence of mind upon mind forms the basis of ninetenths of our modern highly strung love stories not many writers however are as successful as is mr maxwell in delineating his characters in this latest novel from his pen we have perhaps as cleverly contrived a situation as he has ever given usthe antagonism between a man whose ideal is work work directed to one end and a woman whose ideal is love barnard who is rapidly rising in the financial world and means to rise to the top marries lady edith rathkeale in a severe attack of lovesickness she consenting sees in his tenderness the promise of a lifetimes happy comradeship he is never rough with her nor is he ever unkind or thoughtless but he simply does not understand her and is content in a placid unemotional way with the comforts of home which he samples between the rushes of business his wife gradually breaks down but by far the more serious collapse comes to barnard himself and a third of the book is taken up by the story of this failure of nerve and the effort to cure that strong overstrained brain we must say that here the interest flags considerably in spite of the long and wellwritten conversations the end is in view all the time and the reader grows restless on the whole however the situation is splendidly handled and the gradual drifting apart of husband and wife is portrayed very finely to make both of them seek consolation elsewhere was we think inartistic and a concession to the methods of the feujileton which the author should have resisted the redhaired typist and secretary with whom barnard has an  affair  is far too melodramatic to be convincing and the scene between her and lady edith carries little conviction barnard is capital with his colossal conceit of himself leave j b to his unfettered discretion  i john barnard he reminds us of the great joe bagstock the ending is sad but true to life and in the general scheme of his story mr maxwell proves himself a psychologist of no mean order,war_contra

fiction the mantle of elijah by i zangwill heinemann 6s whatever mr zangwill may be worth as an artist it is clear that he is more than a temperamenthe is a force he exercises a gift noticeable in commanding spirits and parodied in mediocritiesthe gift of range he has the large interest in life detached from himself which has been the inspiration of all great as distinguished from little masters in fiction his ego cheerily travels and is impressed by life it is venturesome and industrious therefore it does not starve for lack of subject matter or feed upon itself there is a kind of genius in being a jew but mr zangwill discovered that the ghettos of the world were not enough for him if not the ghettos neither were the studios and so at last we find him penetrating political laboratories elijah is a prophet who preaches peace and economy in days which the younger generation vaguely imagine to have been extinguished under crinolines in the oliveseason elijah became a cabinet minister and nursed an elisha whose precocious taste in mantles awoke his patrons hopes of an appreciative heir to his own but england emerged both from the crinoline and the glasshouse of 1851 and learned to maffic as well as traffic then elijahs mantle went begging for elisha became an imperialist the tragiirony of the book is both general and personal the man who wished to see  the wen of india amputated  and  the spider spinning his web across the cannons mouth  lived to see his own daughterthe sensitive and idealistic allegrasuffer as the wife of a person who when head of a great department of the state fomented a war which beaconsfield himself might have disdained to excuse and this person was elishaa very respectable though incongruous elisha be it added car en apparence toujours il na rien sacrifie rien repudie ni son norn ni ses theories ni  sa surface de radical as m berard says of another english politician broser is elishas workaday name ana it is one that cleverly indicates the formidable tenacity the expansive selfcomplacence and innate coarseness of fibre which characterise him he is to england what the lyons of unleavened bread is to the united states by cunningly describing himself in his election address as  a humble follower of marshmont the elijah of mr zangwills story he involved the latter in  opinions more iconoclastic than he had ever professed yet it was marshmonts  translation  to the upper house which induced broser to propose to his daughter and his humility did not prevent him from remarking to the first mrs broser when she pleaded her inability to converse with political gentlemen  well talk about me that will always interest them but his second helpmeet knew the texture of his humility and when on the occasion of going to a musichall he observed i couldnt risk hanging about ive wired for a box a  suspicion that what he could not risk was being incognito awoke within her a feeling of absolute pity for his limitations on its political side the book is distinctly successful herein mafekingliness so to call itthough mr zangwill has nought to do with south africais viewed philosophically kingdoms progress en mass in legislation and in almanacs but the quality of the type varies hardly at all through the centuries otherwise we would all be beyondmen underneath  rule britannia  breaks the cry  feefofum a primitive cry for blood or treasure the clever journalist and political opportunist are shadowy artists in insincerity euphemism is so habitual with them that to break to them the painful news that black is not white after all is to incur a serious responsibility these are not mr zangwills words but they outline the train of thought which he suggests on the domestic side his novel leaves something to be desired an immaculate lady of the old school found fault with him in our hearing for the pertness of his early victorian children but it must be observed that mr zangwill does not attempt to reproduce the typical early victorian domestic life he makes however a gallant effort to create the aristocracy in their own homes his duchess drops her final s as the privileged may hear the duke of fife do on the platform at this day when allegra remarks that something is an  economic fallacy she exclaims good graciouswhat is the world comin to such a phrase in your mouthits like a cigar did they drop their rs in those days  it hardly matters what does matter is the importation of a type whose presence in a mundane narrative is as perplexing as that of melmoth the wanderer we refer to the philosophical raphael dominick in whose company the probabilities suffer severely it is a character such as a poetromanticist could invest with charm knowing him to be patently of the stuff of dreams he would have filled him with the mellifluously mysterious speech of dreams and he would have been lifeless but beautiful but the lips of this bodiless zangwill open but to emit a crashing discord of clevernesses in chapter xxl book il he avenges bis creation by making even broser momentarily impossible we also object to the manner in which the characters run against one another for the convenience of the plot this is certainly victorianboth early and late the feminine triumph of the book in our opinion is elijahs wife in youth like how many heroines of fiction  she had clasped a hunted hare to her bosom an action that had made elijah fall in love with her but the cherisher of hares was a nagger of the most impracticable kind  you sent him to the shambles she screams to her innocent husband when she heard that their headstrong son had been killed in the war but when elijah is being mobbed for little englandism she rediscovers the hare in him and cries  fight fair you hounds of hell it is probable that this woman will appear overdrawn to many but we can vouch for the fact that she is an ablystudied cymric type allegra the heroine is drawn more ambitiously she writes a letter to her middleage as mrs meynell did to her old age but she uttered no words comparable with these oh in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee suddenly though time darkness silence hide thee this wind from thy lost country flits beside thee yet allegras letter which recurs as a motif in the book rings pathetically true the idealist she thought to marry turned out to be selfinterest under another name the idealist she did not marry was become a mere egoist and for refuge she had nothing better than a motherly representative of the feudalism she had once despised but we must pause mr zangwills book is as a whole worthy of his reputation lt is wise and witty serious and pathetic if it be not all life it is at least life and mr zangwill and the second of these twain is not bad company even when out of place  the mantle of elijah new novels by i zangwill heinemann that the mantle of elijah is worth reading and that it takes a little more than ordinary reading are selfevident facts matter and style combine to warn off the skipping or casual reader without exactly sympathising with mr zangwills points of view you are interested because he presents them and their interpreters in an arresting fashion there is sincerity in some of the intellectual and moral attitudes of his figures his style has matured a great deal since the days some fifteen years ago when  the premier and the painter was published but even then he showed himself to be as now of a different stamp from the facile and obvious novelists of the hour his new book contains cleverness of a very varied kind traits of fine imagination of high spiritual feeling keen observation of the actual and a singular sense of discrimination in character and dialogue jostle each other he has at command a fund of epigrammatic utterances but unlike the general run of such sayings they are not mere interpolations put in for their own sake they spring from the substance and sentiment of his work and may not be easily dissociated from them the principal interest is political it is also retrospective it is the period when crinolines berlin wool and bad ormolu were in vogue mr zangwill enjoys himself over a description of the decoration of a certain clock where art concealed the article so do we in this tale of a bygone timeand here is part of the clevernessmuch in our present political position is not only suggested but even implicitly judged the antiwar note the  lay down your arms is made to echo with no uncertain sound but there is full as much of private human nature as of politics and the domestic horizon and the motives and working of housohold minds are never swamped in the deluge of public affairs at home or abroad twenty years is a long run for the action of a story especially in these days the mantle of elijah almost demands as much for the development of the intellectual and moral forces of the leading characters they require full play and they get it now and then one feels that they almost get too much of it that the analysis and presentation are almost too close too serried the treatment of the engelborne group in the last part is not altogether happy these people are rather copiously than powerfully drawn yet their influence on allegra the heroine is a reason for their being at the age of sixteen allegra is a convinced but not unattractive idealist this is the most entertaining and interesting part of her career when we meet her again in book il she is a married and disenchanted woman of forty or thereabouts her illassorted marriage with broser a radical politician and her fathers secretary never appears wholly credible he is a strongly marked individual one of the best portraits or pictures in this gallery the mantle of the radical statesman an aristocrat by birth drops at length on the brawny shoulders of broser his follower only too ready to catch it he is the most robust and selfseeking of all the sons of the people yet depicted in fiction one feels the jarring aggressiveness of the man and the coarse germs of good and evil in his temperament he is strangely real the contrast between him and his amiable

the interior by lindsay russell 6s ward lock there are three women with whom readers fond of novels in a colonial setting are familiar there is the haughty fickle jade who has her being in the whirl and wickedness of london society the dusky beauty with the total lack of morals and the hibiscus flowers in her hair and the purehearted suntanned colonial girl we renew our acquaintance with these types in  the interior a novel in which most of the incident happens on an island off the coast of australia where the inhabitants live or fail to do so by pearl fishing a mercenary english girl sends the fiance who trusts her implicitly to australia in search of a fortune while she with all possible speed breaks her promises to him and marries a somewhat beefy millionaire with a fortune nearer at hand naturally this is a nasty blow for the hero but the colonial girl comes along and is beginning to console him quite nicely when owing to a series of misadventures he falls into the power of the dusky siren whom he marries the dusky beautyas dusky beauties often doprovidentially drinks herself to death and while the hero himself hovers between living and dying the millionaire quits this world his widow the mercenary english girl of earlier chapters whom he has carefully arranged shall not inherit his money remembers her old lover and comes out to see how the fortune hunting is progressing oving to the thoughtful way in which the lives between the hero and the succession to an earldom have been swept away and not thanks to the pearlfishing the fortune business is going nicely and for awhile one fears that the little colonial will be badly left yet at the end she gets what she wants which by the way is rather a habit of colonial young women of fiction the story moves briskly all the while and is eminently worth reading by reason of the atmosphere the author creates miss russell undoubtedly has the gift of writing poetic description which will linger in the heart of the reader long after the story has faded from the memory for this we must be grateful to her she has brought us close to a part of australia little known to stayathome britishers,war_contra
the unjust steward or the ministers debt by mrs oliphant chambers we must confess to a sneaking fondness for many of mrs oliphants stories she began to write before the days when fiction became an art and no doubt her conceptions of the possibilities and obligations of her calling are in comparison with modern lights limited her grammar and the construction of her sentences are by no means always beyond reproach yet for all this she has a wellbred leisurely style of her own which does not suffer by contrast with the fireworks and the vulgarities of certain younger and more ambitious ladies from time to time too she will give us a picture generally of some shrewd notable old scotch body which lingers pleasantly in the memory her latest production however is distinctly disappointing the situation suggested lacks coherency and plausibility it will not so to speak work out but is full of weak places which remind us of nothing so much as of dropped stitches in an old ladys knitting the idea of the story is this the rev claud buchanan a minister at st rule borrows 300 from an old friend mr anderson for his childrens outfit in life no paper passes but in the event of mr andersons death the minister is bound to declare the loan to the executor mr anderson does die soon and unexpectedly forgiving by a clause in his will all debts due to him of less than 100 after meditating on the parable of the unjust steward the minister is tempted and gives the executor to understand that what he has borrowed was only 50 the rest of the book is occupied with a study of his remorse and of his fear of detection by his own wife and children and by the defrauded heirs ultimately ho confesses is laughed at by the executor for his pains and apparently has a clear conscience ever after we submit that the ending is a grotesque one no executor could possibly have refused the offered restitution and even if such a solution had been feasible we can hardly suppose that it would have appeased the sensitive scruples of the minister and his wife then again we are irritated by the strain put on our credulity when we are asked to believe that the dishonest transaction was kept secret for the space of four years from the ministers wife she knew the amount of the debt and we do not see how as the story goes she can have escaped hearing again and again the precise terms of mr andersons will these points make the whole story seem unreal but the most serious weakness of all is a psychological one wo are convinced that the rev claud buchanan would not as a matter of fact have behaved so if mrs oliphant wishes us to believe that he did she is bound to prove it that is she is bound to let us see how it came about to put before us the mental processes which led up to so extraordinary an act one so out of keeping with the mans whole character if she had tried to do this we think she would have found that the temptation was inadequate in any case she has not dono it and therefore we decline to believe her accusation just as we should decline to believe except upon evidence a similar accusation against any clergyman of irreproachable reputation among our own acquaintance the little lovestory of which mrs oliphant has thought it necessary to make an underplot is not particularly interesting  but johnny wemyss the fishermans son who is designed for the ministry but prefers to become a naturalist is well and sympathetically drawn,war_contra

the californians reviews by gertrude atherton lane it is always with a flash of surprise that on laying down a novel by mrs atherton we realise how good it has been she really has all the faults her philosophical and critical jargon is hopelessly out of place and her chorus of girls with their frocks and their eyes are quite as vulgar as she intends and she has never learned how to write style she says with unconscious irony  style alone will give you a place in letters worth having but style is a land unknown to mrs atherton it is not for want of trying she  wordpaints conscientiously and strenuously and she clangs on every critical nerve consider this once she rode to the foothills escorted by dick they were covered with yellow and purple lupins miniature jungles which harboured nothing more sanguinary than the gopher and the cottontail the tawny poppies had hills all to themselves a blaze of colour as fiery as the sun to which they lifted their curved drowsy lips the mariposa lilies grew by the creeks in the dark shade of meeting willows the goldgreen moss was like plush on tile trees from the hills the great valley looked like a dense forest out of which lifted the tower of an enchanted castle not another signal of man was to be seen nothing but the excrescence on the big weddingcake house of a bonanza king beyond the hills rose the slopes of the mountains with their mighty redwoods their dark untrodden aisles their vast primaeval silences how it jars the ugliness of that plush upon the trees the grotesque discord of that confectionery simile nor has mrs atherton any more notion of structure than of ornament in fiction she has that terrible habit of beginning at the beginning the substance of the californians for instance consists in the varying relations of one man with two girls friends he falls in and out of love with each of them in turn and there is a good deal of play of temperament upon temperament a good deal of emotional crisis in the process this is all well enough but to get to this you have to work through a hundred pages of local colour and if you please a biography from childhood of the two young ladies in question all because mrs atherton does not know how to set the puppets working without it it was just the same in patience sparhawk it was just the same in american wives and english husbands tolerable the first time the device becomes irritating by repetition and yet when all is said and done mrs athertons are good novels you  pish  and  pshaw  for a while and then you feel that she is getting a hold on you her people are vigorously conceived and what is more they are interesting and they grow develop under circumstances furthermore she has an undeniable power of creating strong situations here is an example helena has taken magdalenas lover from her and after a short engagement throws him over she comes to tell magdalena that she has found him to he a man with an impure past magdalena knew this the knowledge the womans desire to save had been an element in her love for him her nerves are overwrought to the point of trying to kill her friend helena paused abruptly and caught her breath she had felt magdalena extend her arm and stealthily open a drawer in the bureau beside her chair there was nothing remarkable in the fact for in that drawer magdalena kept her handkerchiefs nevertheless helena shook with the palsy of terror the cold sweat burst from her body in the intense darkness she could see nothing only a vague patch where the face of magdalena was the silence was so strained that surely a shriek must come tearing across it the shriek came from her own throat she leapt to her feet like a panther reached the door in a  bound fled down the hall and the stair her eyes glancing wildly over her shoulder and so out to her horse it is many years since that night but there are silent moments when that ride through the woods flashes down her memory and chills her skinthat mad flight from an unimaginable horror through the black woods on a terrified horse the shadow of her fear racing just behind with outstretched arms and clutching fingers helenas sudden flight left magdalena staring through the dark at the spanish dagger in her hand her arm was raised her wrist curved the dagger pointed toward the space which helena had filled a moment ago i intended to kill her she said aloud i intended to kill her thisand this is only one of two or three equally strong scenes in the californiansstrikes us as really dramatic with a writer of less true instinct it

agreeable but it is most cleverly worked out in 4a daughter of the vine and what is more important the interest of the story commences at once 4 tyre californians con tains more detail and is altogether a more elaborate piece of work among women who have written american novels mrs atherton probably holds a position hardly contested by any rival there are however a good many modern english women novelists with whose method and style hers might be compared she secures an advantage over these ladies in the novelty and picturesqueness of the life and scenery with which she deals she is always vivacious and clear she can be sentimental without being mawkish but she seems unable to add the touch of delicacy and tenderness with which a great writer heightens the effect of his most vigorous studies from human nature in concentration of effect 4 a daughter of the vine shows an advance on 4 the californians it is a pity that the authors determination to be trenchant at all costs has led her in the later book to a conclusion which is almost brutal excessive length both of narrative and dialogue goes far to limit the interest of a passing emperor by robert shortz routledge  sons it is a story of life first at the united states military college at west point and afterwards when the hero and his comrade have been expelled in mexicoduring the days of the archduke maximilian otherwise the emperor maximiliano both sections of the book show the same lack of proportion in dealing with matters of detail and the whole volume amounts to little more than a wild story of adventure unsuited to boys as literature solely because there is a want of delicacy nearly amounting to impropriety in various places fighting and military movements are described with the same care and interest that appear in the same writers story of the days of napoleon in italy entitled  the gift of bonaparte the author in question now and then uses phraseology which stamps his writing as

th red rorer  tab  ttlk rkl kovkk bv the ai thou of  tin spy  the pilot  thc prairie c e s vols limo london lm2s avk must admit that in the present production of mr cooper we have been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the importance of

that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest trader

yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy

luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt

the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris,war_contra

absolutely preferableso dim and gloomy that on suddenly reaching daylight nt the end the traveller finds a painful effort of thought and memory in explaining to himself what it all meansmakes the sombre excitement of the journey as complete as the most romantic don quixote could imagine or desire when we add that the hero is a young man of fabulous wealth of overpowering genius and with a dreadful worm always gnawing at his heart have we not said enoughwhat with plain english and what with figures of speechto allow the author to congratulate himself with at least the unequivocal assurance that he has devised an exceedingly sensational story  unfortunately however even the novelreading tastes of this age require something more than this to make it content to own a book as  a good novel the kind of plot which we have indicated is no doubt the order of the day and we do not grumble at those whose business it is to keep messrs mudies counters stocked for accommodating the character of this supply to that of the demand but as we have had occasion to remark more than once lately a good plot whether it be that of a strange story or of the brothers dromiois not all that is

to accept a very high office the world is not the world we live in it is a world specially invented and called into existence by the author of the man of mark for the express purpose of giving his

intricate maze gets wearisome after a time if its windings are its only merit and unless there are pretty hedges on each side of the path and pleasant restingplaces every now and then and the larger the maze and the longer the process of threading it the more tedious does the operation become and the more wearisome the bare stone walls in  the man of mark  there are so to speak neither hedges nor arbours its sole plea of interest is the perplexity of its labyrinth even the temple at   vv the end is barely worth getting to and if ones sensation on arriving there is not exactly that a great deal of fuss has been wasted over nothing it is at all events that the goal and the road to it are both of them very unsatisfactory society has such a plethora of novels to choose from nowadays that it has no inducement to encourage those of which the number seems every day increasingwhose only attraction is a wild romance which after all we all know cannot by any possibility be founded on fact we have spoken of two or three exceptions to the general dearth of descriptive power which pervades these volumes on these two or three exceptions we are going to rest a word of serious and friendly advice they are quite enough to prove that the author is capable of far better work than such unsatisfactory stuff as this a pen that can portray incidents with the vigour and truthfulness to human nature with which he follows the supposed murderer in his wild flight or a pen that can sketch so quietly so tenderly with so much genuine pathos good feeling and good taste a happy deathbed scene is we

  meg of the scarlet foot by w edwards tirebuck harpers this is a somewhat incoherent book and irritates by the extraordinary prickly staccato style which mr tirebuck who really can write lucidly when

government for all things run smoothly and in perfect order under a small and unobtrusive aerial board of control which leaves absolute privacy and security to the individual  transportation is civilization democracy is disease in such a world crowds and the people are the one source of evil and a sporadic outbreak of now obsolete and mediaeval democratic agitation in chicago arouses a storm of agoraphobia and brings about the events to be narrated mr kipling does not describe but makes the readers imagination vividly realize the wonders of aerial navigation the groundcircuits and the destructive soundvibrations and withering rays of light which are the defences and the artillery of the future he moves among these sensations as if they were the commonplaces of existence as if mankind had been used to them for generations his is a realism that swift might have envied some artists excel in giving an air of the marvellous and stupendous to things that really exist such is mr

mr kipling can do both he can make the ordinary ultraromantic he can let us feel at home in a world where everything is new strange and astounding to him romance is a plaything which he handles with the skill and ease of a tennis champion brandishing a racket though none of the other stories travels into the word of mechanical wonders several perhaps most would in cold analysis seem quite as

circumstance is not a whit less amazing than that of his  easy as abc it is in fact all as easy as abc to mr kipling and that is perhaps what chiefly enthrals the discriminating reader and seizes our admiration for it is the manner not the matter of these latest masterpieces which challenges attention mr kipling offers nothing conspicuously new various as the contents are we are well acquainted with their different kinds he set the direction in every instance years ago the only wonder is that he is able to proceed still farther in every one true there is nothing of the same kind of imagination as in they or the brushwood boy this set contains no story having the fundamental seriousness of several earlier ones that cling to memory but as a craftsman and something higher than a craftsman mr kipling has gone on developing though he is not a novelist his characterdrawing is substantial enough to last out the different events of many stories stalky and beetle reappear here and the former has obviously lived there are also some sikhs and goorkhas reminiscent of kim and other indian stories perhaps it is a result of the war that infractions of the sixth commandment are treated with such sangfroid and nonchalance in  friendly brook and  the edge of the evening each story is followed by a kind of epilogue in verse which sometimes explains a rather cryptic meaning or at least enforces its bearing as mr kipling conceives it the land  is an excellent history of the british peasant who was there when the romans came and still is in real possession for whoever pays the taxes old mus hobden owns the land but the average quality of the verse is low some pieces such as  the children in spite of a swinburnian measure and fluent doublerhyming are merely consecutive lengths of prose we should like to have quoted from that charming comedy of schoolboy humours and howlers  regulus to show what mr kipling can do in the way of platon c as well as other dialogue he is

the red badge of courage by stephen crane 2s 6 pioneer series heinemann the conscientious literal method of fiction much in vogue today which registers sensations and gestures from minute to minute and solemnly records the heros wiping his shoes or placing one foot before the other in walking upstairs has its ludicrous sides but mr crane an american writer new to us and whom we wish to hear from again has the genius to know how to apply it there could be no better method for describing the sensations of a raw youth newly enlisted on the eve and in the hour of active service in the field the youths mind is a battleground too his thoulghts his fears his doubts his words his very gestures are worth recording for they mark not an orderly progression but a genuine development of the untried civilian into the capable and daring soldier what militarycourage means exactly for the average man you will learn here the narrative is stamped with truth just so did the youth feel you believe just so did he act it need not upset your ideals of heroism but it will temper them with sense and reasonableness the book has pictures of war in it that are masterly and it is everywhere marked by the quiet power that war had proved the hero of it to possess there were dark fearful and inglorious memories but in the end he had acquitted himself well  he had been to touch the great death and found that after all it was but the great death he was a man,war
in the track of the troops by r m ballantyne james nisbett and co 1 volmr ballantyne has in his preface taken care to inform us that he undertook to  supervise the work  of his friend mr childers the hero and narrator of the story to point his moral and adorn his tale on the understanding that he mr ballantyne was allowed  to modify mr childers sentences    and reverse his objectionable judgments this he has been enabled to do he assures us through the assistance of the war correspondents of the whole kingdom who are noted for the impartiality of their views but to make assurance doubly sure he  eliminates the opinions of those impartial men having done so he proceeds to write an interesting narrative of the horrors of the turkorussian war plentifully interspersed with thrilling adventures but at the same time the moral is pointed in anything but an impartial spirit for mr ballantyne invariably after describing an atrocity indulges in an antiturkish and prorussian homily what mr jeffry childers may think of this  adorning of his tale we do not know  but when in page 336 where the surrender of osman pasha is described and the russian general skobeleff is said to have exclaimed that  osman had saved the honour of his country wte are treated to a  meditation  detracting from the gallantry of the defence of plevna and concluding with the remark  so that honour which the country never possessed is supposed to have been saved we are inclined to doubt the impartiality or adornment and to deprecate the want of taste displayed in giving vent to indecent exultation over a beaten yet brave foe for as the russian troops are throughout spoken of as  our troops we must consider the turks as the authors enemies a very readable and interesting book both for old and young is thus spoilt by the evident bias displayed in its pages,war

citoyenne jacqueline citoyenne jacqueline a wvomans lot in the great french revolution by sarah tytler 3 vols alexander strahan i t is said of wilkie that he never introduced any object animate or inanimate into his pictures till he had become thoroughly acquainted with the one or handled the other similar praise is evidently due to miss tytler 1 citoyenne jacqueline more than in anything else reveals the cunning of the workmans hand in never for a single instant deviating from the natural and in never imputing motives to one class for the purpose of raising or lowering the standard of another fair and impartial to all the characters stand out in marked individuality living and breathing creatures while the scenery is as delicately true to nature as if a gainsborough or a linnell had painted it it is a charming book minute in its details yet never tiring and so full as it were of slight masterly touches on the glaze of the picture that the reader is every now and then tempted to linger as he proceeds with the story to enjoy a second perusal of many of its pages lest some of these delicate touches should have escaped him as an illustration we quote the opening passage of the book the early summer of 1792 was ripening the wheatears and darkening the vine leaves about the hamlet of fayeauxjonquilles the season was too far advanced however for showing the appropriateness of its sweetsmelling name or for proving that it had contributed in its day to the four thousand crowns worth of jonquilles spent on the progress of the great monarch to chantilly which is pleasantly chronicled by that jonquille among french womenmadame de sevigne but say was lucky in more than its name of fayeamongthejonquilles it had plump wheaters instead of the shrivelled heads of rye which replaced at a later date the jonquilles that enamelled and perfumed the steps of the sublime louis its present proprietors had suffered less than some from the roadmaking the charge on salt and the general taxes of the french people which took somewhat from the scent of the jonquilles and the sublimity of the louis say was in the interior of france sixty miles from paris it was nothing to speak

by walnut trees wound and clomb to the tour de faye giving one the impression that the village rose on tiptoe to curtsy to the feudal lord and master in spite of the prohibition of titles of rank by a national assembly and the flight of great flocks of nobles the tour was a true antique not setting its claim on massiveness or splendour it had the hoary picturesque grace of a grey lichen set between the green of the earth and the blue or daffodil or peabloom of the sky the walls were very thick and pierced with narrow windows they looked as if they might have stood sieges from the normans and the english the league and the fronde and as if they might yet stand another siege from a new jacquerie as an historical novel  citoyenne jacqueline  will owe much of its success to its thorough dramatic style not in the sense of an acting play but of one written for the closet never straining after effect and every page adding fresh proof of the unusual power of the writer and of the careful pains and study she has bestowed upon her work differing in the details of its manipulation from that of the waverley series there is still the same key to its inspirationa thorough knowledge of the spirit of the time in which the action of the tale mioves rather than the reproduction of the dry bones of past events scott knew well this secret of his art and so made the historical novel his own and many as have been the attempts to follow in his footsteps as yet failure or at least but partial success has been the chief result stepping out of the beaten track of those who consider the historical novel rather as a chronicle of facts than as the exponent of thoughts miss tytler manages to centre the chief interest of the story around the changing fortunes of the owner of the old feudal tour de say and his familyvicissitudes of which the description would be both trite and commonplace but for the skilful way in which are laid bare the workings of the human heart out of the depths of which whatever the training gush forth under the pressure of adversity very much that tends to ennoble our nature the novelists privilege is freely made use of but so carefully is fiction interwoven with fact that it claims the full merit of the proverb southeast 10on e vero e ben trovato take this picture of an old french marquis of 1 792 monsieur de lussac existed principally in connexion with meals but there could not be a huger mistake than to suppose him in consequence a nobody on the contrary wherever he went he became the presiding genius of the kitchen where asking and receiving cart blanche he installed himself in the admiring confidence of the chief of the department he entered so completely heart and soul into businessthrew himself so disinterestedly and generously into the choicest most recherche achievements for the entertainment of the chateau or hotel in which he was guest that like his less endowed marquise he emerged from his field of enterprise in a collapsed condition sat with halfclosed eyes or slumbered outright till the moment of trial when the fillet a la du barry or the salade i la volaille rewarded his great qualifications and covered him with glory then the marquis was at his culminating pointthen he not only carved and sent round a dish as a finished artiste would dispense it but he rendered it historical aesthetical poetical religious does the dish please you madame  i am ravished to hear ita bagatelle quite simplethe kernel of the affair had its birth at a lent supper of the great cardinals but let us await the souffletalso a virginal dish with a still more splendid origin this soufflet aux dattes was brought from egypt by no meaner personages than saint louis and marguerite of provence a spectator above all a convive could easily discover that the withered brighteyed old nobleman had lived at a time when dainty eating and famine were two of the institutions of france and when supper was one of the things to live for he was not malicious or tyrannical rather like most unrivalled men of science he was goodnatured and affable that he was likewise perfectly careless of all outside his own range was an unlucky not a remarkable abuse of his powers monsieur de lussac would really have preferred the whole universe to profit by his cftelettes and crmes since that was impossible he believed sincerely that men might as pivy i well perish of inanition as swallow garlic soup with a taste of artichokes the plot of the novel is well sustained to the end it never flags but like the larde snowball which boys delight in rolling on tilll it becomes an absorbing interest to all it leaves 11 pon the readers mind a sensation of regret that the last page has been reached when he comes to the end of the third volume ii citoyenne jacqueline is not a puling love tale its power lies in the simple pathos of the incidents and in the struggles of jacqueline to regain her lost position in the opening chapters jacqueline a descendant of the ancienne uoblesse makes a mesalliawce by becoming the wife of michel sarte her fathers registrar or bailiff thii3 illassorted match not only precipitates her from her rank in society but brings with it much bitterness and heart suffering a mere child at the time she neither loves nor cares to understand her husband but marries him in a fit of despair or pique having been jilted by her cousin achille for a fascinating and wealthy widow michel sartes character bears a vague resemblance to that of john halifax he is brave noble hearted and generous and though a peasant by birth truly one of natures gentlemen the descriptions of life during the reign of terror evidently drawn from lamartines girondists and of the sad partings of the condemned at the foot of the guillotine are told with deep feeling and pathos few novels have afforded us so much pleasure in the perusal nor can we lay th e book aside without calling attention to the happy delineation of the subordinate characters of the tale in which miss tytler shows how carefully she has studied the rich raciness of french life in its most piquant phases  citoyenne jacqueline  must take its place beside the best novels of the

fiction wak and peace a novel by leo tolstoy a new and complete translation from the russian by constance garnett in three volumes heinemann 7s 6d each it is difficult to give adequate expression to the state of mind in which we are left after reading this extraordinary book two things however are tolerably clear  we feel a hatred of war and a general dislike of the russians after reading the  debacle or any of the marguerittes war novels we have an equally intense hatred of war but the heartiest sympathy for both the nations engaged in it it seems scarcely credible that tolstoy set out to paint his countrymen and countrywomen in the ugliest possible light and yet with one or two exceptions we never wish to hear of or to meet any of his characters again whatever tolstoy meant to do he paints russian nature or rather perhaps the slavonic temperament and not human nature as it is and has always been and thus the book can never rank as one of the great novels of the world we are constantly struck by the alternating moods the irresoluteness of the men their love of pleasure and of low vulgar amusements their desire for fame or rather notoriety their insulting attitude towards women  as by the frivolity the vanity the stupidity the irresponsibility of the wemen who are however quite good enough for the men whose mates they are and such persons were the political and social rulers of russia in the first quarter of the nineteenth century and some would have us believe that they are much the same today if so many of the things that seem to us so strange in russia are explained tolstoy began to write  war and peace  in 1862 just after his marriage it was published between 1864 and 1869 he had entered the army in 1851 and had personal experience of war in the crimea he belonged of course by birth to the aristocracy it is possible he describes his parents in the persons of rostov and his wife but as by the time he was nine tolstoy had lost both his father and mother he could only have had a faint recollection of them a long array of kings princes and nobles taking part in the napoleonic wars flits across our vision among whom two men stand out and win our sympathiesprince andre volkonsky and peter bezouchow and one womanthe princess marya volkonsky prince andre is lovable and comprehensible a delightful character drawn with exquisite art and skill his faults were human we follow his fortunes with the deepest interest we love honour respect him peter is probably tolstoy himself in the particular phase in which he happened to be in the sixties he has passed through many and various phases since a recent writer on tolstoy says  peter is the embodiment of all that is good and bad in the russian temperament on the one side there is the striving after an ideal and a capacity for selfsacrifice on the other an absence of firmness and balance like tolstoy himself he is always in doubt as to what is right and what is wrong as to the meaning of life and death and like him can find no answer to these riddles the princess marya is unselfish uncomplaining always able to see good where others are only too ready to see evil full of the milk of human kindness and of quick sympathy for the troubles of others yet no saint withal it is not for us to discuss here tolstoys claims as a thinker and philosopher but he can scarcely claim to be a novelist in the true sense of the word he lacks the sense of proportionhe gives either too much detail or too littlehe lacks too the gift of telling a tale compactly and artistically his long novels remind us of certain fresco paintings in the churches and palaces of italy which we never succeed in grasping as a whole single figures sometimes even a group of figures now a bit of landscape in the background or perhaps some inanimate accessory stands out but the work as a whole remains confused and dim of the excellence of mrs garnetts translation no praise is too high she writes a vigorous nervous english that it is the purest pleasure to read the spelling of russian names always seems to present difficulty mrs garnett spells them quite differently from the writer we quoted above and sometimes she gives the french form of the namea proceeding which is surely out of place in an english translation if not russian would it not be best to employ english,war

jackals fierce in their number drove ber away and there she stood without the circle panting beautiful and battled with her white teeth and glossy skin and sparkling eyes of rabid rage suddenly as one

towards night he re turned home but the gates of the city were shut and he went down into thc valley of jehosaphat and entered the tomb of absalom  and slept and be dreamed a dream  and next morning he came into the city smiling and  the maiden met him and she said k is that  thou art thou a laugher and lie answered k behold yesterday being disconsolate i went out of the city into thc desert and

higher command by edlef koppen 7s 6d faber  faber herr edlef koppens  higher command is a good sample of the many warbooks which have followed the path of  au quiet on the western front there is nothing novel in his description of war or his characterisation of fighting men but he has given his book a certain distinction by including at many points in the story excerpts from actual wartime speeches documents and army orders they form an ironic commentary on the soldiers experiences and they are in fact the most interesting part of the book this touch of originality is just enough to make  higher command  worth while but the rest of his story only increases ones admiration for erich maria remarque whose work seems all the finer when contrasted with the clumsier efforts of his imitators,war

air miidshiipman easy by the author of peter s1mpli 3 vols post 8vo saunders  otley captain mairiyat is a deserved favourite of the public the many works which he has presented for the perusal of the novelreading woril have all been decided hits and have wvon for him the reputation of being our best seanovelist the good qualities of his books up to the appearance of the present volumes have been progressiveand consequently from the author of peter simple very much was expected  nor indeed whatever blemishes the candid reviewer must point out has the hope been dlisappointed the tale is neither so full of incident nor are the characters drawn with that forcenor indeed is the whole so well finished as peter simple  but waith the exception of our favourite we have great pleasure in stating our conscientious opinion that mr midshipman elasy is the best of the authors novels captain marvatt is not like mano of his tribe of litterateurs who write merely to amuse without a moral object each of his books has a distinct end in vice  and in each he has considered a novel as a channel through which wholesome advice may be conveyed in a palatable form and there is reason to believe that his writings have not only amused the public but have also lone no small good to the navy whether or not  out and out radical notions are gaining ground in the service we pretend not to know if the alolbinlations of radicalism are tainting the middies all well and good  the e quality mania must be written down but if not why the gallant author has raised up a mans ot straw in order to knock him down but to tell the truth we suspect him of aiming his shafts at civil as well as naval politics oh fie captain marryatthis is too bad  but to the story the hero jack leasv is the son of a wealthy country gentleman imbued with the revolutionary notions of equality which prevailed in england at the close of the last century which of course he is made bv the author to express in so absurd and unlimited a manner as to make the reader laugh at mr easys expense jack as tiresome and obstinate a little brat as ever sucked of a wet nurse imbibes from his father at a very early period all his peculiar notions of equality and it requires all the hard discipline detailed in these three volumes to knock them out of his noddle his first acquaintance with schooldiscipline would it is reasonably supposed have opened the youngsters eves but no not even his acquaintance with the watchdog the bull and the beehive while robbing an orchard to the fruit of which in arguing the point he claims an equal right with the owner nor his ducking in the fishpond when caught poaching on a neighbours property are sufficient to convince master jack of the untenableness of his position the theory of equality not being satisfactorily proved on land as far as his experience goes he determines to try its truth at sea and he accordingly asserts to his father his right on the principle of equality of determining his own profession the  point is argued and jack prevails by influence with a captain fortunately for jack under pecuniary obligations to mr eiasy he is appointed midshipman on board the harpy and in due time he makes his way to portsmouth after enjoying his notions of equality by spending his money like a lord for three weeks and after insulting the first lieutenant of his own ship one of the best scenes in the book he goes on board and while in the service meets with a variety of adventures particularly in the mediterranean on board in engagements and on shore all of which tend to prove the invalidity of his favourite point jack on the whole is a lucky fellow with his vltra notions to escape mastheading or the bilbos he gets married in the end to donna agnes a spanish lady whom he had once released from a prize ship and afterwards fallen in love with at palermo mr easy senior becomes starkmad with the equality mania and dies jack succeeds to eight thousand a vear leaves the navy and becomes a country gentleman and a conservative there are some admirably humorous scenes in these volumes which might be extracted if our space allowed and we did not wish to forestall the readers lleasure jacks learning his alphabet withhis nother and afterwards with the schoolmaster the first interview between him and the lieutenant biggs ad venture at gibraltar illustrative of  duty before decency and the duel scene at malta are perhaps the best but there are many others at which we have laughed incontinently the best drawn characters are mesty quite a bijou in his way although a black diamond easthupp the pursers steward ci devant pickpocket talbovs the mathematical gunner and gascoigne the firm friend and ally of easy the foreigners are we think rather a failure after pointing out so much that is excellent in mr midshipman easy we mnay safely take up the pen to make some strictures on the book we do not go the length of saying with one of our great men that he who would make a pun would pick a pocket but we detest puns except after dinner when a few glasses of wine have made us very amiable and easy to please written puns are absolutely intolerable need it be said that such wretched traps for horselaughers are quite unworthy of the acknowledged talents of captain marryat i but a much graver charge is that of representing the roman religion and its priesthood in an odious light such bigotry is now quite pase and can only serve to disgust the intelligent reader and injure the captains credit the most rabid orangemen could not paint more revolting scenes than are here given of the foul conduct of the romish priesthood the author may have his own opinions on these matters and we will not argue the point but we question the good taste of dragging them before the public in a work of fiction those of our readers who enjoy hearty merriment must read these volumes  mr midshipman easy literature notices of new works by the author of  peter simple  ja cob faithful c 3 vols this is a beautiful personification of a principle a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown as in a multiplicity of mirrors hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity had mr midshipman easy existed he must per force have acted precisely as captain marryat has made him act and that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service all who know that noble service will testify though the midshipmen kanya who have appeared on his majestys books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this mr midshipman easy par excellence occupies in captain marryats we have given in a long extract in our preceding number a specimen of what this exciting novel is it was the opening of the tale and with the sliest humour and in the blandest style covereel the most hiting satire of this almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit of which not one two but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force the paternal mr kasy having allowed his goodnature to run to seed which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania carried out even to the agrarian law anel a community of goods becomes as such a person infallibly must a madman abroad and a tyrant at home though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow the expression is pretty though a little used and something sharper than thorns elsewhere and everywhere else he still follows it out as all other democrats do until it interferes with his own convenience and at length notwithstanding the junior easys assertions to the contrary the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school this part of the story which is not at all maritime but strictly natural and highly amusing will be found philosophical also now the embryo mr midshipman easy inherits from his worthy father a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent this leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations out of which he always extricates himself with glory owing to the sound principle upon which he always acts of taking things easily should he be on the horns of a bull or of a dilemma no fear for master easy he will contrive to lip himself off softly from the one without a broken bone and to extricate himself honourably from the other by making an easy cushion between them from which to combat his adversary but as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united like the roman conquerors of old they resolve to divide the world between them old easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth vonni kasy all those who reside on the waters with a shamefully ample allowance the latter goes to sea as a midshipman then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence thc reader may suppose that at first in endeavouring to take all things easy he of that name finds it goes hard with him no such tliintr he is imperturbable command him he argues the case and produces his minorreprove him he argues the case still and produces his majorwell he is still unconquered  then to wind up the debate his superior officer proceeds to punish himbut he is not beaten  he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises and ultimately proves himself to be in the right by taking his punishment easily but the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall with all his whimsies do himself great honour and his country some service by mr easys maimer of thinking and acting he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel but his many droll and highly interesting adventures gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles by teaching him that in this ever shifting world everything will ultimately find its own level worth and activity rising vice profligacy and stupidity sinking to the depths of their natural degradation lu fact mr easy though always liberal becomes very gentlemanly and a good tory leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed  for mr easy senior not having been to sea to gain wisdom goes on from bad to worse from the whimsical to the extravagant and from the extravagant to thc insane all this part of the tale is a melancholy but a true picture of our fallible natures the love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of madame de staels aphorism that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man but captain marryat has contrived to make his midshipmans episode a very exquisite one the naval scenes as usual with this author are glorious the storm the fight the imminent danger are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master the delineation of the various characters that act with mr easy are also first rate what a troop of creations has this writer called forth we will not use the cant of criticism and say as that cant too frequently does this is the last and best of his works it is not better than  peter simple nor better written than  jacob faithful or a more true picture of life as life really is than  japhet in search of a father each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself which excellence could not by any possibility belong to the other midshipman easy is inferior to none of captain marryats preceding works  we think that the world will prefer it to any of them  but this preference ought not and will not throw his other productions into shade we shall conclude our remarks by saying that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country not merely originated one to be improved by othersand the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas over which we hope that england may be for ever

godl and the king by marjorie bowen methuen and i co 6s with  god and the king  miss marjorie bowen has now completed the third and last volume dealing with william of orange the passage of history chosen in the present instance is the time of williams sovereignty over the english people and probably because of the more prosaic nature of the period the story lacks something of the glamour of the stirring times in  i will maintain when the young prince was fighting and overcoming all obstacles in his endeavour to save his country williams love for and devotion to his wife are brought out very strongly in the book as is also his great grief at her death there is always a certain feeling of sadness in reading about the declining years of a mans life especially so when those years are lonely and spent amid surroundings which are in no way congenial as was the case with william iii for he was not a popular monarch miss bowen has expended a good deal of earnest thought upon the characters in her trilogy and together they show the result of painstaking and indefatigable labour  god and the king by marjorie bowen methuen  co this book completes miss bowens trilogy dealing with the life of william of orange  and it is worthy of note that the last volume sustains if it does not surpass the interest of the previous parts in this william is shown amid the intrigues which subsequently placed him on the throne of england and his life as king is also included in the sketch the canvas is full and vivid it is as we have had occasion to remark before almost as a piece of history and not as a novel that we read miss bowens work she has an eager admiration for her hero yet she paints him once again with all his defects if this be not the real stadtholder it is as flood a portrait as we are likely to get so too whether authentic or not the character of sunderland is graphically realized indeed the gallery of portraits is large and brilliant perhaps the best scenecer tainly the most ambitious in its subdued emotionalismis that which pictures the death of the queen and the collapse of the king miss bowen makes the reader feel throughout sympathy and admiration for william rather than affection and she is justified by history we congratulate her on a fine achievement,war
the brown brethren by patrick macgill herbert jenkins 6s net rifleman patrick macgill is a great realist as well as an artist and a poeta rare combination which has given him a unique place in the world of literature his prewar books were zolaesque in their accuracy of detail and intensity of purpose we have found his poems lyrical and beautiful and his warsongs and warbooks realistic and graphic glimpses of trenchlife as seen through the eyes of the common soldier the brown brethren is the third of the warbooks published since the young author took his part in the great contest with the irish rifles and it is a every way a worthy follower of the red horizon and the great push it is concerned chiefly with the adventures of thomas bubb nicknamed spudhole a typical cockney sergeant snogger who substituted  w  for  r  when speaking bowdy benners who drank french beer like a fish and fitzgerald a young irishman with a college education these men with others of their platoon who share all the horrors of trench warfare are always laughing and jesting with the characteristic philosophy of the british tommy but patrick macgill hides nothing of the grim horror of the battlefield he lets us see it with much the same vividness as henri barbusse in under fire and by so doing he renders the same service to english readers as the french poilu does for our allies such books as these should be of considerable value in influencing the future generations to cease war,war

the odyssey of homer books ixii translated into english verse by the earl of carnarvon macmillan  co so wide are the ways of homeric translation so manifold the riches of that large heroic world that each new translator is welcome and none the less if to our comfort he reminds us that in spite of mr matthew arnold even our  upper classes are not yet wholly  barbarized and that an earl may yet be faithful to the best tradition of his order and love things greek with the faith and taste of an elgin or a derby for this at least our thanks are due to lord carnarvon and we further owe him a full recognition of the purity and simplicity of his style which shows the power of greek literature to chasten and refine it is only a pity that this negative influence has been pushed too far while anxious to remember that for the greeks virtue lay in though mean he has almost forgotten that there is another mean in which lies mediocrity he has doubtless aimed at and certainly attained a uniform level of work but it is the level of the plain not of the mountain lands of homer it is small comfort that a translator seldom sinks if he never rises lord carnarvon has made a primary mistake in his metre and from beginning to end illustrates to the full the dangers of blank verse to a writer who has little ear so glaring is this deficiency in his case that he once or twice has overlooked lines a foot short book vi 217 ix 115 an irregularity which is but imperfectly compensated by a line of six feet xi 585 after this it seems almost hypercritical to complain that we find unconscious rhymes xi 1789 47980 5423 or that only by ingenuity and counting of syllables can such lines be scanned as viii 5213 then the wise chief cut from the chineof a whitetusked boar a goodly morsel the right

the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a printers error,war
the reds of the midi here is a historical novel such as we get only once in a very long time and in a translation so good as to balmost as much a rarity the author is a very distinguished provenalmy information i may as well confess is derived entirely from the prefacewho is at this moment capouliw that is official head of the fulibrige the society of provensal men of letters being second in succession to mistral he has written epics and lyrics and stories in prose and conspicuous among these wst is this tale of the march of the marseilles battalion to paris it is a very remarkable work it is literaturewhich not one such story in a thousand contrives to be but just because historical romance is fashionable now i should recommend it with a warning to those who read mr stanley weyman and his entertaining brothers and imitators in england it is not a budoir version of a rough chapter out of a rough and terrible time it is very real and very ungenteel the marseilles men did not fight in kid gloves nor save when they were shouting their songs or their stereotyped cries did they utter fine sentiments no one at all in this story is told gff to speak words of horror or deprecation or to adjust the balance so as to be quite fair all round it is made up of the recollections of a rude untaught peasant boy that marched with the battalion who had no theories but sang the marsellaise with greater faith than he had ever sung a litany no philosophy of any kind blurred what he actually saw his story is a peasants story and told to peasants there is a good deal to find fault with the incidents relating to the marquis dambrun and his family and surto and l jacarasse seem like a hallucination and that the wretches should stifler death by the very guillotine on which the child they had plotted to kill had innocently written her name is a straining after an artificial effect which is below the level of the rest but indeed the story does not much concern a reader though the characters do little pascalet margan and samat with his banner of the rights of man and his goodhumoured intolerance of anybody who would not applaud and look cheerful at their passage are not made of printers ink but of living flesh and blood and they make their presence felt it is the noisiest the most turbulent book plunge into it at almost any page and you know at once it is men of the midi you have to do with all that long weary trudge to paris with momentary intervals of depression their tongues and their throats are making a deafening din with the carmagnole or their own hymn the exuberance of their spirits produces every appearance of disorder they are chattering excitable children the vitality of a northerner would have given out long before in mere waste emotion but these had enough and to spare there was method in their madness they reached paris and tired of waiting for the word of attack from the finnicking timid townsfolk they gave the word themselves that

before the dawn by katherine james chapman and hall 6s the young authorand the mature one too for that matterwould do well to pay good heed to punctuation in the telling of a story and in this book the point is well emphasised paragraph after paragraph of otherwise good english is spoilt by the introduction of commas where full stops were needed the intrusions of semicolons into places where commas would have sufficed and similar jerks on the breath of the reader we may overlook an occasional split infinitive or faulty phrase for the sake of good subjectmatter but here is english as she should not be handled and we resent it the period is 1849 the place italy the hero is one leone who in the end gives his life for the cousin whom he loved in its personal scenes the story has airather melodramatic effect even for southern europe the characters are a little too stagey to be real and the mistakes arising out of the marvellous resemblance between philip sinclair and his brothermistakes which we know full well will be remedied in the last chapterdo not ring true on its historical side the novel provides good reading not so heavy as to weary the reader yet sufficiently detailed to attest its authors grip of a period difficult to follow in its intricate happenings we would recommend miss james to get a little manual on punctuation and also to beware of too much limelight in her next worklifelight gives better results at the same time while admitting its imperfections we welcome the present volume as pleasant holiday reading,war
ezction i d i whilehal or the days of charles the first an historical  romance bytthe author of  mwhitefriars the name of this novel indicates the time and place of the action it will also suggest the leading incidents the latter days of charles offer a fine field for the genius of the novelist but it needs a masterhand to do justice to the themepowers l such as the father of historical romance could alone have brought to the task to say of the author of whitehall that he has not entirely succeeded in his ambitious aim is to say of him only that he is not the greatest writer of his age and we frankly admit that it would be unfair to try him by an extraordinary standard compared with his contemporaries he is not inferior to any of theis in some of the qualities requisite for this class of literature he is equal to most of them in the accomplishments necessary for the production of fiction of any kind is descriptive powers are great  he has read up well for the occasion he has keen perceptions of the nicer shades of character and his soul is in his work so that he writes with the flow of a full mind and carries the reader onward by force of a certain energy which is felt although incapable of definition but these excellences are mingled with manifest faults his composition is often careless and ungraceful his plot is wanting in artistic skill  he resorts too much to the tricks of the novelist relies for his effects upon the unnatural or supernatural mistakes the wonderful for the grand and the melodramatic for the dramatic lie is copious of contrivances for any difficulty but they are so farfetched mo thoroughly beyond the bounds of probability that they offend the readers sense of propriety and often produce a smile where a striking surprise was intended this tendency of the writer to exaggerationthis convulsive straining after effect wau apparent in his previous novel but it has grown with his growth and is still more obvious and more repulsive here another fault he has fallen into in common with many of his predecessors he has been overanxious to press into his pages all the great personages of the time and to bring this about he has resorted to contrivances so out r so wild so out of the natural order of things that the design is made palpable to the reader whose interest in the affair departs the moment he is compelled to feel that all these good people have been brought together to show off the writer and not to ad vance the story it is in the strictly historical portions of the romance that the author excels ihe is skilful in dramatising actual events bringing them before us not as mere dry details of facts but with their accessories of men and manners and dialogues that paint them upon the fancy invested with a human interest and more like things we have seen than such as we have only read of the story begins with the battle of newbury and ends with the death of charles the hero is one ingulph an illegitimate son of the marquis of 0ontaclte a youth of brilliant talent favoured of the queen his brother born in wedlock is betrothed to marie one of the daughters of the earl of strafford but she is loved bv and loves our hero ingulph the jealousies and rivalries of these brothers are the staple of the plot de la pole the legitimates name is the villain of the story he practises all sorts of rascalities against his brother and by false charges has him sent to prison he escapes thence is taken prisoner by prince rlpert goes to london and meets imilton waller and other famous personages and is invited to join the plot of the latter failing in this de la pole accuses him of crimes of which he was the real author and almost succeeds when cromwell comes in time to save him takes him into his service patronizes and promotes him this takes him into the battle of naseby  he is entrusted with the custody of the king is appointed on the commission discovers that he is the kings natural son plots his escape is detected and witnesses his execution nevertheless with all its improbabilities and faults tfhitehall is a better novel than the generality of those that are issued to amuse the dull leisure

gesture recommended him to the care of axtel while he himself returned calmly to the executioner  i shall say but very short prayers and when i thrust out my handsthe masked executioner nodded with a deep sigh the bishop now handed the king a white satin nightcap but feeling his long grey hair he inquired of the executioner if it would be in his way the man made no reply but laid down his axe and assisted the bishop in adjusting it under the cap  i have a good cause and a gracious god on my side  he said to juxon smilingly when this fearful preparation was completed there is but one stage more

to your great joy the prize you hasten toa crown of glory 1  i go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown where no disturbance can be no disturbance in the world said charles mournfully as if retracing in his mind the turbulent events of his career y you are exchanged from a temporal to an eternal crowna good exchange  replied the bishop  is my hair well  said charles turning to the executioner lie nodded taking off his collar and insignia of the garter the king then handed it to juxoni saying the remarkable and ominous word which has ever since puzzled posterity remember  charles glanced at the block and the loose staples you must set it fast he observed it is fast sir replied the executioner charles looked at him for a moment but the impenetrable mask baffled his scrutiny knight of de la pole  he then said in a low tone  it might have been a little higher  it can be no higher sir said the assistant executioner observing that his master made no reply by this time axtel surprised at dethewarres making no effort to rise from his kneeling position shook him violently and startled him from a kind of insensibility rather of mind than body he arose and mechanically obeying the gestures of axtel followed him off the scaffold but as they entered the banqueting hall a low deep universal sigh was heard gradually rising among the mob he glanced backan

the silence of colonel bramble by andrt maurois translated from th french 5s netlane fashion in the covering of books with pictorial wrappers is sometimes misleading as in the case of  the silence of colonel bramble glancing at the cover one reader put the volume aside as a  war novel he took it up again minus the cleverly designed wrapper and discovered the book to be a work of peculiar charm and attraction a tender intimate witty presentation of a small group of british officers with their french interpreter companion the colonel the major the doctor the padre and aurelle these are the principal people whose talk we listen to as it is rendered by a french writer who must have learned to know the british with quite unusual thoroughness it is indeed by the ready ease of the writer in the presentation of his work that the french quality is noticeable rather than by anything in the point of view it suggests indeed such intimacy of understanding as is rare indeed the good stories easily and naturally introduced into the talk of the delightful five who mess together and listen after mr warwick deeping whose new novel second youth will be published this month by messrs cassell wards to the colonels gramophone give a curious air of reality to the group so cleverly vignetted against the lurid background of the war how the padre shot his lion is a delicious yarn and thoroughly characteristic is the authors close to the chapter of which that yarn is a part  aurelle rather dazed fuddled with the indian sun and the scent of wild animals at last realised that this world is a great park laid out by a gardener god for the gentlemen of the united kingdoms not since max orell was among us has there from edward wyndham tennant by his mother pamela glenconner john lane a second edition is now in the press edward wyndham tennant been such lovingly humorous presentation of british character by a french pen,war
macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,war
these men thy friends by edward thompson knopf 7s 6d what can the best customers of circulating libraries think of a book calling itself a novel in which the references to women would scarcely fill half a page  war books too have become wearisome to most of them they will do well however not to leave this story of the mespot campaign out of account even if the most definite impression left on their minds at the end may be of the lamentable effects of ignorance and want of imagination in too many wearers of  brass hats  and occupants of green benches at westminster if any one of the four men whose experiences and friendship pervade the book can be selected as a special hero it is hart the infantry commander who hating war is a splendid leader in battle and before he is finally shot down does more to win through by the confidence and affection of his men as well as by his professional knowledge and judgment than any dozen brave ruthless and fiery officers of the captain waggett type clearly depicted in these pages history plays a large part in the story and in some cases the conduct of famous commanders who are named is distinctly challenged it is not the incidents of war that will chiefly concern the more thoughtful readers of the book but the moral and spiritual adventures of the men with whom for a few hours they will live the exchanges of ideas and the solitary reflections over hard and cruel facts of existence,war
fr0m0nt jeune et risler atne fromont jeune et rider abie moeurs parisiennes par alphonse baudet paris  charpentier et cic 1875 m daudets last novel has obtained and may be fairly said to have deserved considerable success it is a book which amuses and interests while one reads it but in which one cannot but discover a variety of faults on after reflection for instance the author displays a certain poverty of invention in taking the disregard of the seventh commandment as the mainspring of his story  toujours ladultere a french critic cried in despair at seeing a new domestic drama  and indeed the subject has been worn very nearly threadbare we must not flinch from our duty say a certain class of romance and play writers there are malignant diseases which arc gnawing at the very heart of society  it devolves upon us however painful we may find it to lay bare the source of the evil this is all very fine and it makes an interesting picture to imagine alexandre dumas the son for instance convulsed with grief but battling manfully with it as he fulfils his terrible task of unveiling the horrors of vice which he discovers to his audiences or readers but it is natural to suspect that the writers who continually stand forth armed with the caustic which they will not shrink from applying to their countrys wounds feel some anxiety to keep themselves and their great object before the eyes of the public and thus they may grow to resemble quack doctors who having invented a marvellous cure find it desirable to keep up in appearance at least a supply of disease which may demand their skill it may also be supposed that to most writers it is easier to make a story out of the distorted state of things arising from illicit love than out of more tranquil conditions it is greatly to be regretted that a writer of m dumass power should not attempt to deal with some newer and pleasanter subject than that of illicit love one cannot help entertaining a hope that his new play lfitrangere the production of which has been delayed by m delaunays severe illness may have some fresh and less sordid motive than is found in his others besides the fact that m daudet has chosen a weuworn theme for the motive of his romance a fault which is certainly not peculiar to him there are other points where there is a want of originality in his story the device for example by which the woman who plays the most important part in it gets rid of a man who threatens to reveal her perfidy is so exactly like that employed by the comtesse de chalis in m feydeaus novel under the same circumstances that one cannot but think the one suggested the other sidonie chebe or sidonie risler as she has become when the story opens is a kind of becky sharpe that is she has becky sharpes love of luxury and finery and utter absence of principle but she has besides this a vulgarity and stupidity which make it difficult to believe in the powers of fascination which she exercises upon various people it is not upon her own cleverness but upon the dullness and brutality of others that ethe depends for success she begins her career with nearly succeeding in marrying georges fromont of the great manufacturing house of fromont for which chance she throws over frantz risler who in despair takes an engineering appointment abroad then her project of marrying fromont is destroyed by his carrying out a longarranged plan of his family and marrying his cousin after this risler aim frantss brother is promoted to a partnership in though bouse of fromont and then sidonie with tears and blushes confesses that it is the elder risler whom she has always loved and that she only accepted frantz risler because he was the next thing to his brother the worthy risler is overjoyed sit his good fortune and exclaims as he does on all occasions which mvp him delight je sins content the secucl is that sidonie gets georges fromont info her clutches and all but ruins the house by the extravagances wbich sbe induces him to commit  while risler is so persistently blind and deaf that even bis oldest friends suspect him of complicity in a vile contract by one of these friends frantz is recalled to set mattersstraight if possible and of him sidonie disposes by the trick already mentioned as seeming to be suggested by the comtesse de chalis the difference is that in m fcydeaus novel the incident is probable enough while in m daudets it is grossly unnatural had be succeeded in conveying to his readers the notion of any kind of attraction in sidonie it would be possible to accept the triumph of her manoeuvres as possible as it is one is lost in wonder at ber having found so many stupid people as victims for her impositions the strongest scene in the book is that in which his wifes faithlessness suddenly breaks upon risler and in this there is certainly some power but its incidents resemble so much those of the scene between lord steyne and rawdon crawley that the impression first given by sidonies character of m daudet having carefully studied  vanity fair is confirmed it is in little bits of observation and in the drawing of characters who only affect his plot incidentally that m daudet has made a real success sidonie is like a coarse copy of becky sharpe risler is aggravatingly humble and stupid  but sidonies mean lazy father and mdme dobson the languishing singingmistress who herself the most respectable of persons delights to live in an atmosphere of intrigue are living people the best character in the book however is undoubtedly delobelle a  proud parrotting player to quote the puritans ordinance against actors who having come np from the provinces to paris to make his fortune has remained for many years strutting on the boulevard never getting an engagement never losing confidence in his own great powers and supported by the work of his wife and daughter whose belief in him is almost equal to his own his unconscious selfishness his overweening vanity and his many weaknesses are hit off by the author with a keen perception and a light touch on one occasion he nearly persuades risler to invest money in a theatre

a soldier of manhattan by joseph a altsheler smith elder  cothere seems to be a sort of convention about historical novels dealing with war and fighting which is convenient and amusing the hero is almost invariably in love with a highborn damsel on the other side who is already engaged to a villain on her own sidethe rest is obvious consequently the whole point of the book lies in the circumstances here the circumstances are exciting enough as they relate to the taking of quebec by general wolfe and though campaign preceding it mr gilbert parker has written a novel on the same events but this book in no way trenches on his ground as it is entirely written from the english or rather the american point of view in fact mr altsheler seems somewhat concerned in dwelling on the merits of the colonist as opposed to the english soldiers in this war but this is quite by the way and does not interfere with the really exciting adventures of lieut charteris in his encounters with indian and french sharpshooters as a french prisoner in his escape from quebec with a halfcaste and in the final attack on montcalms position it is an exciting book vividly written in which the hero performs all that such a hero should do with courage and modesty the pseudonym knarf elivas is really a fair sample of the extent of the ingenuity of the author of the story of john ship mariner a romance of the faroe isles sampson low  co it is an historical romance and contains a hero a heroine a villain the inquisition a shipwreck and a sunken treasurein short all the good old materials treated in the bad old way there is a subtle suggestion about the book as of something one has met before and a clear impression that one would rather not meet it again  a soldier of manhattan and his adventures at ticonderoga and quebec by joseph a altsheler smith elder  co the home supply of historical novels is so large that we cannot see any reason why it should be reinforced from abroadparticularly if the novel is of indifferent quality mr joseph a altsheler we take it is a native of the united states of america and his soldier of manhattan is of very indifferent quality indeednay more it may be justly described in common parlance as  pretty bad his story covers about the same ground as robert louis stevensons fine ballad about ticonderogalike that it even introduces a highland officerand gilbert parkers seats of the mighty and by comparison even with the latter his performance is not worth mention but there is a point of view from which it may well be taken note of though only to be condemned mr joseph a altsheler would seem to have told his story for no other purpose than to prove that the american soldier was in those troublous times of george m not only as good as the british but a darned sight betterthe which is supererogatory at this time of day and altogether beside any purpose of art there is a british officer named culverhouse who is clearly meant to be goodnatured stupid conceited and entirely typical of his country here is a passage concerning an adventure of a scouting party in the backwoods of which culverhouse is one and zebedee a backwoods  boy is another  we paused again by a little brook that whispered a song as it threw coils of silver over the pebbles  i suggest that we go no further said culverhouse as he gasped for breath  it is not becoming in an officer in his majestys service to fly thus from any danger at all far less from any danger that he cannot see and that he does not even know to exist  the dangers real enough i tell you said zebedee  them woods behind you are swarming with the hurons an they mean to have us  i suppose its as you say said culverhouse  im willing to admit i do not know much about this manner of making war 1 what queer people these red fellows are  said culverhouse again meditatively  and how they violate all the rules of war     and what a sanguinary desire they evince to obtain our scalps  continued culverhouse he felt for his hair which was very abundant and then said ruefully to me  to think i should be threatened with such a fate i who have danced with a princess of the blood royal there is a good deal more of such skimbleskamble stuff which sets forth no possible person at all but a creature of mere farce and of farce with an animus,war
new novels the tory lover by sarah  rne jewett smith elder  co the authors real hero is that renegade scotsman john paul or paul jones but one can understand a good deal of sentiment in his favour from an american author here he appears as a gallant lover and perfect cavalier though his rough methods at sea are not ignored perhaps the story would have gained interest had joness really valiant fight with the serapis been included in its scope his raid with the ranger strikes one as rather impudent than heroic though he did get lady stirlings silver spoons and frighten the fishermen at whitehaven the tory lover the nominal hero is not wholly satisfactory he sails with jones against his inclinations in order to win the fair patriot mary hamilton and the best part of the book deals with his life at sea and the false position of a gentleman and a loyalist in such a galley it must be acknowledged that the lady is a prize worth winning miss jowett has a happy gift of description and the old colonial families she introduces with their neighbours and quaint dependents are aptly depicted  the tory lover bv sarah orne tewett 6s smith elder the most substantial and what matters more to the general public the most readable historical novels are now made in america within the last vear or two miss johnstone mr winston churchill and mr chambers have won real success in this field and now the wellknown writer miss orne jewett bids fair to rival them her tale is of the american war of independence and when we say that one of the principal personages that figure in it is the renowned paul jones expectations of romance will run high nor will they be disappointed yet frankly we miss something of the fire and dash of the capitaine paul of dumas tale and in mr churchills conception of him there was more subtlety miss jewett however inspires great vmpathy in miary hanilton the herolni of the tory loverl trprodued by kindperauissian of xtisrs smith elder and lo us for her particular privateer she exhibits him a  harassed man also as an unlucky lover rather than in his hour of victory but by emphasising hi magnanimity and hi generous public spirit she keeps him fast in his romantic place indeed his little outbursts of temper which she reveals are almost needed to make him seem real enough to hold his own on the quarterdeck but he is not the hero of the book miss jewett has risked failure by making wallingford sit on the fence at the beginning of the struggle and only go over definitely to one side at the prayer of the lovely mlarn hamilton and for his mothers safety it is difficult to take a keen interest in anyone so halfhearted but when we see him fulfil the pledges loyally he has taken against his will watched him the faithful lieutenant of paul jones and suffering under wrongful suspicion after the attack on whitehaven he rises into a wcrthy hero for the excellent story and yet we grudge him to the charming mary and wax melancholy over the disappointment of the gallant privateer,war
st ives being the adventures of a frenth prisoner in england by robert louis stevenson heinemann tnis is a rattling touchandgo tale of adventure of a somewhat ordinary type yet relieved by some fine but slight studies in characterization that it will not add to stevensons reputation is clear from this description as well as from his own doubts about the book already published to the world in the  vailima letters whether it was altogether wise of his executors to publish it admits of some doubt yet after all it will not lower if it will not enhance his reputation and it is of course far above the average trade novels that pour forth in such increasing floods from the press perhaps the most remarkable and significant thing about the book is the skill with which mr quiller couch has supplied the last bu chapters which both in style and briskness of treatment bear an astonishing resemblance to the preceding thirty it was a dangerous and difficult task that mr quiller couch undertook and to some it might seem of disputable taste but he has come out of the ordeal triumphantly and for once a patch has proved to be not altogether a botch take for example the following passage in which the hero is forced for a purpose to simulate drunkenness  doubtless by my uncovered head and gala dress he judged me an allnight revellera strayed bacchanal fooling in the morrows eye prompt upon the inference came inspiration i must win to the centre of the crowd and a crowd is invariably indulgent to a drunkard i hung out the glaring signboard of crapulous glee lurching hiccoughing jostling apologising to all and sundry with spacious incoherence i plunged my way through the sightseers and they gave me passage with all the good humour in life this has the true stevensonian accent the unexpected adjectives the double accusatives the metaphoric signboard all are just in stevensons style as for the matter of the supernumerary chapters they appear to have been supplied from the memory of mrs strong stevensons amanuensis and their episodical character is merely on a par with the rest of the work the tale as its subtitle indicates tells the story of the adventures of a french prisoner in england and scotland just before napoleons first downfall but the viscount anne de st yves de keroual the french prisoner in question is of somewhat curious upbringing he had had an english nurse and ample opportunities of learning english which he talked with scarcely perceptible accent but the training in english seems to have gone somewhat deeper that the mere language for it is only occasionally throughout the book that he remembers that he is a frenchman and a french soldier to boot and altogether he is by no means convincing in his title rdle he is a dandy and is curious in waistcoats yet there is something raffish about his bearing a quality which he shares with his cousin the elder viscount de st yves who is the rather pinchbeck villain of the story altogether it is difficult to believe that a hero such as this could have won the heart of a highspirited scotch girl after two or three interviews the fact is this book bears the mark of a fggel aiinl on almost every page of it it is largely reminiscent of other works of the same writer the interview which the heroines brother has with the hero resembles closely a scene in  beau austin the escape from edinburgh castle has its counterpart in a similar escape in  the black arrow the villain viscount is a faint copy of the master of ballantrae the counting up of the treasure recalls the last pages of treasure island the fight with the drovers is a similar incident to the attack by clunys men in kidnapped rowleys flageolet takes the place of the penny whistle of the carrier in  the wrong box while the friendly relations of the hero with that burly villain burchell fenn had previous existence in the pages of  the wrecker and so throughout the majority of incidents recall similar passages in stevensons earlier books and prove that while be was occupied in writing st ives his mind had lost its power of fresh combination that the loss was only temporary that vigorous fragment  weir of hermiston is more than sufficient proof little fresh as are the incidents they are even less well considered and connected the story is practically of an escaped military prisoner who travels from edinburgh to his uncles place in the south and then returns to the northern capital the motive for the return is supposed to be an invincible desire to see the loved one but the coxcomb tone in which the fair one is wooed does not make this return at risk of death any the more probable stevenson may possibly have felt this as he props up the motive with a somewhat trumpery charge of assault in which others might be implicated for the heros sake but even this is only brought in as an afterthought for it could not have been made the principal motive or else the attractive power of love would have been so much diminished when st ives gets to edinburgh again where he is wanted for an alleged murder really the result of a duel he naturally falls into great dangers from which he ultimately escapes by the most mechanical of methods a casual balloon that wafts him away to the bristol channel altogether the book regarded from the point of view of plot is a panorama of improbabilities nor on the character side is there much to attract we have already referred to though unconvincing nature of the heros position as an angloscotch frenchman the heroine is somewhat of a lay figure more care has been taken with the villain but he is after all merely a lath that is not even painted to look like iron and in the relations of the hero either to heroine or villain there is nothing inevitable nothing that could not be otherwise yet unsatisfactory as the book is both in construction and characterization it has an interest of its own to the student of stevensons art previous to this book his studies in characterization were somewhat forced and he had clearly to content himself with but a few figures on the stage he characterised with deeficulty but here at last he began to show himself a compeer of the masters in that quality in which they specially proved their mastery what distinguishes fielding scott dickens thackeray and even charles read to a certain extent is the ease and fecundity with which they create minor characters it is possible they crowd their canvases too much but the total result is to produce that effect of bustling life which it is the peculiar function of the novelist to reproduce here in  st ives stevenson for the first time came to his own in this respect it is crowded with subordinate figures the majority of them alive and some of them uproariously kicking there is major chevenix the heros rival a dry stick but a gentlemanly the heroines aunt miss gilchrist is crabbed and caustic but goodnatured at bottom rowley the boy valet is scarcely the success that the pains devoted to him would warrant but he is certainly alive one of the minor characters a french colonel who had broken parole in order to reach the deathbed of his only daughter sounds a note of almost tragic intensity but whether it be a postboy demanding blackmail or a runaway bride who is sorry she has run away or an attorneys clerk who has touches of patriotism or an edinburgh buck who is professor of nonsense in an imaginary universitywhether they are portrayed in fewor in many linesalmost every character introduced has the tang of individuality stevenson must have felt some of this increased capacity himself for he has been so greatly daring as to introduce as one of his minor characters no less a person than walter scott himself the passage in which he appears is short and slight but may be here quoted as an instance of perhaps the most characteristic thing about  st ives the evidence it gives of the capacity of indicating character by a few traits   our encounter was of a tall stoutish elderly gentleman a little grizzled and of a rugged but cheerful and engaging countenance he sat on a hill pony wrapped in a plaid over his green coat and was accompanied by a horsewoman his daughter a young lady of the most charming appearance they overtook us on a stretch of heath reined up as they came alongside and accompanied us for perhaps a quarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the hillsides to our left great was my amazement to find the unconquerable mr sim thaw immediately on the accost of this strange gentleman who hailed him with a ready familiarity proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of droving and the prices of cattle and did not disdain to take a pinch from the inevitable rams horn presently i was aware that the strangers eye was directed on myself  and there ensued a conversation some of which i could not help overhearing at the time and the rest i have pieced together more or less plausibly from the report of sim   surely that must be an amateur drover ye have gotten there the gentleman seems to have asked sim replied 1 was a young gentleman that had a reason of his own to travel privately well well ye must tell me nothing of that i am in the law you know and tace is the latin fora candle answered the gentleman  but i hope its nothing bad sim told him it was no more than debt   oh lord if that be all  cried the gentleman  and turning to myself  well sir he added i understand you are taking a tramp through our forest here for the pleasure of the thing i  why yes sir said i  and i must say i am very well entertained   i envy you said he i have jogged many miles of it myself when i was younger my youth lies buried about here under every heatherbush like the soul of the licentiate lucius but you should have a guide the pleasure of this country is much in the legends which grow as plentiful as blackberries and directing my attention to a little fragment of a broken wall no greater than a tombstone he told me for an example a story of its earlier inhabitants presently after giving us a cigar apiece scott bade us farewell and disappeared with his daughter over the hills and when i applied to sim for information his answer of  the shirra man  abode kens the shirra  told me unfortunately nothing the incident is slight enough in all conscience but every touch tells and the whole impression is one of life it is perhaps worth while mentioning that the word cigar is here spelled otherwise than in the rest of the book where it has the old spelling segar there are also some anachronisms of fact and tone and what is probably a misprint on p 92  usuriousness for uxoriousness these discrepancies would doubtless have been removed if stevenson had lived to revise the proofs but no amount of revision could have made up for the want of cohesion in the plot the inefficient colouring of the chief characters it is needless to say that in speaking in these somewhat slighting terms of  st ives wear judging it by a high standard whether destined to be classic or no there is no doubt that stevensons work stands out markedly from the ruck of machinemade fiction and this very book with all its faults shows that he was slowly maturing to a mastery of his art which might have raised him to an equality with the greatest of the past,war

the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to

run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always the same with you people he cannot pay something   he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you   alas no monseigneur  but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass well  monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass again well she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition is that a morsel of stone or wood with my husband name may  be placed over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will  be quickly forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the  same malady i shall be laid undw some other heap of poor grass i monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much  want monseigneur monseigneur j the valet had put ber away from the door the carriage had broken n into a bruk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left fg far behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly  diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau i  distinctly present to the taney of the writer must have 11 g ly  been that scene of the taking of the bastille which is here is j made present to the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to the story of doctor manette as to the history of france here again is a little picture of saint antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sance to wretched bread  yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarges wineshop parted with its  last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door  at last it is come my dear f eh well returned madame  almost how admirable is the picture of the rise of power io the doctor when the day comes that makes the great horror of his life a means of blessing to his child by giving him influence as a bastille prisoner over the storm that threatens shipwreck of her dearest hopes he relapses when a second wave against which all bis skill is powerless breaks over her head aud the knot is at last solved by sydney cartou the exquisite poetry of the touches which detail to us j the manner of his sacrifice with the honour and trust  of an innocent girl to strengthen him in his last moment is worthy to be the close of a tale nobly sustained to the latest word a few touches here and there may be in excess  we are hardly content for example that it should occur to miss pros at a critical moment to compare madame defarge s eyes to bed winches  but

mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and his only child to explain their views and positions  papa

downtrodden insulted plundered race of pariahs and helots if i could orgaise negro labour in louisiana on a basis jut and profitable to all partieishould consider myself more honoured than by being made president of the united ates in ordinary times if i could be the means of educating their darkened minds and consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his child how tender is his care for her how devoted his attachment i how pleasant and how playful his manner yet always so full of sympathy and wathful love  he and colbourn the volunteer captain are both made superior to ordinary mortals they can be hardhearted to themselves but they are always tenderhearted to their neighbours the cut the burden of their own troubles and griefs behind their backs that they may sympathies with those of their friends the virtues of the parent ae reflected in his child lmeli is the worthy daughter of such a father the gaiety of her temper is the charucteristic which chiefly charms the reder the personal beauty which exercises so potent a spell over all with whom she has to do cannot really afford any particular pleasure to one who only reads

8ing any weight to the counsels of his maturejudgment ei stoo impetuous but this is just henat eec of such a caatr the views of a ldier life seem to us photo r al the details are brought out so vividly the enn and tediousn of life in camp the restraint of discipline and the frequent negligenes of volunteers the reckless rush of some to the charge whilst others are skulking behind the terrors of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special qualification we have on our table thc epistle

strange true stones of zoiiaia by george w cve kegan tiltia co all men except a few belated partisans of slavery will be sure to welcome this charming biok from the chronicler of old creole days the work is doubly valuable because mr cable the romancer has suppressed himself so much in order to make room for mr cable the faithful and capable editor the tales in this volume are in one way superior even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed romance have been faithfully translated or preserved whore this firsthand eviience is unattainable the romancer in deposing the editor has nevertheless chosen some true tradition for the groundwork of his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie brouillard the last is the best and the first as decidedly the weakest  salome muller  is loosely and lengthily spun ou end is hardly worthy of so skilled a practitioner as mr cable it also makes too heavy a call upon our interest in the extinct legal luminaries of new orleans fifty years ago too much is said about these phantoms and they are no convincingly reanimated  though the advocate christian roselius deserves his niche for his long duel in behalf of a most injured woman frankly what attracts us most in this and the succeeding stories is less the story itself than mr cables own combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables pencil at its best it must suffice to extract from attalie brouillard a description of the rascal quadroon camille dur our  fancy a small figure thin let us say narrowchested roundshouldered his complexion a dull clay colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own and his linen last weeks it doss not appear whether mr cable has any authority for these traits  but somebody mut surely have sat for such a portrait which we treasure as a bright scrap of reality a living face though it be but a sorry scoundrels saved from oblivion how great i the contrast between this trained portraiture of nature and the remaining four papers where nature herself meets us in all her leisurely process her repetitions her thrilling surprises produced by simple expedients these papers ere all written by women they are translated in three case and abridged in one but otherwise are published intact ajd says the editor without restorations the first bearing the somewhat srevensoniau title of  the young aunt with white hair 13 a translation only seven pages long of a letter written in 1782 by a french emigrie she was seized by indians near the mouth of the mississippi saw ber husband and child dashed down before her eyes wai herself halfflayed at the stake and was only saved from the chiefs dinnertable by a rescuing patty at the eleventh hour the language of the letter is naif and desperate and is in strong contract to mr cables own ornamental and sometimes laboured style it is only a pity that sa little could be printed of the french originals for the sake of their illspelt cager utterance the translations in most cases read well save that mr cable either in order to flavour his diction or from a mistaken idea of translators fidelity sometimes renders french too literally for instance abner did not sparc of beautiful presents   and again the sentence  these

antislavery convictions independently while ever body round her was discharging infinite and furious rant against the slve and his liberators she suffered much from her friends but she kept the faith

she meets discomfort and danger in the detested cause few diaries exhibit such boundless pluck and few such unconsciousness of being at all exceptional it is not till the last page that we learn

alice lorraine alice lorraine a tale of the south downs by r d blackmore author of  the maid of sker c london sampson low and co mr blackmore almost makes us breathe the healthful air of the south downs in the pages of this novel we rise refreshed and inspirited fiom the perusal of these three enticing volumesa result which has become so unusual latterly with readers of works of fiction as the story ran through the pages of blackwood it had many admirers and it is not too much to say that mr blackmore has never produced superior work in ilorna doone there were more striking passages of natural description possibly and in  the maid of sker there was at least one character of more intense individuality but the present novel is remarkable for its general merit given unquestionable genius at the outsetwhich mr blackmore possesseswe should expect an author to ripen in this manner so that his work while it may not impress us for the force of any single attribute will leave upon us a very distinct idea of power that a novel should be styled a worthy suc cessor to the two works we have just named is no mean tribute yet it is one which we are able to pay on the present occasion in the fullest and frankest manner one point has especially struck us in relation to the present story and that is the utter lack of straining after effect either by a spasmodic brilliancy of style or sensationalism of plot the gentleman and the scholar are alike perceptible in every chapter and we are never in a state of dubiety as to the healthy morality he would teach of absolute flinging of moral lessons at the head of the reader there is indeed very little but the whole might very well be placed before the hysterical and sensuous school who having gratified the lower passions of their readers throw an occasional sop to the almighty by patronising religion the true end of the novelist mr blackmore always keeps in viewnamely that of telling the unvarnished history of any character he undertakes to depict one incident at the close of his latest story would in other hands have appeared unreal and grotesque but the author has so manipulated it that it adds to the effect of his work the lorraines of coombe lorraine were a very old family possessing undoubted records of their abode in the land for centuries there was always from the time of baronets either a sir roland sir hilary

course of love ends oz returning to coombe lorraine hilary endeavours to persuade his father in favour of mabel sir roland owever will not permit him to descant upon her numerous virtues and concludes in this strain let th wings of imagination spread themselves in a more favourable direction this interview must close on my part with a suggestive but perhaps selfevident proposition hilary the door is open hilary avails himself of the parental suggestion and goes off to the war in the peninsula as he finds he cannot give up his love for the growers daughter the young recruit covers himself with glory at ciudad rodrigo and other places and becomes very popular with all the fellows in his regiment on one occasion he gets desperately wounded and is tended during his illness by the lovely daughters of the count of zamora one of these goes very near wounding him deeply in the region of the heart and he does not get released from his entanglement except at a very severe cost she is the means of his losing 50000 guineas the property of the british army for which he is cashiered by the duke of wellington he afterwards however recovers his credit meanwhile during this history what has become of the heroine who gives the title to the book  alice is a truly noble highspirited girl a proposition is made to her by her grandmotherwho eventually obtains sir rolands consent to the matchthat she should marry captain chapman the disreputable son of sir remnant chapman a landowner who has got possession of too many of the lorraine acres lady valeria lorraine thinks this would be an excellent way of recovering them alice ventures to think otherwise but in the end being persuaded that the honour of the house requires it she consents to sacrifice herself on the morning of the weddingday nevertheless she casts herself into the woeburn a stream which has always been a dreaded one with the lorraines on being drawn from the river after she has fulfilled the prediction of the astrologeronly this can save lorraine one must plunge to rescue twainshe remains for several hours apparently lifeless but the heart at length resumes its office and she is recovered sir roland lorraine is stricken with illness when he learns of his daughters supposed suicide a happy event hastens the story to a happy end mabel lovejoy has an immense fortune left to her which is generously given to the lorraines by her father and hersolf and alice and hilary are thus both savedthe former to marry major aylmer a brave british officer and the latter to reconcile sir roland to his union with mabel the above is the merest outline of the story and gives no idea of the quantity of byplay which runs through the volumes some of the best drawn characters are those which are least prominent notably the rev struan hales a sporting parson of the old type and bonny a boy wvho owns a donkey which may lay claim to more intelligence than we should be willing to concede to half the human race these three sketches of two bipeds and one quadruped are  really inimitable and serve as an outlet for mr blackmores peculiar vein of humour we wish it were our fate to read more novels of this description  a terror would then pass into a joy alice lorraine is a book it would be impossible to feel dull over it contains riot a single nninterestimig clhalptr and undoubtedly sustains its

  the seats of the mighty by gilbert parker methuen  co mr parker seems to become stronger and easier with every serious novel that he attempts good though some of his earlier efforts were there was generally a sense of  tightness  to use an expression borrowed from drawing about his works which to some extent marred their effect he also has had a tendency to study somewhat abnormal and ingenious characters for which he is in no way to be reproached although it to a certain extent exaggerated in him an inclination to artificiality however singularities such as these are no faults but rather merits in a young author for the worst thing they produce is overelaboration a failing soon cured by time and experience in  the seats of the mighty mr parker shows the matured power which his former novels have led us to expect and has produced a really fine historical novel the scene of course is laid in canada and the central fact chosen is the glorious capture of quebec by general wolfe mr parker perhaps wisely does not make the general the chief figure in his story but he shows enough of him to make more intelligible and real the extraordinary heroism and attraction in this physically weak man i but the great creation of the book is doltaire the bastard of a french king and a peasant woman who combines in an extraordinary manner the dignity courtesy and cynicism of the old court with the rude directness and occasional savagery of the soil his character is drawn with quite masterly strokes for he is a villain who is not altogether a villain and who attracts the reader as he did the other characters by the extraordinary brilliancy of his gifts and by the almost unconscious acts of nobility which he performs there is nothing overdone about him  ono can understand fully why he was so successful and why he almost succeeded in fascinating the heroine and one can equally understand the loathing felt for him by the hero capt moray and his fine doath is not unworthy of his life capt moray himself is by no means the shadowy creature that the hero of an historical novel is apt to be his sufferings in prison are well told and his exploits during the escape down the st lawrence river and in his brief return to quebec are almost worthy of dumas for their foolhardy ingenuity most sincerely is mr parker to be congratulated on the finest novel he has yet written,war
richard carvel american fiction by winston churchill macmillan  of the inevitable comparison between this and thackerays celebrated volumes nothing shall be said in this place this romance of the old maryland days though not a masterpiece is good enough to stand on its own merits there is a vigorous swing in the way of telling the story and not a little life and movement it is certainly too long and there is a plethora rather than a poverty of event and episode on the whole however  richard carvel is a more than fairly entertaining specimen of the average historical novel the time is about a hundred and fifty years ago and the localities maryland and london the interest centres on the colonial period of the united states history and the scenes in and about london introduce wellknown figures and their resorts the story is in the nature of a lively and spirited romance conceived with an eye to broad effects carried out with some idea of big masses and scenic light and shadow there is besides a good deal of play of character richard carvels grandfather the old maryland gentleman with his blind faith in a king who is only one in name is a superior study in types of the past richard who tells his own story does it in interesting fashion and is himself more of a human being as well as hero than many of those forced to play the part in recent volumes his courage and sense of honour are simple and unpretentious yet conspicuous the heroine in spite of suggestions as of an innocent beatrix esmond is not without traits of character quite her own the number of stirring and eventful scenes here and in america serve to make the book seem shorter than it really is the author has daringly but not unconvincingly introduced some wellknown faces fox horace walpole and particularly paul jones are a good deal in evidence the fortunes of the last are ingeniously interwoven i with the thread of narrative and the international troubles of those days if one now and then wearies of the ramifications of a story running to something over five hundred pages one gets in return a good deal in the shape of amusing or instructive information about a time and circumstances less written up  than born others the illustrations are poor and therefore superfluous in one we have a landsmans notion of a boom blocks and mainsail and some crude ideas about perspective generally  richard carvel by winston churchill 6s rhe mac miliae company there is good ground for honest congratulation of the young author of  richard carvel it is an historical romance on a difficult model which yet never shames its model either in matter or in style there is a much greater gravity and dignity in it than in most stories of its kind written today but this is not attained at the cost of liveliness we have read it with growing interest for the narratives sake and pleasure for th9 promise it displays 1 esmond  has determined its manner and design and that this fact has not taken the life out of the story is much to mr churchills credit richard carvel is a young american who goes through the great revolutionary struggle of a loyalist family he cherishes republican principles himself and his pictures of the times are thereforevaried and impartial his adventures include many in england and an intimate acquaintance with men so diverse ascharles james fox and paul jones the historical portraits are capital a great deal of work has been spent on them and not of an elementary kind either romantic readers may think he has emphasised the snobbishness and the vanity of  le capitaine paul but his estimate of that great sailor s lower qualities is no harsher than they will find in laughton while his genius and his service to the american navy never lack appreciation the glimpses of fox reflect no little of the charm of that fascinating personage for the rest  richard carvel  is a spirited tale of wandering and adventure with a wholesome lovestory to keep it fresh and sweet and provide for it a happy end,war

the yellow war by  blackwood 6s from the readers standpoint a single letter of the alphabet is an unsatisfactory pseudonym almost indecent in its brevity it stands in the case of the author of  the yellow war defying with an air of surprise any attempt at inquisitiveness nor is there much internal evidence to afford any clue to the identity of  o except that he was a person who had unusual facilities for getting about in the neighbourhood of the operations in the far east at chinampo in april at tokio in july at yinkow in september and so onit is permissible to guess at the secret but not to reveal it most of the sketches which are contained in this book have already appeared in i blackwoods magazine but they gain by being republished for although there is no connecting link to join them together they form a series of word pictures of the war it is not a gruesome book full of realistic details of wounds and other untidy things which are best kept behind the scenes nor is it a profound study in psychology like the  red badge of courage but it is a book which gives an excellent idea of the actors in the war one of the longest tales in the book for instance entitled  the path in the east is strange gives in a new way some idea of the japanese character it tells of a japanese man who is discovered in various circumstances at a diplomatic soiree as a cambridge undergraduate as a barber at tientsin and finally at the war it is an allegory to show the persistence of the national character and the willingness of the individual to serve the state incidentally in the story there is a little bit of pedantry about university candidates for the army anu education in general nothing thank heaven about compulsory greek which recalls a trick displayed in  on the heels of de wet by  the intelligence officer,war

book notices fiction the work of j c snaith mistress dorothy marvi n lady barbarity ward lock iq i  fortune nelson 1910 araminta mrs fitz smith elder i910 william jordan junior henry nortiecote broke of covenden constable 19068 perhaps if we knew the exact dates on which the above books were severally written we should find the duality of the author less perplexing by virtue of three books published by messrs constable a year or two ago mr snaith ranks with messrs wells conrad bennett and galsworthy as the fifth great novelist of our age his other books are amusing clever wellwritten wellcomposedall thats merry and bright and they bear about the same relation to literature as mr rackhams illustrations do to art araminta is the best of themthe style is pretty and the idea graceful but the work is too superficial to pass for comedy it has not the touch of merediths short stories mrs fitz again has its good scenesthe naughtiness of the king of illyria is delightfulbut the book is an obvious potboiler the character of sir richard pendragon in fortunt is whimsical and stirring but even in this very jolly book it is obvious that mr snaith does not take himself seriously as a writer of romance he does not approach his work with the imperturbable seriousness of dumas or stevenson his romances are as void of any undercurrent of thought or passion as those of cutcliffe hyne or conan doyle ingenuity seeks in vain for one fiery outburst from the author of william 7ordan for one surpassing phrase to electrify this pleasant business of love and adventure knights and highwaymen it is hard to believe that the same pen that wrote such commonplace as mistress dorothy alarvin has given us two immortal descriptions of heroes who denied the world to save their genius what of it  it is enough for one lifetime to have produced broke of covinden henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior of these books the first alone has achieved any measure of success or fame it is the earliest worst written and least important yet it has fine comedy and profound tragedy the influence of meredith is very apparent in the picture of broke a more rigid more passionate stupider sir willoughby patterne in one passage an invocation to the audience at the olympian theatre the author lapses into a travesty of merediths very style the tutor one of natures gentlemen and gods poets who rescues the youngest most intelligent and least ugly of brokes six daughters from the horrors of a manage de cowenance is closely modelled on vernon whitford all this detracts a little from the excellence of the book and certain abominations of style which have also to be mentioned detract from it still more take for instance this sentence  a gallant but intrepid hound who took a somewhat informal departure from this life because he chose to cross a railway when hounds were in full cry at the moment the express from london had chosen to cross it also this is terrible we hear too of  a game rejoicing in the euphonious name of pingpong and of  that mysterious zoological specimen the consummate ass dickens himself never committed worse excesses than these in the way of cheap irony and we may add that mr snaith would be well advised to go through all his books and scratch out the word  somewhat  wherever it occurs nevertheless there is grandeur in the scheme of broke of covenden it is thrilling to read how blow upon blow fell upon the all but indomitable pride of the hero and not till the end will lie vield and the characters are more vivid more passionate than merediths meredith would never have shown us the fire in delias soul admirable too is uncle charles a bibulous and kindhearted nobleman beloved by everyone but his wife a literary lady who writes for the spectator whose character the author draws with more ferocity than finesse in a humorous chapter this insufferable dame is smacked by her longsuffering husband alas that the author should add  not in the authentic place  broke of covenden may then be classed as a fine book but imitative henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior resemble nothing but each other written in a style of fantastic beauty they both describe the soul of genius battling to keep its purity untainted in the material world they are spiritual tragedies already in broke of covenden the author is apt to make his characters speak not as they would have spoken but rather as their souls would have spoken already in the description of brokes final desolation we have a foretaste of the authors power of expressing the psychical  there were occasional fierce gushes of rain driven by the wind against the windowpanes of the cottage he mistook them for waves of blood breaking over the walls of his mind in the two later books the whole atmosphere is spiritual the real things are the things of the soul and the phenomenal world becomes a hideous and obscuring dream henry northcote is an advocate penniless and unknown in the prelude a dying and destitute stranger who has heard his oratory in hyde park comes to visit him they talk together about jesus and the need of a new failure a great renunciator like him  to restore the sense of illusion and to show that the strife for the perfect is not a chimaera of the madhouse the stranger vanishes and the same night northcote is given his chance he is to defend a prostitute from a charge of murder the case seems as hopeless as it is sordid the woman is guilty beyond all doubt but to northcote it seems an unholy thing that a woman should be hanged he exerts his amazing genius and procures a verdict of  not guilty the trial scene is dramatic and northcotes speech with its vision of an ideal jury and christ as foreman is great literature but northcote realises that he has worked not for his ideal but for himself his ideal self dies and the ideal self of the woman he has rescued perishes at the same time we leave him an incendiary and a murderer established on the road to worldly success the grim story is relieved by passages of a peculiar humour a humour that reminds one now of dickens now of baudelaires poemes en prose and like the book itself baffles all description hard as it is to give an account of henry northcote in a few lines it is harder still to suggest the characteristics of william 7ordan 7unior judged by the standard of the souls grand effort towards perfection henry northcote the advocate fails and william jordan junior the poet succeeds despite imprisonment poverty sickness and ridicule air snaith is perhaps the only writer of prose who has understood the poetic character his prose in its faults and merits is a poets prose throughout and the character of his poet must be founded on some mighty experience the frail boy is brought up by his aged father in a little bookshop he lives with the heroes of the iliad in a world of poetry and dreams he is terrified of the  streetpeople and as unfit for school or business as a fairy yet gifted with dauntless resolution he lives down his terrors one by one and does not die till he has written the poem it was his mission on earth to write there is nothing in literature like this story of a sublime spirit imprisoned in a wasting frame even the humour is unique who can ever forget the conversation of mr octavius crumpett the publisher with queen victorias favourite novelist  the novelist is in distress he has been offered a title mr crumpett tells him that he should accept it for the honour of literature the great author acquiesces with a sigh he says he can hardly imagine sir william shakespeare and no friendship in literature is more truly pathetic and charming than that of the poet ith the young matthew arnold dodsonan episode which keeps the story human and relieves the mad and stifling tragedy of its close in these days those who would proclaim  one genius more  can hardly hope for a hearing however just their arguments or good their cause we have no desire to be extravagant in our laudation of mr snaith he has given us only three books that are literature and only one masterpiecewilliam 7ordan 7unior but that work is unique and it is a masterpiece and it is all but unknown,war

proportionately diminished  nd however great may be the talents of the author however original the bent of his genius his highest triumph is usually bounded by a single hit the very element of success excessive stimulation is an element rapidly exhausted among the writers of this class the author of the work before us is prccmiucnt for his mirthmoving power for his acute sense of the ridiculous for the breadth of his humour and for his power of dramatic writing which renders his boldest conceptions with the happiest facility the truthfulness of his representations of thc features of a state of society in ireland scarcely yet gone by and his intimate acquaintance with the very forms of thought habitual toonepon tion of the irish population have been rarji equalled in his delineations of lifo

for a hearty and a prolong laugh and in which the raciness of the fun met often amounts to wit yet in the very excess this excellence we discover the source rf weariness and long before we had arrived

preserve their hold on the attention of the reader this fault is the more to be lamented in the present instance because it is derived from no want of power in the author in his portrait of the family

the great proconsul edited by sydney c grier blackwood  sons though the great proconsul is not a book of so much fancy or interest as  in furthest ind and like another helen or some other historical novels of the same author it would be absurd to rank it with common novels in in furthest ind we had a stirring story of the fortunes and misfortunes which befell an englishman during the early days when the trading establishments scattered along the coast were laying the foundation of british dominion in india the narrative of edward carlyon late of the honourable east india companys service gentleman and comprising his most marvellous escape from the hands of the inquisition falsely called holy at goa and his journey to the court of the great moghul was full of life variety and colour the materials were real but they had passed through the crucible of the imagination edward carlyon was a hero with flesh and bones and therefore he lives in our memory in  like another helen the author chose a romantic period in the history of our indian empire and the story of the siege of calcutta well told from original documents gave it dramatic interest sylvia irene who related her adventures in a series of letters was a bright and felicitous creation in the great proconsul the narrative is presented in the form of memoirs by mrs hester ward a friend and dependent in the family of the governorgeneral but she is not a creation merely a portrait of a respectable female of her time while her sentimental rhapsodies become somewhat tedious and her love story is not very interesting maxwell her lover we are prepared to like and respect but it is impossible to have any wild enthusiasm for him the following cannot by any stretch of imagination be regarded as an exciting love scene   if omnipotence preserve me you ll find me awaiting you still i assured him and he raised my hand again to his lips in silence what a mournful pleasure do i now discover in tracing afresh every word and incident of that evening  as though i could transfer to though cold and voiceless paper the clasp of my maxwells fingers the music of his tones  beloved youth how noble is thy spirit which with uncomplaining fortitude endured a separation uch as it almost drew thy tears only to contemplate  how long we sat band in hand in a sympathetic and not unhappy silence i dont know but we were disturbed by the blaze of lights and the noise of the servants which announced the return of our patrons and their ii oats in  the great proconsul the historical material has not been sufficiently idealised for fiction and the amount of it interferes with the story and shackles the romance we have an account of the revolt at henares the mahratta war the carnatic war and the dissensions in council the revolt at benares the retreat from talekaon baillies disaster would each of them supply background for an historical romance lut when you attempt to deal with all of them the canvas has too large a background either for artistic effect or for he common readers interest sydney grier has here followed the example of scott in conuectidg a love story with the fortunes f a great historical character warren hastings however is a difficult personage to bring prominently forward in u work of fiction but the task has been performed with considerable skill and he etands out lofty brave and unselfish touched with a sacred fear of the excellence of the woman he loved his letters to his wife most fully reveal the character of the man and those who have read them as the present writer first did some thirty years ago in the british museum or the selection of them in that most delightful book echoes from old calcutta will recognise how closely the lines of this selfrevelation have been followed by sydney grier it would have been more effective to include some of them instead of mrs hester wards opinion of them she tells us that hastings after his escape from benares wrote three billets all very brief from chunar to his wife they all breathe the same spirit of unqualified cheerfulness displaying not the least anxiety in the world for the writers own safety but much for that of mrs hastings whom he desires repeatedly to return at once to boglepore or even to calcutta so as to be out of danger hastings wrote to his wife  i am at chunar and in perfect health i entreat you to return to calcutta be confident my beloved all is now well and will be better i have no fears but for you the character of the  adored marion  is marvellously well drawn she stands before us fond of pomp dress and diamonds but with an imperious will and a passion capable of bewitching the soul of hastings her sole aim was that he shall have every day a several greeting though german was her natural language she spoke english correctly and elegantly but with a foreign accent it is we think a perilous business if not an artistic blunder to attempt to reproduce the foreign accent  de victory is won now and more dan half de cost saved i will be responsible for de future does not delight nor does it necessarily convey the accent of one whom philip francis considered  really an accomplished woman the b ok has its faults but it has also the great merit of giving a living picture of the manners and characters of a past age we have them before usgenerals

malicious francis and  curricle  barwell who a letter of the period states encouraged francis to play for high stakes in order to get him into his power but francis won he wrote to mr godfrey  you must know my friend that on one blessed day of the present year of our lord 1770 i had won about 20000 at whist it is reduced to about 12000 and i now never play but for trifles and that only once a week to win a big sum bank it and then play for trifles is characteristic of philip francis but there was a generous side to his nature your allowance to me is noble wrote the faithful wife and if he

was born by the governor the chief justice mr justice chambers mr francis mr farrer the councillor six ladles bore it from the gate of the buryingground to the grave sydney grier embodies this incident in the story and it is an example of the fidelity with which she has described and illustrated the manners and habits of the time one must be a student of history to estimate the book fairly and one must have dwelled in india to appreciate the freshness fidelity and glow of colour of the eastern descriptions  the great proconsul by sidney c grier 6s blackwood the prefatory note of warning to the ordinary novel reader that you are earnestly recommended to shut this book and pass on as it will not interest you and so forth is a mistake it savours of an affectation of superiority towards her public that the novelist would do well for the sake of her own dignity to avoid it is better every way to leave even the most ordinary novel reader to judge for himself what suits his taste instead of assuming that his mental capacity must needs be less than the authors certainly  the great proconsul  is as the author announces in that warning note long and dull but that in itself is no justification for its being soit ought not to be either a little pruning a little condensation of occasionally verbose and relatively unimportant passages would have fitted the book for the ordinary as well as for the extraordinary novel reader for certainly the career of warren hastings is no matter for dulness from his own writings and those of his friends and enemies miss grier has drawn an intimate and sympathetic view of his character and she reveals it and tells the story of his troubled and broken career by means of a diary kept by an imaginary lmrs ward who lived and went through some startling adventures in india and was befriended by hastings and his wife it is cleverly written and in parts profoundly interesting it required only some effective omissions and curtailments to have made it wholly so and to have secured for it that popular success that is not always so despicable as it seems,war
other ranks by wv v tilsley with an introduction by edmund blunden 7s 6d cobdensanderson on receipt of yet a further book on the great war at first you may exclaim lightly  what another   on second thoughts you may recollect that the experiences ot 1914 to i9i8 were in all conscience sufficient to inspire an untold number of men and women into genuine selfexpression and there always is place for literary work written in such circumstances inspiration and sincerity should suffice to justify any essay into the realms of print mr tilsley possesses both but his book has a great deal more than that in it first of all it is worth a whole library of war novels since though equally uninterrupted in time and sequence it contains no character less actual than the incidents narrated this is excellent as nothing is more irritating than the jumble of truth and fiction too frequently to be discovered in so called war books the outstanding merit however of this chronicle of the daily life of private soldiers in the trenches in action and at the base is the dispassionate mood in which every line of it is penned here is a vigorous narrative depicting all the horror the beastliness and the frightfulness of the wvar yet not for a single instance does it degenerate into undignified or embittered vituperation it is one of the most convincing records of the war because though full of imaginative vigour it is written with admirable restraint,war
the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,war

adventures in servia  or the experiences of a medical free lance among the bashibatouhs fr by dr alfred wright edited by a g farquharbernard mrcs late surgeon of the servian army sonnenschein  co the supposed author is evidently an imaginary person the real hero of the adventures being mr farquharbernard the book is confessedly a sort of historical novel but in the preface we are assured that  at least three out of every four of the incidents herein narrated really took place and that to the fourth only such proportion of romantic dressing and spicery has been added as would enable it to harmonise with the rest moreover i am desired to state that every character depicted in these pages had its living prototype one great advantage of this imitation of defoes system is that it enables the author to express his opinions of the people whom he seeks to describe very freely without wounding the susceptibilities of individuals the imaginary dr wright a medical student in july 1876 when the struggle between the servians and turks was at its height agreed with another medical student henry winter nicknamed by his comrades hiems to go to servia with the double view of making themselves useful and of gaining professional experience taking with them a supply of medical comforts and surgical appliances the two friends arrived at belgrade and were engaged as assistant surgeons at two pounds a week and board and lodging posted first to the hospital at semendria their short stay there was rendered pleasant by a little lovemaking sent to belgrade in charge of a steamerload of wounded the author after completion of his duty went to the hotel patronised by the russian officers who flocked to offer their services to servia most of them were gentlemanlike and friendly but there were exceptions at belgrade he was witness of a scandalous scene of which a col bragg an adventurer commanding a regiment of servian cavalry was the nero here we may be allowed to remark how extraordinary it is that in the case of a war like that between turkey and servia disreputable englishmen without courage conduct or experience should so frequently be engaged by the combatants when there are many good and selfrespecting retired english officers only too ready to accept commissions to return to our textprincess natalie lying seriously ill an edict was issued forbidding people either to ride or drive past the palace the inhabitants of belgrade were particular in obeying the order and were wont when passing the palace to speak in whispers and walk on tiptoe   suddenly the silence was broken by the clattering of a horses hoofs and the yelping of a cur who should appear upon the scene mounted upon a large chestnut horse but col brag  he sat his horse pretty well but from his fiery complexion and the way he swore sk the dog which bayed furiously at his horses heels i fancy he must have been intoxicated that at least is a charitable supposition the cur yelped and snapped at the horse making it rear and plunge in a way that threatened to un seat the gallant colonel who livid with rage cursed until he was hoarse for fully five minutes a frightful war of sounds continued the dog growling and barking the colonel roaring and swearing and the horse kicking and striking sparks from the rough pavement with his hoofs suddenly the terrible brag changed his tactics and drawing his sabre made a vigour ous down cut at the dog the blow was well aimed the dogs head rolled on the stones then sheathing his weapon the colonel trotted along twirling his moustache with an air of triumphant ferocity on his truculent face undeterred however by the awful fate of the cur a presumptuous gendarme took upon himself the enforcement of the edict in the colonels case and fearlessly confronting him forbade him to ride further in that direction  get out of my way youidiot whats the matter with you  said the colonel contemptuously putting on a tremendous expression and endeavouring to spur his horse past the bold gendarme the  bold gendarme however laid hold of the bridle  will you take your hand off my bridle v shouted the colonel the gendarme stood firm whereupon uttering one of his choicest oaths the colonel struck him on the face and making his horse rear at the same time succeeded in shaking him off then invoking a lot of the most bizcme and recherch maledictions i ever heard on his discomfited adversary the twice triumphant brag rode off  do english officers usually behave like that  asked mouravioff sarcastically  never replied i indignantly  they are gentlemen as for this col bragg i believe he is an american adventurer i am quite certain he is not an english officer sent to the front dr wright found himself owing to an unfortunate grudge born against him by one of the principal surgeons obliged to exchange his position of assistant surgeon for that of lieutenant in the eussian brigade so called because of the nationality of most of the officers being full of fight he was delighted at the circumstance and found the russians excellent comrades the men were however a set of awkward louts taken fresh from the desk and plough and by no means quick in picking up even the most elementary drill tired of inactivity dr wright and two of his eussian comrades spent out of a spirit of bravado a night in a cottage in a wood close to the turkish outposts and after a sharp skirmish in the morning with difficulty gained the servian lines the story of this adventure is told in a spirited fashion the following eassage illustrates the discipline applied j the russian officers to their servian soldiers savrimovitch mouravioff and i were silently smoking under the shelter of our hut when a bullet whistled between us and passed out through the leafy wall behind we btarted to our feet and rushed outside a number of soldiers were standing or sitting about engaged in cleaning their rifles cooking c mouravioff demanded furiously who had fired the shot a heavy btupidlooking fellow was pointed out as the culprit whereupon our friend strode up to him and seizing him by the collar asked him sternly what he meant by discharging a loaded rifle in camp the soldier sulkily answered that he had only fired his piece in the air and did not know there waa any harm in that whereupon the roughandready mouravioff replied  idiot dont you know that when you send a bullet into the air it is likely to come down again like this  and striking him on the head with his clenched fist knocked him over this severe treatment caused some murmuring amongst the soldiers who were already beginning to tyre ofrussian discipline a sinister rumour that many russian officers had been treacherously slain in battle by some of their own men whose illwill they had incurred was current in camp and it was undoubtedly true that russian officers frequently treated the servians with great harshness but considering though rawness and inaptitude of the material they had to deal with and the absolute necessity of enforcing discipline i do not think that the kicks and cuffs i often saw them bestow on their men were unmerited again although the unwarlike serbs murmured at being dragooned into discipline they seemed very soon to regain their equanimity they are naturally too goodnatured and easygoing a race to be vindictive and therefore i believe that the heavy losses among the russians were due to their reckless valour and not to servian treachery nevertheless many russians i met firmly believed this rumour in spite of the indignant denial of it given by the servians,war

noblesse oblige novels and novelettes by sarah tytler 3 vols hurst  blackett vestinays martyrdom a story of the catacombs by emma raymond pitman hodder  stoughton the spanish barber by the author of mary powell nisbet  co perhaps the latest production of miss tytler an author not without experience might have been fraught with more interest to the general reader if the necessities of custom had not required that the matter of half a volume should be spread out into three taking the most favourable view of noblesse oblige the best friends of its author could scarcely venture to say that it offers anything of engrossing interest either in the characters or in the story yet there are glimpses here and there of humour and intention especially where the author does not attempt too high a flight in the social scale which might have formed as it were the cadre of a good story before the sevenfold process of dilution was applied small countrytown scenes and society might have afforded a good deal of amusement at least we should imagine so from the description of the misses medlar the twicefour blooming daughters of the  first attorney in wellfield  the low and vulgar wellfield wags we are told multiplied the number of the miss medlars to forty the forty miss medlars j then by a natural and wicked association they had changed the miss medlars into thieves the forty thieves innocent though they were of stealing mens hearts they were tall stout passably goodlooking girls their bane was plethora in constitution as well as number few men could serenely contemplate a wife of eleven stone weight any more than thirtynine sistersinlaw happy had it been if miss tytler had traced out the lives of these smalltown beauties instead of giving way to that alluring form of ambition which forces a certain class of novelists in spite of nature and in defiance of art to draw highlife groups for which assuredly they have never had any proper models what can we expect when we find colloquial phrases not used in the upper classes or in any educated class cropping up to the surface continually in certain parts of the book lord wriothesleys illness had seemed nothing out of the common she seems to be learning to live without rest or refreshment of any kind for as small and frail as she is  once they had arrived and got a cup of tea she would be able to chat with phoebe  she felt a vast deal better already and able for any amount of gossip i am glad i have got anything i wanted and am the better of we take these singular specimens of english as we find them here and there and we have only to observe that they are not placed in the mouths of persons supposed to be uneducated or even of the misses medlar but that they proceed either directly from the author or from the more refined personages of the story including the countess of exmoor and her daughter the lady dorothea latimer it is wonderful how the author identifies herself with the great latimers and how she despises the small latimers otherwise  the essex latimers who will succeed to the title in consequence of the death of lady dorotheas brother lord wriothesley yet these despised latimers are kind enough to give a home to lady dorothea who conde scends while utterly despising them and calling them commonplace goodish sort of people to avail herself of the accommodation of their house for the purposes of her wedding the difference between the present earls family and the relatives who are to succeed him and who are of course of the same aristocratic stock is surely a difference twixt tweedledum and tweedledee but the author revels in such a difference and so far from exhibiting it as a personal prejudice in the mouth of one of her characters makes herself a party to it in the most uncompromising and glaring manner in short miss tytler is an oligarch to the backbone except in one particular point and there nature creeps out the two heroines of the story lady dorothea and miss phoebe pas ton are both wooed by men of rank yet they both condescend to marry men of far inferior positions thus the independence of the sex is vindicated and the authors female conscience is saved it will be better for her readers and herself if in future works she makes her matter in some degree commensurate with her space and abstains from the attempt to describe phases of society with which her acquaintance is evidently imperfect passing to the second work on the above list we come to a tale of other times but one which is also of serious earnest quality as almost all visitors to rome have joined a party to see the catacombs and have made their way through the narrow passages lined with the empty restingplaces of early christians pausing now to observe a phial of blood now some ancient device on the wall it is likely that the present story will revive many interesting associations miss pitman promises to introduce us to the life of that roman community which was addressed in an epistle and was visited by st paul and which dragged out a troubled and anxious existence under the shadow of the emperor nero vestina who gives her name to the story is a noble roman maiden aud a convert to christianity at first she keeps her religious change a secret but after a time her mother and her brother follow her example and they are martyred before her but there are other and much more important characters in the story miss pitman tells us at the end that many of the incidents here recorded are historical facts and could have been presented in a series of historical chapters but to many minds the thin disguise of fiction is more attractive and to many more the dry historical account seems repulsive while they will welcome the same information in this form it is for this reason no doubt that st paul himself is brought on the stage and that we are shown the apostle during his first visit to rome arguing with the jews and preaching to christians in the hired house where he was suffered to dwell with the soldier who had charge of him several names mentioned in st pauls epistles occur also in the story onesimus demas alexander the coppersmith take a prominent part on the whole miss pitmans work is a fair sample of the religious historical story there is a certain superficial verisimilitude in the use made of the smallest biblical hints and in the working out of characters whose names and leading peculiarities alone are mentioned by the apostle miss pitman enters sometimes into the spirit of her story and the description of  vestinas martyrdom or rather of her timely release from martyrdom is simple and touching when we are told however that the facts presented to us might have occupied a series of historical chapters we feel bound to point out the abundance of grave errors in the historical parts of the story miss pitman has apparently taken her dates from the margin of her bible and seeing there that st paul arrived in rome ad 63 and that the epistle to philemon was written a year later she has not scrupled to bring in the story of onesimus the slave and to describe his being sent back to his master even with these materials before her she has made a mistake for in this epistle st paul speaks of demas as his fellowlabourer while according to miss pitman demas had already forsaken the apostle but the other facts which have to tally with these dates are still more unfortunately chosen we read that in ad 63 vespasian had defeated the jews vespasian was not sent against them till the year 66 nero is represented in the same year as accompanied by his young wife octavia he had put her away the year before and had married poppaja a few days afterwards the late attempt to rehabilitate nero seems to have led miss pitman to state that he set the city on fire to satisfy a brutal jest  as is now universally believed from corroborative testimony the peculiar felicity of the word  now  appears most strongly when we remember that modern criticism has shaken what ancient historians believed but if in this case ancient opinions are attributed to the moderns modern words are in return ascribed to the ancients miss pitman talks incomprehensibly of the  bagnio or public way to what language does she think that word belongs  yet even this is outdone by the statement that the part of rome lying beyond the tiber was called in ad 63 the trastevere what possible sense that name could have till the river itself had become the italian tevere instead of the latin tiber or tiberinus we must leave to miss pitman to discover when she says too that  to dwell in the trastevere was to be accounted among the scum and offscouring of the inhabitants we cannot but feel for the good name of that friend of horaces who lived far across tiber near caesars gardens after these specimens of miss pitmans mistakes we need hardly add that the laliclavu8 or broad stripe was not worn on the toga or upper garment but on the tunica or under garment that pan was a greek deity and not  the god of the country among the romans and that the lupercalia were not festivities in his honour but were offered to the god of fertility accuracy on these points is a minor consideration though it was hardly necessary for miss pitman to enter into details which she could not verify her other blunders are much more serious and affect the value of her book we abandon neither serious purpose nor grave mistakes when we come to the third of the above works in punch for the year 1844 will be found one of those humorous paragraphs illustrated with quaint woodcuts by thackeray and called forth by a statement in the times of the day to the effect that some british society had hit upon a novel plan of introducing tracts into spain viz by bottling them securely corked these same bottles were cast adrift at the entrance of the bay of cadiz and being washed on shore by the tide found their way landwards through the medium of the sailors  so no doubt  reported the agents of the parent society thackerays humorous paper is in the form of a remonstrance addressed to espartero then an exile in england there are three illustrations no 1 depicts a sailor waistdeep in the sea clutching a bottle floating towards him on the crest of a wave  rum praps exclaims the excited salt no 2 the same sailor on shore a fellow salt and a boy personating audience he is in the act of inserting the screw into the cork and exclaims  sherry i hope no 3 in withdrawing the cork he finds some paper adhering and with disappointment dismay and contempt depicted on his countenance exclaims  tracts by jingo the title of this book the spanish barber by the author of  mary powell suggested  rum praps and a perusal of the table of contents and the first chapter led to sherry i hope this chapter has much of the power of this quaint and original writer but a further perusal induced disappointment and the exclamation of tracts by jingo involuntarily escaped our lips miss mannings story is evidently written for the purpose of what is termed in the exeter hall vernacular  doing the good work a certain lay figure is set for the converted sinner who goes on converting other sinners in a style of simple addition quite delightful to contemplate given a spanish barber locality gibraltar who shaves a lay figure named caravantes probably so called because the barber quotes cervantes and boasts that he knows the adventures of the knight of la mancha by heart proverbs and all the shavee converts the shaver at once the shaver his wife they quote texts and the shaver decides to close his shop on sunday this naturally curtails his trade but he pursues the  good work leaving his wife in the charge of and to be maintained by her parents he crosses to oran as a colporteur laden with a sack of tracts he lends a shivering jew his cloak who returns it by the hands of his son a delicate youth consumptive of course this young jew is converted his father smothers himself with dust curses the barber and dies a  contrabandist is introduced who uses very coarse language and cuts the throats of his fellow creatures without the slightest compunction he repents conveniently and ever after trades honestly paying all importduties in a very  goodygoody manner indeed no englishman worthy the name he bears will speak slightingly or contemptuously of true religion nor of those who seek to carry the godly precept of loving ones neighbour as oneself into daily practice but goodygoody stories like the present serve no purpose worthy the name of purpose  and such a pen as that which traced mary powell should leave such  good work  to smallbeer chroniclers of the  moral pockethandkerchief school by the way the equivalent to barbers

nation of snobs whose pitiful abject snobbishness is far more deeply ingrained than anything that theray for mere fus ske described  or must we say that the picture is morbidly unnatural and that an intelligent and clever woman who has written some good literature has made a blunder and overreached herself in aiming at strong artistic effect  the latter alternative is the less humiliating of the twor but in place ol electing to sa by it we shall endeavour to present the teader with such characteristics of the boob as may enable him to judge whether miss tytleri char is pr or not proven the body of this book we maintain is in elf a charge against the english nation and if miss tyer were a red republican working under flse colours he could not have written anything more damaging to the principles and fielings which she a ntly advocates i noblesse oblige is lhe story of an earls son who falls in love with an artists daughter the brockootes family seem to have a notion that the leaders of englih politics must necessarily spring from the old tic families and young lord wriothesley is the coming hero he is to gain for the exmoors the glory of great reputation and his sister lady dorothea is to strengthen the family by a rich match lord wriothesley is rather infirm of purpose for instead of passing reform bills and organising emigration schemes he falls in love in a sort of helpless fashion with phoebe paston the artists daughter lady dorothea on the other hand knows her duty and performs it she is about to may a lord fairchester whom she does not particularly love then she gets to love him very much then it turns out that there is a mistake in the title atid then the young woman who is represented as a miracle of goodness aned kindness and honor turns him off  if lord fairchester is reduced to john blount she observes tranquilly to phxebe he will be no match for dorothea latimer owe exmoors have always sacrificed our private feelings and had not to do with mwial1iianvx when she parts with her lover she informs him that their two souls are united for ever which means we presume that her delicate sense of honour will not prevent her marrying her body to somebody else meanwhile lord wriothesley dangles after the artists daughter much to the discomfort of her other lover an artist whose only comfort is that wriothesley is a good young man and means no harm he had no doubt thwt lard wriothesley was of such a set whitewashed and vituos os became a latimer but man enough to have his iudividual tastes although peer enough to hanker after forbidden fruit lord wriothesley could not have phoebe paston mny more than the prince of wales could have had her but he could admire her court her and dangle after her in a dilettante virtuous iatimer fasbion only robbing her of her virgin fancy her maiden meditations the first bloom of her heart phoebe is a curious young woman who has occasional fits of satllennew and frequent fits of loquacity strangely enough she has a horror of reviewers and rates them so sudly that in selfhumiliation we cannot forbear to quote her speeches it must be said however that phoebe has just been paid a visit by her

of this kind frank hall appears to have been introduced for the purpose of owing miss tytlers contempt for reviewers in general and we presume it is with a subtle sarcasm that she represents his preferring the wines at the gartick club to those of lord exmoor phoebes father is an artist of great reputation who looks upon himself as a sort of vassal or serf of the exmoor family the other characters are unhmportant now it would seem that the great occupation in life of these people is to talk of the differences of class indeed the word  class  crops up in these  pages until we get heartily sick of it two women almost strangers meet hurriedly in the street they have not seen each other for some time and the one asks the other how she likes the place phoebe replies that she has every reason to speak well of the people whereupon mrs edgecumbe immediately points out that such people are necessarily unknown to her  you see i have known my class these thousand years and the other is not at all in my way poor phoebe she is beset on all sides by  class  and it is an open question whether one ought to be more ashanied of the despicable titleworship on the part of her neighbours or more disgusted with the profound selfconsciousness of rank on the part of her grand friends lord exmoors family talk as if they had just acquired their patent of no bty and were overcome by the new sensation even the mild and characterless lord wriothesley when he visits phoebes father has to beg that there will be no fuss made about him and hopes that paston will not turn courtier but the oddest exhilbitions of this feeling occur in its reflex action upon the people around phoebe is writing to lady dorothea and she says is it not the boast of the ermoora that they have once and again at such seasons jeopardied lands and life for king and country  may not we follow at a distance and hazard in our turn our small private fortunes for the credit of our friends and our class is there no noblesse oblige in the middle rank and the mercantile world also p forgive me for likening myself to you lady dorothea but i wish you could see my uncle now he sets himself to breast the blast and begin life anew with my aunt standing by and fairly for etting that she used to take a great deal out of him and demand special consideration from him for being a wingfield of batty and wingfield a norman mercantile house in these parts lady dorothea now more eagerly deferential to him than i could have imagined a woman a little hard and exacting in her better days could under any circumstances become  a norman mercantile house  is excellent elsewhere phoebe remarks of her titled friends  they are great people and as such perfectly exceptional no more to be measured by small people in their actions and the consequences of their actions than kings are to be measured it was probably owing to her deference to this divine right of great people that phoebe although she loved barty wooler and was by him beloved invariably snubbed him in order to remain single and let lord wriothesley flirt with her indeed she looks forward to the certainty of his proposing to her and she allows her neighbours to talk of the match as settled without taking any particular thought as to what she must do should he be so indiscreet phoebe has a great liking for lord wriothesley but then she is of opinion that  love and love alone can cross securely the chasm between clas and class and so she allows matters to drift apparently hoping that lord wriothesley would marry her and yet not removing barty wooler too far out of reach finally lord wriothesley dies and then she falls back upon barty and marries him she admits that she might have married lord wriothesley  out of pure gratitude loyalty and reverence but that her heart was b alty s the time we hope barty liked the position dy dorotheas affairs end in a marriage also for she at last resolves to recall the dicared mr blount but then she has resolved likewise to go to canada so that her degrdation in marrying a man without a title w be so far hkidde she  spoke mls of w i u a ct to be dose in a corner and out  the

the continental dragoon  a love story of philipse manor house in 1778 by robert neilson stephens ward lock  co we have lately had so many romances by american writers which dealt with french history that it is refreshing to come upon one the author of which has been content to find materials in the history of his own country mr stephens has based his story upon the actualities out of which grew the united states of america and has woven a pretty romance out of simple materials the philipse manor house was situate on the  neutral ground  which lay between the circle of kings troops about new york and the arc of the american forces opposed to them caprice takes a lovely young woman from new york to this place and circumstance sends there a  rebel captain who ends by winning the love of his captor the whole action takes place in a week but it is a week notable for many exciting adventures crisply described the story reads like a drama made into a novel and if it be not such then it might well be dramatized the one serious fault is the lengthy and somewhat heavy manner in which the author works up to the real action the matter of the first fifty pages might have been indicated in five and the readers pleasure enhanced at the expense of his knowledge of american history,war

  my lady rotha by stanley weyman a d innes mr weymans constant production does him no harm evidently indeed he is assuring for himself a high place among english storytellers the matter out of which he weaves his romances is never thin if he does not use such a wasteful amount as dumas he always strikes one as having enough and as having got it from good sources and his presentment of it grows with each story more skilful more literary my lady rotha is an admirable bit of storytelling in as far as manner goes so admirable that one is ready to forgive a certain looseness in the plot it is doubtful if mr weyman have yet chosen or found his field at the present moment he is very cleverly combining two kinds of storytelling which at first sight are nearly irreconcileable his tales are of the belt and spur order of camps and rough rides and hairbreadth adventures and the motives and effects of the actions are purely conventionalvirtue is rewarded vice is punished brave heart wins fair lady and so on yet they contain studies of character sometimes ambitious ones where though the main lines are drawn according to a conventional pattern the details are strongly individual which side will be ultimately developed whether he will write mainly for the young or for older folk it is at this point impossible to say in tmy lady rotha he has done a daring thing for he has gifted his heroine in many ways a charming person with an unmistakably bad temper,war
  fiction king noanett by f j stimson john lane success does not often crown the effort of a man to weave a romance over the skeleton of anothers masterpiece failures at that task within recent years could be recalled but as the masterpieces were the subjects of parody not of emulation the cases need not be mentioned now however arrayed in the mantle of a great englishman an american writer walks into our presence without being either impertinent or ridiculous king noanett by mr f j stimson is not inferior to the bewitching lorna doone that is all the more remarkable because in its main outlines and in its way with words it is almost identical with mr blackmores work like john ridd bampfylde moore carew is a young man of humble station roaming over the devonshire moorlands like lorna doone miss st aubyn is a maid of high degree who casually meets the hero in the romantic solitudes as in mr blackmores tale love arises betwixt these twain despite a bitter feud between the classes to which their families belong though maids family is for the king the young mans is for the commonwealth their stolen interviews in the earlier chapters are no less sweetly told than is the timid dalliance of john ridd and the immortally charming daughter of the doones the lovers are separated of course and then mr stimson makes a slight digression john ridd ranged himself against the doones and fought with fury  moore carew promptly sheds his antimonarchical puritanism and draws his sword in support of the royalists he has not only our sympathy but our admiration also on account of that apostacy it is not in any creditable human nature to remain a roundhead with a miss st aubyn to inspire us otherwise the proper harmony of carews sentiments with the cause for which the ladys father was fighting did not affect the fortunes of the civil war returning from a meeting with her carew  heard a plaintive cadence of melody over the evening moor it was a mans voice but no roistering cavalier melody only just that sad and simple little tune to which the cause of the stuarts died  her whom ye love for him ye shall leave he is thy king if queen she shall ever be now ye may prove how both ye do love dying so loyally living so tenderly  that song although we are not told so at though time was warbled by one miles a young irishman whose acquaintance carew makes when both of them for treason against the commonwealth are voyaging in a convict ship to virginia with them on that unwilling errand is a maid little jennifer who becomes much attached to the irish royalist because of his thrashing some men on board who had illused her arrived in the community of pilgrim fathers to which they had been consigned the two exiles find it necessary to pass off little jennifer as miless wife and she has to share all their subsequent adventures in the same guise this complexity of affairs is managed with delicate skill the adventures themselves are thrilling in the extreme particularly so is the culminating crisis in which quite aftor the manner of john ridd in lorna doone miles and moore storm an indian fort who should they meet there but miss st aubyn  and by what were they attracted but by the strains of the jacobite song which miles himself had poured forth on the devonshire moorlands her father at a disadvantage with the kings enemies at home had gone to harass their sires and their uncles abroad and had become king noanett a chief of the red indians it turns out alas that although not with equal sanction the two royalist exiles had been buoyed up through all their years of trial by love of the same woman we do mr stimson an injustice in telling his tale thus as indeed we should do in telling it at all but we havo not told it wholly and the last is the greatest scene there are many romances in which one would fain here and there reconstruct a sentence or obliterate a chapter but there is not a word in king noanett which we should wish to change in its reticent ease its tenderness its cleanly strength the story is admirable,war

natural faculties requisite to tile corposition ot rmnance for it ie lad theme he would not have turned his attention first to the mfore formal writing but he would have addressed himself immediately to that which inclination as well as conscious capacity would have suggested ibut mr warburton has fairly deceived the anticipations which the experience of others had awakened on the announcement of a novel from his pen lie has proved himself as capable of romance as of history or travels reginald hastings is a nigher approach to scorrs marvellous creations than we have read for some years certainly since the first two or three of jai ess novels when his imagination was fresh and he had not taken to copy himself reginald i astings is a story of the civil wars it is in truth the history of prince rupert and the cavaliers wrought into a romance with the help of a few fictitious personages but with facts for its foundation and framework and its portraiturcs of personages and descriptions of manners of costumes and other accessories faithfully drawn from the reminiscences of the times as they had been presented to the author in the course of his historical researches with another object and here too we discover that distinctness of description that liveliness of narrative that breadth of colour and glow of imagination which distinguished his crescent andithe crossl and made it one of the most popular books of our time ilis battle scenes are peculiarly exciting for he brings them before us not as do inferior writers by an accumulation of epithets and a cloud of big words that convey no distinct image to the mind but by incidents by separate groups and the actions of individuals whence a mnuch more definite notion is formed of the whole than by an unpracticable attempt to represent as one image the entire hurlyburly of the field then tis dialogues are unusually dramatic smart and lively rarely falling into the vice of disquisition or the absurdity of soliloquy lie has also shown no snall ingenuity in his manner of introducing so many of the famous personages of the timle without the appearance of efwrt usually when this has been attempted as by horace smitii in branmbletye house fbr instance the eflort has been so manifest as to mar the effect of the whole plot incidentts have been manifostly invented where otherwise they would not have come for the express purpose of bringing some notability upon the stage who is often made to say a tow dull sentences that have no connexion with the business of the story and then lie departs and is no more seen in reginald ilastings they are really a portion of the story they do not come till they are called for and they play out their parts in it fairly mr1 warrirton can boast likewise a nice appreciation of character and considerable skill in its evolution in short he has all the elements for a successful novelist and only needs a little more practice to llace himsef among the foremost of his day in this as already he has done in two other branches of literature as reginald hasting will be in every circulating library and borrowed by all who ever read a novel we will not mar the anticipated pleasure of perusal by the slightest indication of the plot so ingeniously constructed and so ably evolved but we cannot even amid the many claims of the season upon our space resist makiig one 1cxtl act to exhibit the beauty of the style a battle scene my personal recollections of tlis battle are very vivid and to me memorable i have already mentioned that the skeleton of my troop was regimented with prince ruperts but his regiment waa itbelf become a skcletom three times he led us through a shattering fire of artillery against the city trainbands and as often were we flung backward from their palisades of pikes or perished under their fire more than one half of his brave aigiment fell before the sun was high after that finding it impossible to rally them again he rode away to the foot to endeavonr with them to retrieve the day but by that time the whole feed was in a general mneke as far as the cavalry were concerned the foot however stood firmly on either side exchanging hot musket fire as from so many fortifications while the horse fought each man where he could soonest find an enemy my yeomen indeed kept close to me and strove to apply their strength where it was most needed but with scarcely a dozen men i might almost as well have fought alone hotepur had been summoned to accompany the prince i had been left to rally what men i could and strange to say i felt quite lonely on that crowded field bryan had fallen wounded in the first charge my cornet had been slain by my side my yeomen were dispersed with their wearied and now useless horses and blount alone remained to me that faithful servant seemed to forget his own existence in watching over mine when i was struggling and trampling among fierce enemies there was he parrying the same weapon and almost dealing the same strokes when i had stopped to breathe my horse or been abandoned by the roundheads for some easier opponent there was blount too quiet and observant wiping his large moustache it might be with his wellworn gauntlet or arranging some strap about me that had been disordered it was during some such momentary pause that goring came sweeping by his horse all foam and maddened with many a wound but he himself calm and collected  ha loiterers  lie exclaimed with an unimpassioned but tremendous oath  is this a time for rest follow me as ye love honour and fear the irovomarshal i dashed forward and found myself among some fifty troopers that the general had collected along the field robinson the player rode beside me  great actor that le said pointing to goring as we gallopped along splendid hed be as joan of arc in petticoats by jove if ever i get home id astonish my old father with that look of his almost without a blow we cleared our way through the scattered masses of the enemy and gradually increased our little force as we bore down upan the point where gorings quick eye had perceived the kings standard sorely beset the royal guards stood bravely to their post but the roundhead artillery bad just begun to play upon them and a strong body of rebel horse was hovering near to dash in upon the gaps the iron shot should make we were halted for a minute or two to breathe our horses and heard gorings clear piercing voice mingling brave words of cheer with ruffian blasphemies  now sons of england he exclainmed charge home with me this once and dash like d on those cropeared knaves lie stooped to his chargers mane bounded across the artillerys line of fire and plunged into the opposite mass of roundhead horses as he did so did we all as if one man and found ourselves hand to hand with ilazleriggs own troopers in as fierce a melee as ever hand and heart gave strength to though taken by surprise they fought furiously gradually our dense formations struggled into wider space and separated into a hundred different and personal encounters just then my good steed fell crushing my right leg under him and blount was in a moment by my side before he could disengage me i heard a cry of agony from poor robinson his right hand had just been severed from his wrist and he held up his maimed arm to a gigantic trooper with a shrill prayer for quarter but that trooper was the stern harrison  cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord negligently he exclaimed as lie clove the poor players skull in two many such scenes wvere enacting round mebut through individual acts of valour terror and despair the spirit of conquest ruled for our side and resulted in the roundheads giving wiay then gorings trumpet sounded the recal and such of us as were able obeyed and retired within our lines goring did not give time to observe the fearful loss we had sustained with one word of commendation he led us on again horse and foot for half of ua had been unhorsed round the hill and so charged the artillery we mere too few to capture it but we made them retire from their guns and probably thus saved the day i know not what was doing elsewhere but at length we were left unassailed by the enemy and so rested on our arns men and horse alike incapable of further offensive movements i then had time to cast my eyes about me everywhero i beheld groups of dying men who had been withdrawn or withdrawn themselves out of the strife with which they were done for ever surgeons with their men with bared arms and bloody shirts were attending upon some ministers of religion were bending over others exercising their healing office upon the souls of the departing i drew near to one of the latter groups a noble form all sheathed in armour lay resting upon a pile of heather the face alone was bare and upturned to the sky and all seemed still with him except gushes of blood that bubbled up from the cuirass at every pulse beat so laid the beloved of many the admired of all the gallant good canarvon and kneeling by his side his white hair waving in the breeze was jeremy taylor the divine pouring forth such heavenly and consoling prayers as brightened up the countenance of the dying man with thoughts that conquered agony as we stood round our happy comrade lord jermyn the queens favourite rode up to him and hastily dismounted  ah my dear lord he exclaimed  this is sad work but we must get you round we never could afford to lose such an ornament to court and camp the courtier suddenly ceased for he saw that the angel of death was already there and even ho was awed in his solemn presence he was kindhearted too in his own way and lie bent over his friend and whispered softly  you have deserved well of the king have you no wish or prayer that i can deliver for you  the dying man without moving his eyes from a bright sunset spot among the clouds where they were fixed replied faintly and firmly  noi have no prayer but for the king of kings and with these grand words lie died i remained silently there beside him for some time and then rose sadly and slowly to seek among the wounded or perhaps slain my faithful follower bryan the battle was over the troops on either side were retiring and the trumpets on either side were sounding victory all fighting men had retired from the sanguinary and bootless field and there remained only some weary friends to seek and sonie savage suttlerwomen to spoil the dead thlen were found faulkland and sunderland and they were laid beside their friends as i have described then too was found many a slain father by his son a brother by his brother with heartbreaking grief that never found a voice except in the humble homes made desolate anl cries of pain anid half suppressed inoans of stout men in their agony rose up from the bloodmoistened grsss around me far and near and horses uttered hideous screams as they struggled to staled on broken limbs or gaspel for breath

harvest moon glimmered on many a battered breastplhte anul cloven helmet and broken sword redly too it shone reflected on many a pool of blood anri made dark shadows of the shapeless forms that were lately men and thus is glory won and thus after 16k years of christian grace do christians decide controversies concerning the common weal of their perishable bodies and immortal souls i leaned upon a broken guncarriage lost in contemplation of the scene before me and still as one of the surrounding dead i envied them the meanest trooper there looked sublime and happy in repose while the few forums that mioved along the woeful field seemed condemned to life haunting this penal world wearily one of these forms was now approaching slowly and stealthily a mist haid risen from the dewy field arid reudereui all shapos doubtfnl anrd undefined and ghostlike as the figure drew near however i could hear its breath drawn hard as if drawn through clenched teeth and as it turned towards the light i could see the glitter of the long knife or skene used by the camp followers my heart beat quick in spite of me as this illornened figure glided on now stopping over one body and cutting from it some article that seemed of value and now rolling aside another unconscious corpse in order to rifle it more conveniently i could by this time see that this creature was a womanone of those lost ones who haunted every camp corrupting the living and spoiling the dead bodies of the soldiery it was also asserted and i fear too truly that their murderous looking knives prevented many a wounded mans accusation horrid stories of such massacres rose up in my memory as i pursued the hyenalike woman with fascinated eyes she moved on rapidly and just before i lost sight of her my attention was

tunoriu rhodesia with thk sharpshooters by kennie stevenson the odd thing about south african war books is that although they are far too many each can plead if it does not bear in its very title a raison detre each has a public thus t  some readers the record of the long and lonesome marches of lord dunravens sharpshooters must of necessity be the most interesting book on the war yet published simply because it is concerned with themselves or their friends but even the general reader repleted as he is can turn without dismay to a book which tells its story in only 200 uncrowded pages mr stevensons aim is simply to describe thornside working of a squadron on the trek and a very amusing and touching story he makes of it the  last post sounds drearily over a comrades grave a kaffir sells a jug of beer and forgets to bring back the change out of a sovereign  camp humours canteen talk scares from hyenas and difficulties with wagons lend variety to the eternal programme described by a poetic trooper as  trekking trekking trekking always ballywell trekking from reveille until lights out our work is never done no troops we imagine have seen more of the wild and desolate life of the veldt jungles and forests of south africa than these sharpshooters one of mr stevensons most unnerving experiences was losing himself for several hours in the forest with monkeys jeering at him from the trees the sharpshooters ran all sorts of risks from wild animals sometimes a whole pack of hyenas and jackals would get on their track as many as fifty of these dangerous beasts following them mile by mile so that when a man wished to fall out three or four others remained to protect him scorpions tarantula and vermin afflicted the men in camp the task of drawing water at night from the nearest river or well was not a comfortable one in view of wildbeast amenities but the only lion with which our author actually tried conclusions he fired directly between its eyes turned out to be a pair of harmless glowworms some odd things happened one dark night when we were sitting around the fire a trader glided through the camp riding a white donkey we were all thunderstruck we thought there wasnt a white man near us for at least eighty miles one chap rather aptly expressed our feelings by crying out 4 here whats the name of that steamer   the trader never looked round but passed away into the night as mysteriously and softly as he came that story has a weird quality that we like  but indeed the whole book is a striking little record of such stern and fearless picnicing as britons love macqueen,war

a young philadelphia quaker turned soldier it begins with schooldays and ends in a glance backwards over happy married life and so far is conventional and commendable as the quakers say to the publio that has bought so many editions of lorna doone on the way there are good fighting good duelling and many perilous enterprises and fine scenes in old philadelphian mansions and imprisonment and fair women and brave men but there is more too there is a genuine flavour of the past the reader has glimpses of early pennsylvanian friends and the ample leisurely life they led and there are excellent portraits to add to his gallery aunt gainor the strongminded old whig gambler is a fulllength of much merit aunt gainor disliked quakers and hated tories hence she naturally took to her bed on hearing that a number of officers had been quartered in her mansion her nephew hugh sought to condole with her 441 assured my aunt that fortunately these were gentlemen but she was inconsolable declaring herself ill and that dr rush must come at once 4 but i said 4 he has gone with all the congress to york 4 then i shall die moaned my aunt at last knowing her well i said  is it not too sad   4 whats that what 4 mr howe has taken mrs pembertons carriage and the pair of sorrels for his own use at this my aunt gainors large face reappeared not as melancholic as before and i added 4 friend wain has six to care for and thomas scattergood has the hessian chaplain and a drunken major the rest of the friends are no better off 4 thank the lord for all his mercies  said miss wynne 4 and mr cadwaladers house on little dockstreet sir william bas 4 a pity that hugh the fine furniture will pay for it i fear i think hugh i am better or i shall be soon 4 they talk of the meeting over the way for a barrack aunt gainor now this was idly rumoured but how could one resist to feed an occasion so comic y 41 think i shall die contented said miss wynne the foregoing extract is proof enough to the experienced novelreader that aunt gainor win is a find the heroine darthea peniston is more elusive but she has continuous charm hugh was first drawn to her when at their first school darthea cried at the brutality shown him by the schoolmaster in the following passage where in after years hugh reminds her of this scene we have an example of the authors skill in dialogue hugh is riding lucy his mare and darthea sits behind him clinging to his waist having just been rescued from ad accident darthea speaks 44 4 you were very silent just now mr wynne a penny is what most folks thoughts are bid

the reader must seek the bcok where he will find plenty done excellently well with spirit and right feeling the foregoing quotations have been chosen principally to show that the fine graces are also within dr mitchells compass a story of adventure and prowess ringing with steel is not a very difficult feat especially at this moment but the author who can bring to the task not only enthusiasm for stirring deeds but also tenderness and delicacy a feeling for character and a wellbred style should be taken very warmly by the hand this dr mitchell does,war
the jesting army after perusing  the jesting army  no reader will need the authors assurance that the novel  was planned and sketched in outline long before the present fashion for war literature began and that  its writing has been quite unaffected by the controversies which that fashion has fathered mr ernest raymonds book bears the impress of spontaneity and sincerity on every page and his own attitude towards the war is certainly far enough removed from that of remarque and his followers to exonerate him from any possible charge of pandering to current taste for ourselves we prefer remarques attitude to mr raymonds but this is no place for debate however much readers may share or dislike mr raymonds view of the war they will be compelled to recognise that it is at all events a passionately honest one  the jesting army  is the second instalment of a trilogy begun last year by  a family that was  and to be completed by a novel of postwar england the present book describes tony ocrogans adventures during the war itself readers of  a family that was will remember tony as a youth of fine sensibility and potentiality but a little selfcentred wayward and dissatisfied his childhood in an anglican vicarage and his life at a day school had offered insufficient scope for his adventurous and artistic instincts to tony the nvar comes as a liberation not only does it give him an aim but while his reason argues against such a view he finds an aesthetic satisfaction in war he discourses at length to his comrades on this subject and that his attitude reflects mr raymonds own may be judged by the fact that one of tonys conversations is if we are not mistaken almost a verbatim reprint of an article which his creator published some time ago as representing his own ideas in the sunday times there mr raymond admitted that the romantic conception of war had its dangers but he frankly confessed that for himself he found an asthetic beauty in fighting tony then is the romantic public schoolboy who loves thrills more than he dreads danger and whose genuine patriotism is not unalloyed by the egotistical desire to win glory for himself he does distinguish himself at last at passchendaele but only after he has passed two years of comparative inactivity at gallipoli and in palestine there is an excellent plot which we cannot pause to follow and the development of tonys character in the crucible of his varied war experiences is a masterly and convincing study not less fine and subtle within certain limitations are the host of minor figures with whom mr raymonds canvas of four hundred and fifty closely printed pages are filled the author realises that tonys attitude was not t ii e universal one and the temperamental reactions of his fellow soldiers are as different as their ultimate fates some of the characters the jesting army by ernest raymond 7s 6d cassell mr ernt raymond such as the unconventional padre or tonys cockney batmanare so real and lovable that the disasters which befall them rend the readers heart if mr raymond sees the glamour of war he certainly does not spare us its horror and tragedy even though he seems to imply that the horror and tragedy are in some measure redeemed by the heroism and the selfsacrifice which they evoke as a novel  the jesting army  is extraordinarily good mr raymonds powers as a storywriter have here come to a fine maturity as a scenic background of the war moreover the book with its vast panorama of pictures of gallipoli palestine and france is second to none that we have read mr raymonds main limitation is that he is as much predisposed to see the best in human nature under adversity as other war novelists are to see the worst well differentiated as his characters are in other respects they are all much alike in their ability to jest in the face of death the jesting is remarkably good and lifelike and the patter and repartee of the lancashire privates is specially delightful and natural but we doubt if the british army was quite so uniformly a jesting army as mr raymond represents it no single writer can give us  the truth about the war of certain aspects of it at any rate mr raymond presents a very vital and for all the incidental gaiety a very poignant impression g t,war
sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think him soour grandchildren will do neither our utmost stretch of indulgence is to excuse the sailor because he was only a sailor sailing away as a boy and all his life from the charmed circle of insular prejudice learning life by living and foreign peoples in their own homes instead of in british parlours lecturerooms and missionary meetings admiral hobart like many another sailor of vigorous understanding unsophisticated conscience and limited culture failed to appreciate the timehonoured prejudice which should have forbidden him to respect in the infidel those very virtues dignity sobriety fortitude domesticity truth generosity and love of justicewhich he had been taught to revere as the peculiar appanage of his own countrymen in his eyes the swindling greek was no better than the corrupt pasha the savage baehi bazouk no worse than the cutthroat bulgarian and none of them half so bad as the atrocitymonger he may be at times superficial and inaccurate but that his main views

dickens is not so inhuman as to be absolutely faultless some suggest modifications and point out how they would have planned it if it had been theirs to write some are in raptures over one part some over another and some very particular fellows are carping at every part the judgments on lileah house are in short as various as judgments are apt to be upon a man whoso failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him and his books are bought and read by everybody that this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of

childrens children mr dickens has a large public in the present and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future the world will grow wiser than it is the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappearbut the spirit in which he writes and to which he appeals is indestructible  and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah house has relation to its plot the conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole und to interfere with though steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue but let us in the present instance with no less justice remark that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole the studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah house is very manifest event leads to event and chance words or though deeds of chance people that seem perfectly irrelevant are seen everywhere precisely as in real life exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death of happiness or misery to men and women perfectly unknown to them taking the mere surface view of such treat ment it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connexion and design and to display in the j attempt only our own very real want of sagacity this subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents is in fact truer to nature infinitely truer than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world its drawback is that it compels the uso tf a huge number of characters which come and go during though progress of the story  und j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journeys end over the  ground he has traversed they may now and then cause some j confusion in the readers mind mid produce an etlect like j that of an overcrowded picture 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault  he this as it may never in any former work

the chain of little things that lead indirectly to though catastrophe of lady dedlocks death so dexterously indeed an the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah house that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them as a mere cloud of isolated incidents a novel j may havo its too superficial readers as life has its too hasty obsorvers at though closo of his preface mr dickens marks

towards which the other sections of though tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge taking the story piecemeal as a mero gallery of pictures and persons we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah house finer than anything that even mr dickens has yet produced in the same way exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former

gathered from the pages of the book before us in though trooper george though ragnets and their humble household we have another of those fine broad hearty exemplifications of humour in which mr dickens delights in which all though ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all nothing is repulsive  everything is large laughable and true and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness the character of esiher summerson has been much elaborated and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything mr dickens has ever writtenindeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it full as it is of noble fancies and delicate and graceful thoughts but wo suspect that mr dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities we cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone which if not selfconsciousness is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of though character depicted yet the graces and virtues of esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them  and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues mrs jelly by and her despondent husband her daughter caddy and

mr dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted mr dickenss characters as all the world knows pass their names into our language and become types lt is  an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature to personify some main idea which are ever after found universally applicable such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since though beginning of all literature they know little how much there is in any ono mans head or heart who expect to have every i character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological  dissecting table and demonstrated minutely we see nobody minutely in real life the rough estimates we form of character aro on though whole if we possess any tact correct  but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes and it is the prominences the sharp i angles that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling hence it is therefore as well as for i other reasons that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters

way of revelation there have been many occasions when reading a novel we have been aware of the author at his work constructing plot evading difficulties carefully drawing his story to its conclusion there have been fewer occasions when the story has moved like some fine natural process gravely and steadily irresistibly towards its inevitable end the author being a mere accessorya needful recording medium not for many moons and many novels have we received this latter impression so strongly as when reading  way of revelation it is a big thing a novel of note among the published thousands of ordinary interest it holds a strange reserve of power and tragic emotion its observation and penetration are free from all reproach of smartness or betrayed effort that it should be a  war novel  makes its triumph all the more sure while all the more surprising but the battlefields of france and flanders so wonderfully poignantly described are here seen as the playgrounds of elemental forces contending for the souls and bodies of poor human victims of two of those victims principally the story tells bringing them on the stage as young society philanderers apparently useless at a ball in midsummer 1914 and tracing their lives through the years of terror when thousands of such men passed severest tests of moral and physical courage joked in the face of death and heartened others by their example in a story running to more than 500 pages there are of course many characters in none of them can the authors skill be said to falter but in adrian knovle and eric sinclair it is at its highest they are not made greek gods they are simply ordinary fellows falling in love dancing when opportunity comes dabbling in literary matters and sampling the strange exotic fads and coteries of london therefore the live talk act and are not dull rosemary the girl whom adrian loves is a weakling blown upon by every warm wind of fashion and fancy she is not strong enough to resist the enticements of a noxious poet of the erotic type and there is a tense scene when adrian rushing impetuously home on leave hears them in conversation together and receives almost a deathblow he seeks death in fact after this cruel disaster to his ideals but death comes to his chum eric instead and adrian lives wounded in body and spirit to find happiness later with the calm steadfast woman whom eric had loved farther than this vague sketch we shall not follow the plot it has many fine episodes both of war and peace without reserve we can  place air ewarts work among the distinguished the novels that matter strong because the personality behind it is strong a living record that will mean much to all who lived and worked and hoped and despaired and lost faith and found it during those five unforgettable years  way of revelation by wilfrid ewart putnam 7s 6d net part of the war scenes in this book originally appeared in the english revew which takes rather a legitimate pride in the full work now expressed in a novel ant in the author in one sense it is the most notable work since the armistice for it deals with realities not with artificial situations and potins and may be likened to henri batailles feu of which it is the english counterpart indeed the war scenes are of historical interest so vivid and tense are they so true so actual but the authors object was twofold not only the front the  back  also figures and this part of the book is disagreeable almost painful in its hideous revelation of life in the world of war profiteering here also the author cuts with a razor edge he is young enough not to fear criticism he has written a startling book a thing that will live as a chronicle of the times andhe has not spared the women whom he shows up in their true garb of safe  patriotism the book is so good that the question must involuntarily be asked is the author a new writer or has he written this one thing from the inspiration of emotion from the need of purging his soul of the tragic memories of the war  we advise people to read this quite one of the best of war novels so far,war

the yellow danger by m p shiel 6s gram richards mr shiel is a mairvellous man his audacity is splendid he foretells the future  a ghastly vision he relates the history of armageddon he slaughters not regiments but races he blows up not ships but fleets he harrows our very souls with prophecies of horror he has written a remarkable an extraordinary book though its excellence is not literaryan extravaganza of unparalleled boldness that whether we laugh or no we cannot well help but read it gratifies our national vanity too for england becomes the refuge of the distracted nations and an english youth saves the world from ruin again and again throughout the pages there is a great complacent roaring of the british lion butsince we speak of roaringthe naval battles are really goodgood reading that is for landsmenwe are no experts and this at least seems true that with our modern apparatus so much stronger as the writer points out for attack than defence the mutual destruction in a battle of ironclads would be appalling on naval matters the book is interesting when it imitates the statesmen from photo byl w g parker d c mr m p shiel and newspapers of the day it is clever when it discourses of tortures it is creepy and when it drowns chinamenmillious of them with outstanding pigtails in the maelstrom it croses the limit of horror and becomes comical mr shiel we repeat is a marvellous man and lis book is a marvellous book sensation lovers should read it they will shudder deliciously all the way sarcastic people will find it entertaining and all who love a plucky writer will admire  the yellow danger reviews by m p shiel grant richards the taste for prophetic fiction is acquired those who follow though advice of sidney smith and  take short views  will have none of it and even others who find pleasure and excitement therein are bound to admit that the novelist is gaining his oifects by something less than the best or most legitimate means but leaving art out of the question it is not possible to withhold commendation from mr shiel if this kind of romance is to be written his certainly is a good way to write it he has worked hard for credibility and ono can in reading this story now and then forget its  previosity altogether but as wo have hinted there are higher forms of fiction the yellow danger is china dr yen how a chinese administrator having weakened europe by international strife for tracts of the celestial empire floods the continent with his countrymen england is threatenedand saved the saviour is a consumptive sailor named john hardy and if the book has any value beyond its efficacy as a beguiler of time it is in hardys character that that value resides long and terrible imprisonment in china under the orders of yen how has filled him with implacable revenge add to this passion real genius for naval warfare an iron will and the knowledge that his disease must soon cut him down and you have a picturesque figure enough the best portions of the book are those which describe hardys naval actions here mr shiel is excellent company with though assistance of plans and a very lucid and forcible narrative gift he makes the encounters perfectly conceivable the book is punctuated with them and they are of enthralling interest people tired of though exiguous newspaper accounts of though engagement in though americanspanish war will find positive refreshment in mr shiels full and convincing methods this passage though not perhaps tho host is the most quotable john hardy as admiral of though english fleet has first ordered no torpedoes to be used in the action and then manoeuvred to get the whole of the chinese vessels in a mass the stages by which such a result was reached are admirably indicated then and thus it has suddenly happened that the whole yellow fleet is packed into a more bundle of ships whose crews can speak to each other whose steersmen need be cautious to avoid collision and when hardy sees them sohorded together by his harsh and baleful forethoughtlike sheep driven into the penfoldhe knows that though yellow wave is dammed and the greatest of his works is accomplished he could shriek aloud with cruel glee    abroad roams his eye over the sea at his sinking and battered fleet and as he looks ho sees though foundering of the nile and swift with concentrated fury the massed japanese open fire upon his feoblo residue at that moment though two limbs of the british are not more than three hundred yurds from the front of the enemy and ut that moment it is that an appalling horrid unparalleled thing is happening to though yellow men hardy hus signalled to his ships to launch among though crowding enemy every possible torpedo in his fleet his prohibition to uso torpedoes in the combat had led his captains to expect some such final order they were well ready the torpedo was of course the most deadly of the then instruments of wur if it exploded boneuth a ship without fail it

the adventures of francois by s weir mitchell 6s macmlllan here is an excellent story the lightest the brightest that dr weir mitchell has yet produced a very close acquaintance with the history and the social conditions of france during the revolution and with the topography of old paris must have preceded the making of it but the learning is skilfully used and never obtruded franvois was a foundling and a chorister of notre dame to whom orderly life iwas made intolerable when his voice broke and he was threatened with the imprisonment of a monastery he took to the wild life of the streets and fought for his own handfor others too he was a goodhearted vagabond it is a novel thing to have a revolutionary story told from the point of view of an irresponsible rascal who cared little for either party though his instincts were royalist but who liked crowds and street riots because purses were loosely held then violence was abhorrent to his easygoing kindly if quite nonmoral nature he would have let politics alone but politics were of a meddling temper in those days and even the poor thief conjurer and fencingmasterfor he rose to that and did not even stop therehad to hold the staircase of a chateau against a mob was a suspect and was imprisoned amongst aristocrats too by a pleasant irony of fate his irrepressible gaiety carried him through strange passes in his life and the triumph of the book is that in the alleged gaiety of fransois we really believe we are infected by it the lighter side of a tragic time has never been so successfully touched before,war

the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,war

the linwoods or sixty years since in america by miss sedg wick churton holles street although the authoress of  hopeleslie  redwood and  the linwoods does not as a novelist possess the untiring activity of cooper the broad humour of paulding or such sudden bursts of keen vivacious satire as emitted by mrs trollope yet she is held by the transatlantic public with great justice in higher esteem than her american literary competitors her novels are imbued with an irresistible charm the charm of truth and by consequence its neverfailing companionthat of sympathy without the superfine metaphysical process of minutely scrutinising and portraying the secret mechanism the various movements and phases of the human heart miss sedgwick exhibits at once and without seeming effort the  open secret of our affections and impulses in a manner so quietthough not the less unerringas must engage the sympathies of every reader be they ever so homely moreover her characters are evidently not the creations of imagination but actual studies from the great life academy of nature we find in the novel before us no exaggerations of fact in no one instance a departure from probability but an easy calm and no less interesting flow of events presenting a more healthy nay greater source of excitement to the  reading public than the sudden transitions or  remarkable events  embodied by the great  wizard of the north himself the title of the book  sixty years since immediately refers its readers to the commencement of the american struggle for independencea retrospect peculiarly favourable to the novelist and of which the authoress of the linwoods has availed herself judiciously and effectively we shall present our readers with an extract affording a peculiarly favourable specimen of the description of talent we have given miss sedgwick credit for as also one of the easy unobtrusive humour she possesses it describes the parting of eliot lee from his family his village friends and the home of his childhood on starting to volunteer in the cause of his country  a fine black saddlehorse well equipped was at the door little fanny lee stood by him patting him and laying her head with its shining flaxen locks to his side  rover she said with a trembling voice be a good roverwont you  and when the naughty regulars come canter off with eliot as fast as you can  hey

have eliot killed no indeed but i had rather hed come deused near it than to have him a coward  dont talk so loud sambessie will hear you but the young belligerent was not to be silenced he threw open the dwellingroom door to appeal to eliot himself the halfuttered sentence died away on his lips he entered the apartment fanny followed they gently closed the door drew their footstools to eliots feet and quietly sat down there how instinctive is the sympathy of children how plain and yet how delicate its manifestations  bessie was sitting beside her brother her head on his shoulder and crying as if her heart went out with every sob the youngest boy hal sat on eliots knee with one arm around his neck his cheek lying on bessies dropping tear after tear sighing and halfwondering why it was so  the good mother had arrived at that age when grief rather congeals the spirit than melts it her lips were compressed her eyes tearless and her movements tremulous she was busying herself in the last offices doing up parcels taking last stitches and performing those services that seem to have been assigned to women as safetyvalves for their effervescing feelings  a neat table was spread with ham

every reason to hope that his future tense will be as perfect as his past  wheugh   exclaimed the major  a pretty long march you have had through that speech   the good schoolmaster quite unruffled proceeded to offer eliot a timeworn virgil and finished by expressing his hopes that  he would imitate caesar in maintaining his studies in the camp and keep the scholar evenhanded with the soldier  eliot charmed the old pedagogue by assuring him that he should be more apt at imitating caesars studies than his soldiership and himself bestowed virgil in his portmanteau of a good lady now stepped forth and seeming somewhat scandalised that as she said  no serious truth had been spoken at this peculiar season she concluded a technical exhortation by giving eliot a pair of stockings into which she had wrought st pauls description of the gospel armour the scripture she feared did not often find its way to the camp and she thought a passage might be blessed as a single kernel of wheat even sowed among tares sometimes produced its like  eliot thanked her and said  it was impossible to have too much of the best thing in the world but he hoped she would have less solicitude about him when

norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale barton cathcart is the son of a farmer who had from a small beginning worked his way to a position of independence and comparative wealth and from this father barton inherits the strong new england spirit of pride energy and force of character modified by a trait of melancholy derived from his mother his sister alicesilent shy and gentleis until the last vohune little better than a lay figure serving as a foil to the brilliancy of her friend rose wentworth the daughter i of the village doctor who himself plays no mean part in  the drama around these twobarton and roseare col  lected various persons who have little indeed to do with j the furtherance of the plot but not one of whom we would 1 be willing to have left out they are as the seasoning to i the dish barton goes to college without any disclosure of 1 his feelings for rose returning to the village only for occa  sional vacations meanwhile she grows up to womanhood i her character formed partly by her fatheran idealist j owning a sympathy with all things animate and inanimate and partly by her fathers housekeeper agate bisselin  every respect the counterpart of miss ophelia in  uncle 1 toms cabin the same conscientiousness the same in  dustry and the same untiring energy which marked that i indefatigable lady rose under this training became as  near perfection as is possible for mortals barton finally i returns from college to take the head of the norwood ara i demy but rn such a state of religious doubt as to prevent j his speaking to roseunwilling to unsettle her peace of mind by confessing his doubts and yet too honourable to conceal them in the meantime frank esel boses artistcousin and tom heywood a young southern gentleman bid fair to become rivals of barton and indeed in the case of frank bose takes the rather doubtful step of refusing him before he proposes heywood is one of the bestdrawn characters in the booka perfect contrast in all things to bartonfair aristocratic with a sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a gentleman wants a decorous faith a good plain sensible worship and then with a good conscience he turns to the enjoyment of life leaving to the deity andexcuse meto the yankees the management of unfathomable mysteries he makes little progress with rose but the arrows aimed for her find their mark in alice cathcart and she learns to love the bright young southerner an accident which happened while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely broken in upon by the news of the bombardment of fort sumter and we have an animated description of the rapidity with which the war summons was answered our friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a representation of american inner life we can thoroughly recommend this work of a man who is in his own person a remarkable representative of the public life of america,war
cease firg by mary johnston 6s constable taken by itself miss mary johnstons new novel  cease firing may seem a ragged piece of work it is likely at times to perplex a reader unacquainted with the authors last book and some misunderstanding would we think have been prevented if the new volume had been plainly put forward as a continuation of  the long roll it is really the second part of a trilogy which is not yet completed slowly and carefully miss johnston is composing a great panorama of the american civil war taken from an unusual point of view a daughter of the south descended from a famous fighting stock she writes with intense and yet restrained partisanship nevertheless she treats the north with the courteous fairness becoming in a virginian of the old school but sadly lacking in the multitude of modern american novelists who take the popular triumphant side in some respects she is rather more of an historian than a novelist in the fine and important work on which she is now engaged the story in  cease firing  is a mere thread which scarcely connects together all the chapters of the book what miss johnston aims at depicting and succeeds in depicting is the whole life of a dying nation for the south was a nation distinct from the north in manners spirit and tradition and this distinction was the fundamental cause of the civil war properly handled the slavery question might have been settled without an armed conflict for a majority of the planters was inclined to some pacific scheme of emancipation but between the industrial democratic northerners and the agricultural gentry of the south there was a division as deep as that which once separated our puritans and cavaliers  free government says one of the characters in cease firing is founded on the consent of the governed and every community strong enough to establish and maintain its independence has a right to assert it my father fought great britain in defence of that principle but being behind the north in industrial power the planters were at last defeated and broken and it is as a tragic picture of a highspirited people in their day of irretrievable disaster that miss johnstons new work fills and touches the mind it is not an historical novel built from books and deriving all its animating power from the writers imagination the author has woven her fine work out of the living memories of her relatives and friends of the older generation the result is a peculiar vividness of treatment the whole struggle of the south is seen in so intimate a way that the living fighting desperate nation becomes the real hero and the individual figures count for what they represent more than for what they singly are the characterization is always clear and interesting but it is merged in the larger subject,war
fiction all our yesterdays by h m tomlinson heinemann 8s 6d this substantial book must we suppose be criticised under fiction though a good deal of it seems like direct memory of fact chosen by the book society for its readers it will put before them one of the best living writers of english it begins with the launching of a great ship a subject in which the author is at his best and he proceeds with the assistance of a few other characters to develop his ironic and disappointed vision of life from the beginning of the twentieth century up to the end of the war we have a row in a musichall a happy tobacco shop with shelves of books which is a haven for the discontented cynically competent journalists including the great harmsworth himself an interior in the slums and another in the drawingroom of the rich it is a slice of real life practical philosophers who think and talk about literature politics and paydays with the racy freedom which does not reach the newspapers before we reach the war one journalist has gone out to tackle the terrors of a lonely jungle and bring supplies to an innocent scientista scheme interrupted by international graft the war section of some 300 pages is finely done but uniformly depressing the world is very wrong for mr tomlinson he sees little good anywhere and hypocritical humbugs in high places typical is his view of the classic mass of st pauls in its immemorial soot with its facings of rainwashed stone as if the chief temple of london was itself a permanent tribute to darkness and was on the point of being absorbed into the power to which it was dedicated it is a pity that our intellectuals have so little belief in england for the english can run themselves down daily without help,war
