memoirs of a highland lady literature edited by lady strachey murray we were once shown a picture by raeburn of an elderly scotchman an elderly scotch gentlewoman and a beautiful scotch girl they were said the owner an uncle who had fought under clive his maiden sister and their nieceall johnstones of alva if memory serves aright that group has been recalled by this most charming book which like the picture suggests a scotch jane austen much more janeaustenish than susan ferrier its author elizabeth grant was born in edinburgh may 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in bombay cathedral to col afterwards general henry smith of baltiboys lived thereafter in ireland and died november 16th 1885 she was the eldest of the five childrentwo sons and three daughtersof sir john peter grant of eothiemurchus 1774  1848 by his english wife jane ironside whose father was a long  descended clergyman at houghtonle spring sir john peter the only son of a doctor had succeeded in 1790 to the rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle he was an edinburgh advocate and london barrister sat as whig member for grimsby and tavistock and in 1827 having frittered away his 2000 a year and gone bankrupt was appointed a judge in bombay and knighted later he was chief justice at calcutta these memoirs written by mrs smith for her children during 184567 come down only to 1830 and record her life in london at thorley hall hertfordshire at the doune in rothiemurchus on speyside at university college oxford of which dr james griffith one of her numberless cousins was master in london again in edinburgh and in india they have already been privately printed and now are generously given to the world with a brieftoo briefintroduction by a niece lady strachey no book of the kind has proved more delightful  if ever i write a novel mrs smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten inspector and received 40 in return that rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel as it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past here is one that is truly wordsworthian the young people were not of rothiemurchus they lived up in glen feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married he was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man i am not sure which but his business was to mind a large hock that pastured on the mountainsat the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty the wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening she would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  my goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  ay but i like the bite replied the creature the book is not purely highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown the future lady byron burnss bonnieleslie one of the cleverest women of her age mrs thrale catalani mrs siddons sir augustus deete the original we believe of harry richmonds father basil hall john clerk of eldin jeffrey canning the abbe sieves and many more emerge and disappear in connexion with prince augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty still after all we like the highland folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it the account of the old edinburgh society is entertaining she classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary she met all varietiesthe jeffreys sir david brewster  the crazy lord buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of queen marys and a bone of james the fifth harry erskine john clerk of eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and sir walter himself there is also a welldrawn portrait of canning whom she met in holland she is most fearless in confessing her opinions she confesses that she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  a coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the dukes arms at dunkeld to blair during the summer season the announcement read as follows pleasing intelligence the duchess of athol starts every morning from the  dukes arms at eight oclock the other is told of lord eldin  some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the west country celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument  wi an epitaph said john clerk in his broadest border dialect  he must hae an epitaph an appropriate epitaph an well change the exordium out o respect instead o the usual here lies well begin his epitaph wi here continues to lie,biography

  nostromo a tale of the seaboard by joseph conrad harper  brothers this is a perfectly amazing book opinions may vary according to the varying degrees of comprehension brought to bear upon it with reference to its interest its charm its artistic completeness and so forth but all will agree that it is an amazing piece of work it is less a novel than an opera in prosethe longest ever written its division into chapters and books appears to be purely arbitrary gratuitous and unnecessary perhaps probably an authors tribute to the fixity of the canons and standards of his art but they have no particular meaning these printed divisions the sounding musio of the tale rises and falls fades and swells advancing ever to the ordered crash of its finale without reference to parts and chapters and with a force and certainty that are at once splendid and fascinating the authors favourite knack of making his characters tell his story for him in narrative style one to another is freely indulged here and with a magnificent disregard for the dangers of digression and retrospection fifty pages of retrospection are as nothing to mr conrad and so fine and strong is his prose so brilliant are the colours he uses that only the trained reader is likely to recognise the daring nature of his method for grim ironic humour it would be hard to match the passage describing the handling by a brutal soldiery of the terrorsmitten israelite hirsch there are whole pages in which every word seems deeply charged with thought though every sentence is vivid and melodious nostromo is a romantic tale of politics adventure and intrigue in a maritime republic of south america yet before all eke it is a novel of character one is inclined to dispute the authors apparent conviction that the man nostromo is the principal figure but that may be only on account of the wealth of characterization lavished upon innumerable other figures in this fine achievement,biography
the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,biography
monthly review of literature domestic and foreign gaston de blndeille or the court of mharu iii keeping festival in ardxen a rolwe by mrs raddiffa 1826 in the memoir of mrs radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes there is so comprehensive and altogether so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy ite breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated departed spirits alas alas gaston de blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to the writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department now we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature the primary ones themselves i love hate ambition jealousy avarice have f their entrances and exits inthe breast but  c these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so i large a space in the basis of all characters c that they are usually and readily excitable ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production and a after even the

a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them dr holmes unlike some othersmay still be trusted with a pen did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it i waltek lewin,biography
memoirs of the comtesse de boigne 1781181m interesting memoirs edited from the original manuscript by m charles nicoullaud heinemann 10s net these memoirs are exactly what memoirs should beto be of value and interest no attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull a great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a european reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be so she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  if i had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory i should have given up my project for i desired a distraction and not a laborious work hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  i regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work i have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair so writes the comtesse de boigne there is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote there is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production death plays too prominent a part when the comtesse de boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother after this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which i had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  i attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  the following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which i could hardly bear begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth and the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work she lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life in this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain there is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself the comtesse de boigne nee charlotte louise eleonore adelaide dosmond loved her name as well she might and she was childless from the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew osmond who became the marquis dosmond to be her heir he was ten years old in 1866 when she died he came into the possessions which she left him in august 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday with his intimate friend m charles nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world for twentyfive years they remained in the possession of m nicollaud to whom the marquis dosmond entrusted them during that time death was busy among the family and the marquis dosmond himself at length died  the family name is extinct the estate of osmond has been sold piecemeal the castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed but into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated what is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them she makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in london or the last days of the court at versailles or the bivouac of cossacks in the champs elysees at the restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of sir john legard with whom her family stayed in yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as chateaubriand or talleyrand or madame de stael or the emperor alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar the attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the tuileries where the ladies of the empire met the ladies of the old court after the return of monsieur there is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts the memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the revolution the empire and the restoration must be of supreme interest and value the translation is good and the notes which the editor m nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness the present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs the second volume bringing the narrative to the revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of louis philippe,biography

autobiography of a supertramp byw h davies with a preface by bernard shaw a c fifield 6s when a few years since a modest volume of poems entitled  the souls destroyer appeared the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken the book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of william h davies we learned just enough to whet our curiosity we learned for instance that the new poet was a onelegged man who lived in a common lodginghouse somewhere in southwark that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s a week and that most wonderful of all he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense this sounded promising  but like oliver twist we wanted more at length mr davies has taken pity on our ignorance he has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life and a marvellous record it is  in these days incident having deserted the region of fiction is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary certainly  the autobiography of a supertramp we like not the title by the way it is too slavishly shavian contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by say mr rolf boldrewood its author has tramped it up hill and down dale  he is equally at home on the highroads of america or in the slums of our english cities he has known the agonies of starvation and by dint of considerable practice has acquired the difficult art of begging his companions have been thieves vagrants and mendicants not since borrow it seems safe to say have we had a presentment so vivid forceful and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people and the strange thing about it all is that mr davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books he has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song and with an eye always on the end of wanderingthe happy haven that awaits the tired voyager it is difficultindeed it is almost impossibleto quote from this volume so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter but one incident in this odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded the scene is america mr davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad they were each fined five dollars by the judge hot with indignation davies refused to disgorge a cent the remainder must be told in his own words  judge stevens looked at us steadily for a time and then asked this astounding question boys how much are you prepared to pay brum who had very little sense of justice and being such a good beggar set very little value on money asked the judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us if i had been alone at this time i would have paid nothing but to save brush from going to prison who i knew would support me through all i satisfied myself that if the judge approved of this amount i would pay it without further comment the judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously and then cried with a magnanimity that was irresistible  pass over the dollars boys  you shall have a chance this time as a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression together with its entire freedom from cant make it in every sense of the term a truly remarkable production mr shaw contributes a characteristic preface  the autobiography of jack ketch with fourteen illus trations from designs by meadows edward churton london if the selfrecorded lives of public men are of importance to society as exemplification of difficulties surmounted on the high road to eminence then assuredly the subject of these memoirs has a claim up on the gratitude of a highspirited and intellectual people and in thus publishing his interesting experience it is certain he will not be the least in their esteem although with some of them it is just possible that he may be the last the appearance of this volume conveys more than is superficially apparent its sombre garb is typical of sorrowthe gaudy label on its back cannot cheat us into any other belief it is the funereal glitter of a gilt plate upon a coffinlid no the fact cannot be concealed jack catch is no longer what he wasno longer the bustling active functionaryhis place is not of the value of a ropesendhis occupations gone the schoolmaster has filched his rod and he is now on the list with titled sinecurists and public pensioners how in this most unprosperous period must his recollection carry him back to the good

of business jack catch had no time to write books then  the utmost he could do was to favour his friends with a line but sessions are long that have no endings the functionarys friends are again in power and jack catch may hope for the results the book is however a more pleasant speculation than the times and here we find the career of the author faithfully narrated from his earliest infancy down to the period when he takes office by succeeding his uncle to the important post of representative of the sheriff of london our hero first saw the light in the  darksome secrecy of rose and crown court and with an independence truly original does not claim hereditary respectability but says  let me not mince the matter for mincing it will not make the matter lessmy father was a thief isle was however professedly a waiter but his napkin was not large enough to cloak his little peculiarities and he met his fate at the new drop kindly assisted by his respected relative his mother his  sainted mother shortly afterwards laid herself open to a suspicion of not  accurately distinguishing the right of property and was commanded to  expatriate herself for life here then commences the career of our hero virtually an orphan by the laws of his country the entire code of which he declared open war with in his subsequent career morc we are obliged to confess from his natural tastes than from pious revenge for the wrongs of his parents it would deprive the work of half its interest with the reader were we to proceed with it in the elaborate way we could wish we will therefore merely say that the introluction into life of the thief and the vagabond was through the appropriate medium of an attorlneys officgithere he was introduced to some few of the choicest blackguards in a small way about town  but upon the natural event of his master absconding with the money of his  only respectable clientjack was thrown upon his own resourses and went through the degrees of pickpocket housebreaker and common cheat until he arrived at the dignified position in society which he now holds the work is illustrated by meadows and we are enabled by the permission of the publisher to give specimens which will speak for themselves of the merits of the artist this woodcut represents the wife of jack catch weeping over her dead birlcatherine is a most masterly delineation of the author of the patient ediurance of a female tinder circumstances of the most heartbreaking wronlg and ildignityshe is the likeness of a being of every lay life the fidelity of which we cannot but recogiiizeomie whose affections no iiijury can abate no cruelty subdue who without a murmur clings to the husband of her choise through good and evil even to death but that part which displays the greatest kinowledge of the human mind is an episodle callel the  confession of johin wilson jack ketch in passinl lown the borough sees his uncle getting off a stagecoach he hadjust returned from some professional affair in the country and had in his pocket a m1s which the unifortunate for whom he had officiated had intrusted to him to deliver to the clergyman of e  jack goes home with his micle and reads it aloud this is the most striking tale that we have read for many years ini fact we have seen nothinjg like it since caleb williamsit is the philosophy of crimethe motives which are supposed to actuate the human heart to the commission of the most frightful atrocities are developed and laid bare anid embodied in a tale of the most powerful interest this woodcut does the artist great credit it represents the children of wilson finding the knife with which he murdered his friend many years before the little creatures bring it to their father and the sight of it produces a revulsion of feeling which at last occasions the crime for which he suffered jacks uncle one morning is discovered suspended to a beam by one of his own ropeswhether a victim to professional experiment or occasioned by one of those fits of aberration to which minds peculiarly constructed are subject must be left a matter of conjecture having an eye to respectability or rather finding his own pursuits not the most lucrative he applies for the vacant situation which by family influence and a nature aptitude for the profession he at length obtains here he is passing his examination

of office let no one be prejudiced by those quidnunc critics who affect to be disconcerted by the title of a book or fancy that a dark cover must conceal dulness we venture to assert that there is more interest in this little volume than in all the novels brought out this season in the first eight or nine chapters there is wit lurking in every line and we may truly say that every period has its point the continuation abounds with interesting situations forcible delineations of character anl startling eventsthe conclusion is perfectly in keeping with the whole those who look further into a book than the titlepage will find a fund of entertainment they little dream of and we sincerely recommend it to our readers as a work that in proportion as it is known cannot fail to be

the professor at the breakfasttable  with the story of iris by oliver wendell holmes ticknor  fields london low  co prenticeana or wit and humour in paro graphs by the editor of the louisville journal new york derby  jackson london low  co miss martineau characterised american con versation as prosy rich and droll we i int have been reminded of her epithets by the i to professors welcome book dr holmes i holds a high place in the light literature of  america he is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists there is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what mrs j da pringle in gaits  ayrshire legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent with all this the story of iris approves dr holmes to be an american writerthe number of mysterious girls who figure in transatlantic fiction is appalling such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not

clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 eanions in the house yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the i  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  john the young man john asked me to come up one day and try some old burbon which lc he said was al on asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that i shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way i followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking i might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity mighty close quarters they were where the young man john bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  barnum presenting ossian e dodge to jenny

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies practice walking the more graceful they become in their movements those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one a graceful correctionthe proper study of mankind is womanpunch woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive a kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  a miss way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a kentucky lawyer in that city after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from congo squareexchange does she propose to take the kentucky lawyer up with her or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon brigham young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of utah are her women it is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources the last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers  the poet of the breakfast table saturday november 2 1872 literature by oliver wendell holmes routledge  sons we have had the autocrat and the professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour we cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded it would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the poet like the autocrat and professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly the breakfasttable series is now complete its fault is its extreme length the poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse if he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as pas trop de zele the poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue there are fourteen persons at the breakfast table the opposite ends are occupied by the landlady and the capitalist on one side are the poet the scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a man of letters a master of arts a young girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called scheherazade and the lady on the other side are dr b franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the astronomer the member of the haouse as the legislator calls himself the registrarof deeds the salesman and that boy the lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community he turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary in this company the poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures they are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries the poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match the following are among very numerous examples  it aint just the thing to grease your ex with the isle of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do again   it is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle cotton mather was miserable all his days i am afraid after that entry in his diary  this day dr sewele was chosen president for his piety1 we may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal americans believe that there are no hs in england and frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  however we could match the goodlooking landlady of the poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope the daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the order of things and who remarks  i hope to do some sound thinking in heavenif i ever get there  fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects the first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted they have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from heaven the groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem we approve of the old masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed i dont like your chopped music any way that woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesflorence nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowiez out isnt not that exactly but something like it i have been to hear some music pounding after describing the concert with much humour he adds i like to hear a woman sing and i like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me i know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and pop went a small piece of artillery    that boy was in his seat looking demure enough the master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which i saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our great organthat himalayan home of harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often there is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  i thank god that a great many people believe a great deal more than i do i think when it comes to serious matters i like those who believe more than i do better than those who believe less there is no doubt that this is a general feeling we endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   it is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it if he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone in quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the breakfast table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids the character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the young girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the weekly bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it the poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul she ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail i spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night the poet thinks the toiling scheherazade of the weekly bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story

  the later years of catherine de medici reviews catherine de medici by edith sichel archibald constable and co this is an eminently readable if not a very valuable book miss sichel frankly admits in her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact and has detected no error in accepted dates she has sought to paint the portrait of catherine de medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny she says  here in paris near the louvre beneath the window whence catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of st bartholomew     or near that other window which looked out upon the fastcrimsoning seine  it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past in fact miss sichels book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts but surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities that the window of the louvre overlooking the seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the st bartholomew massacre considerably postdates that tragic event for the sake of a picture however the most vivid details are sure to be selected and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt and this makes the kind of portraiture which miss sichel practises of small worth to the student and even misleading in certain cases but the method has a value of its own it supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history it gives him more than does the historical novel and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do to the appreciation of which qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable there is a danger however that the colouring of the picture may be overdone that the perspective may be false it is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice men historians often enough fall into the same fault under the influence of political and religious bias but with women it seems impossible to avoid it women are born into the world to love and love always entails hate miss sichel is not far from hating catherine de medici and the age of the renaissance in which she lived she writes  the ligue was the counterpart of catherine we have compared it to the great french revolution but there is this vital difference between the two the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea it was the beginning of an erathe death of catherine closed an epoch with her died the age of the renaissance and with the reign of henry iv there came the dawn of modern timesit was the destiny of catherine de medici to imbibe the poison of either influence that of the reformation and that of the renaissance from the reformation she derived its abusesits degradation of religion into politics its gross polemic materialism the more pernicious for priestly vestments from the renaissance she inhaled its stagnant paganism its cold curiosity its stupid blindness to aught but the senses its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in there are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men it is the death of the ideal of faith in man of faith in anything outside him these were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others history provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but sometimes unconsciously it reveals to us certain moral laws it is a medium for them not a pulpit if any person any age is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality that age is the reign of the last valoisthat person is catherine de medici most if not all of this is fustianlittle better indeed than sheer nonsense in the first place it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras epochs ages and modern times strictly speaking there is no such thing as an era an epoch an age or modern times with every minute that goes by the middle ages for instance are getting further and further away from the middle assumingwhich is of course not the case that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end to tell us that the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning and if miss sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the french revolution she is assuredly mistaken if anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudoclassical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movementa pseudoclassicism which by the way achieved among other things the complete destruction of the art of painting in franceat any rate for the presenta curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received especially as it is highly typical the gross polemic materialism of the reformation the more pernicious for priestly vestments is unfair to a highly complex movement one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison detre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism to accuse the renaissance of stupid blindness to aught but the senses is far too sweeping a charge and indeed a stupid one whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been the christian world owes to the renaissance an immense debt to say that catherine de medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man which he has never been without as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge is to give that good lady who had her commendable points an importance which she never possessed and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft  of the meed of immortality with miss edith sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency history she says provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page which is her last yet although for long men did not know it they were aremaking towards a common goal and using a common watchword that watchword that goal is freedom making f or  moving  is a slang expression but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist  of what use is the historian any way if he is not to be a conscious moralist with history or as much as he can find out about it as his text which is a theological text into the bargain  for the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of good over evil and in that conclusion we are entirely we think in accord with miss edith sichel,biography

dickens is not so inhuman as to be absolutely faultless some suggest modifications and point out how they would have planned it if it had been theirs to write some are in raptures over one part some over another and some very particular fellows are carping at every part the judgments on lileah house are in short as various as judgments are apt to be upon a man whoso failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him and his books are bought and read by everybody that this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of its readers with new groups of people as familiar and real as any that in life they may have known  that it overflows with inimitable grace and tenderness that it is stored with the most subtle wit

treating his tom jones as an epic upon this high ground we must stand if we would properly discuss lileah house it touches and amuses us but it is destined to draw teare and smiles also from our childrens children mr dickens has a large public in the present and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future the world will grow wiser than it is the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappearbut the spirit in which he writes and to which he appeals is indestructible  and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah house has relation to its plot the conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole und to interfere with though steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue but let us in the present instance with no less justice remark that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole the studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah house is very manifest event leads to event and chance words or though deeds of chance people that seem perfectly irrelevant are seen everywhere precisely as in real life exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death of happiness or misery to men and women perfectly unknown to them taking the mere surface view of such treat ment it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connexion and design and to display in the j attempt only our own very real want of sagacity this subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents is in fact truer to nature infinitely truer than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world its drawback is that it compels the uso tf a huge number of characters which come and go during though progress of the story  und j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journeys end over the  ground he has traversed they may now and then cause some j confusion in the readers mind mid produce an etlect like j that of an overcrowded picture 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault  he this as it may never in any former work has mr j dickens made use of a plot so evidently planned before hand with minute consideration or throughout so elaborately studied even the lits of the little lawstationers servant aid directly in the chain of little things that lead indirectly to though catastrophe of lady dedlocks death so dexterously indeed an the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah house that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them as a mere cloud of isolated incidents a novel j may havo its too superficial readers as life has its too hasty obsorvers at though closo of his preface mr dickens marks

to have made the plot itself a connected story of a chancery suit would havo beeu except for though merest commonplace ono of though clumsiest and most impracticable designs conceivable mr dickens knew hotter what he was alout and though use made of jarndyco v jamdyco in lileah house is always complete and masterly fjthe other grand feature of the tale connected also closely yet quito naturally with this is the dedlock household lt is brought out with equal power with the same thoughtful elaboration aud with as perfect a result not only have we sir leicester a truo gentleman with all his weaknesses and lady dedlock the supercilious woman of fashion with a busy heart painfully throbbing beneath that hard and quiet outside but yolumnia and though cousins the town house and the footmen

aud construction absolutely wonderfulthe power aud care spent upon though group are unceasingly exerted yet so successfully as to bear no trace of effort to keep it throughout iu that central position towards which the other sections of though tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge taking the story piecemeal as a mero gallery of pictures and persons we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah house finer than anything that even mr dickens has yet produced in the same way exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former writings wo can remember none by which we have been touched so deeply or that has been graced by so much of the very finest writing as though entire tale of the streetwandering joe as it may be gathered from the pages of the book before us in though trooper george though ragnets and their humble household we have another of those fine broad hearty exemplifications of humour in which mr dickens delights in which all though ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all nothing is repulsive  everything is large laughable and true and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness the character of esiher summerson has been much elaborated and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything mr dickens has ever writtenindeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it full as it is of noble fancies and delicate and graceful thoughts but wo suspect that mr dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities we cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone which if not selfconsciousness is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of though character depicted yet the graces and virtues of esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them  and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues mrs jelly by and her despondent husband her daughter caddy and though turveydrops the trooper george and his man phil the brickmakers wives and the dead infant the lawstationer and his little woman roy thorn and ski dipole mr chadband and the coavinses the mother of mr  uppy the inscrutable and impassable tulkinghorn to say nothing of 1 poor miss flite or the immortal bucket and a dozen others j have been added here to the long list of ideal people with j whom mr dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted mr dickenss characters as all the world knows pass their names into our language and become types lt is  an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature to personify some main idea which are ever after found universally applicable such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since though beginning of all literature they know little how much there is in any ono mans head or heart who expect to have every i character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological  dissecting table and demonstrated minutely we see nobody minutely in real life the rough estimates we form of character aro on though whole if we possess any tact correct  but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes and it is the prominences the sharp i angles that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling hence it is therefore as well as for i other reasons that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters though rest ofthe sketch is filled iup by the reader or spectator instinctively and sufficiently i out of his own experience squire allworihy rlifil philosopher square parson adams trulliber and all the rest of fieldings characters were formed upon this plan  nor was it thought unjust or unnatural by the great novelist to give distinctness to thc picturo in each case by just so much of genial strength and breadth of colouring as should prevent his idea from being impressed too faintly on the public mind it is for the most part much more easy than correct to cry outexaggeration wo may be only betray ing our ignorance after all thero is an eastern saying to the effect that there is in the world precisely what the eye can find in it and let us not suppose that what limits our viewin any particular direction should of necessity be an equal restriction to thc view of a man of genius of mr dickens it is to bo said if of any oue that his main strength has lain in the ability to concentrate his thoughts on objects external to himself if his mero personality were at every turn set up as the limit aud bound to his perceptions if it were still his recurring habit to tako his own character as the infallible test of all other characters ho would in each fresh essay be always retracing only the old weary ground rut ready and cager at all times with genial warmth and fulness to enter in all the peculiarities of others we have him continually throughout his books apprehending and interpreting iew forms of character and truth and carrying with each new achievement of his

shorter reviews i madeleine at her mirror a womans diarv by marcelle tinayre john lane 6s  m me tinayre writes with such a light fantastic m touch that her books are always enjoyable reading the present volume as she herself says  is not a novel but a collection of impressions of dreams and of memories in which fiction mingles with fact it is also we are inclined to think in no small degree autobiographical some of us delight in building castles in the air others will become lost in thought as they watch the embers on the homely hearth but madeleine sits before her mirror and gazes into it evoking reminiscences of other days which she records in a dainty style that forcibly reminds one of the late gustave droz especially in his delightful work  monsieur madame et bebe madeleine conjures up thoughts and recollection of a multitude of subjects mostly of the piquant gossamer kind which is innate in the parisienne but occasionally striking a more serious note showing that life is not all frivolity frills and furbelows and that laughter has at times to give way to tears the sketches slight as they are display an intimate knowledge of woman and her ways and the authoress lampoons her foibles with no hesitating pen the chapters beauty secrets friendship among women women and their dressmakers divulge many home truths which a mere man could scarcely hint at women at sales depicts the little wild beast   feverishly turning over scarves and laces in a caressing manner which no husband or lover will ever know but it is when madeleine discusses mode and maternity that she is most scathing towards her sex the present fashion if exaggerated becomes the negation of femininity the tight fitting garments of today make prospective maternity immodest   modem woman is a pretty careless creature who does not think who seldom loves and who never becomes a mother she is a soulless heartless doll look at our parisiennes how they flatten any prominence of figure how they diet themselves how they confine their bodies in mummylike sheathes in order to attain to the literary ideal of the perverted angel according to madame tinayre who is evidently no believer in as good be out of the world as out of the fashion this regrettable state of things is in the main due to our latterday novelists it is a pity that several of her pages are disfigured by some very careless printers errors has that gentlemans reader become as extinct as the dodo,biography
  joseph vance an iluwritten autobio graphy by william de morgan heinemann the complaint mav possibly be made that  joseph vance has little or no plot but is a plot a necessary part of a book which professes to be an autobiography  the life of the average man is neither a tragedy nor a comedy and it would be hard to find in his autobiography a satisfactory plot  joseph vance  impresses the reader as the truthful record of a life and as that is what the author intended we need not lament the absence of a plot the book is written in a leisurely fashion it suggests the talk of an intelligent man who has something to say and all night in which to say it and the listener must be unusually obtuse who does not find pleasure in listening there is abundance of humour in mr de morgans story and it is found not only in the humorous remarks made by the author but also in the essentially humorous characteristics of several of the people to whom he introduces us the reader may fancy that the task of reading will be long enough to be tiresome  but if he has any appreciation of work that is humorous thoughtful pathetic and thoroughly entertaining he will not regret the length of the story  joseph vance  is fresh original and unusually clever if it is the authors first effort as is apparently the case his next book will le looked for with interest,biography
memoirs of the comtesse de boigne 1781181m interesting memoirs edited from the original manuscript by m charles nicoullaud heinemann 10s net these memoirs are exactly what memoirs should beto be of value and interest no attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull a great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a european reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be so she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  if i had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory i should have given up my project for i desired a distraction and not a laborious work hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  i regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work i have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair so writes the comtesse de boigne there is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote there is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production death plays too prominent a part when the comtesse de boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother after this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which i had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  i attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  the following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which i could hardly bear begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth and the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work she lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life in this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain there is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself the comtesse de boigne nee charlotte louise eleonore adelaide dosmond loved her name as well she might and she was childless from the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew osmond who became the marquis dosmond to be her heir he was ten years old in 1866 when she died he came into the possessions which she left him in august 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday with his intimate friend m charles nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world for twentyfive years they remained in the possession of m nicollaud to whom the marquis dosmond entrusted them during that time death was busy among the family and the marquis dosmond himself at length died  the family name is extinct the estate of osmond has been sold piecemeal the castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed but into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated what is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them she makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in london or the last days of the court at versailles or the bivouac of cossacks in the champs elysees at the restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of sir john legard with whom her family stayed in yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as chateaubriand or talleyrand or madame de stael or the emperor alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar the attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the tuileries where the ladies of the empire met the ladies of the old court after the return of monsieur there is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts the memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the revolution the empire and the restoration must be of supreme interest and value the translation is good and the notes which the editor m nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness the present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs the second volume bringing the narrative to the revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of louis philippe,biography

the white peacock by d h lawrence heinemann this novel is a characteristic specimen of the modern fiction which is being written by the feminine hand the older ideas and ideals are sacrificed ruthlessly to an attempt to breathe vitality into a succession of cinematographic pictures illustrative of the lives of the dramatis personal there is however no selection as this method would suggest impressions are merely scattered at random it is as it were paulopostimpressionism in fiction that there is cleverness in thismodern study of nerves is obvious from the first chapter but it is equally impossible to avoid the conclusion that the characters were spun in the authors brain there is no verisimilitude farmers daughters talk high culture and an ordinary readers head whirls in trying to determine the social relations of the sundry people involved scenes seem introduced merely because the author has observed them or thought of them not because they add anything to the plot or even to the atmosphere such is the modern method which a growing school of writers in this country encourages but which as we have pointed out before owes its conception rather to zola than to english sources the author of the white peacock is never realistic with the crudity of the master but she is needlessly frank to a fastidious mind as the trend of the novel in general seems to be in this direction she should be successful particularly when she has learned her craft better there are suggestions and even more than suggestions of the making of a fine style in her writing  the white peacock by d h lawrence heinemann injd h lawrence we have a new writer one most certainly to be reckoned with it is his first book we understand and he is quite young quite unknown the white peacock should be read the book stands out among the ruck of contemporary fiction unmistakably as a work of artistic and literary excellence as the writing of a man who knows he will achieve both fame and distinction it is not perhaps a very good novel mr lawrence is somewhat prolix in his conversations his lifes orbit would seem a little limited there are loquacious oases of rather heavy and almost suburban dulness but there are flashes of real genius touches of physical interpretation a skill of observation a zeal of life a glow of intellect and above all a wonderful sensitiveness of art and nature which mark the writer as a real force he still needs craft the unerring craft of a wells he needs experience there is nothing much in the story which is the study of a little country circle without much incident or movement yet the book has a great fascination the scent of the countryside is all about it these people of his are realthere are some extraordinarily good descriptive scenesand the end is real no mawkish sentimentality no boyandgirl book this a true piece of writing revealing in places the sense of beauty and passion of a quite remarkable talent  fiction the white peacock by d h lawrence heinemanil 6s i hithidro we have only known mr d h lawrence as being one of the many interesting poets discovered by the english review henceforth we shall certainly know him as the author of the white peacock for it is beyond all argument an admirable and astonishing piece of work we use the word  astonishing  advisedly for like most new books of uncommon merit  the white peacock  surprises even while it charms there are pages in it that made the present reviewer a sophisticated and disillusioned reader of novels lay down the book and rub his eyes in wonder at the authors individuality and courage it is no very new story that he has to tell that a young woman should encourage two young men at once and should end by marrying the wrong one is possibly even more frequent in fiction than in life again that the slighted lover should thereon marry beneath him and take to drink is only ill accordance with the best traditions of the ingenuous school of novelists but in the hands of mr lawrence this old theme is quickened with new life the action takes place in the rural districts of nottinghamshire and it would hardly be fanciful to say that nature is the protagonist of the drama and that the author has drawn her character with uncommon care we realise her in all her moods and she is as interesting as she is convincing nor has the author taken less pains with the drawing of those special manifestations of nature that are called men and women the heroine is a delightful picture of a lively clever girl who likes excitement of all kinds and especially the rather dangerous excitement of leading passionate men on to making passionate love mr lawrences unravelling of this heedlessness is almost uncanny in its shrewdness but his greatest success is the character of george the farmerlover whose defeat and degradation supply the book with its motive this is a really masterly study of passion now wordless and pitiful now strung to its utmost intensity of selfexpression when the man realises his weakness and his own words hurt him like blows lettie loves his physical strength and the completeness of his submission and wisely enough according to her lights marries the other man because his money and social position make him a more suitable match it is clever of mr lawrence to compel us to sympathise both with george and lettie we are made to feel that they are both hard driven by their natures and are not to be blamed for the inevitable catastrophe but in truth of all the many characters in the book there is not one who does not move within the bounds of our sympathy the men are men the women women and the children who appear all too rarely are such children that we hope the author will be more generous of them in his next work apart from the characterisation the book would stand by its vivid pictures of a country life that is new to us where side by side with the primitive roughness that lingers wherever men and women till the soil the new ideas have taken root and are apparently about to flourish the author treats of the primitive with praiseworthy frankness and there is no denying the interest of the spectacle of a young farmer looking at aubrey beardsleys illustrations for the first time it is apparent to us that mr d h lawrence is one of those rare writers who intends only to tell the truth as he sees it and nothing but the truth as a consequence he has given us a book of considerable achievement and infinite promise,biography

new york derby  jackson london low  co miss martineau characterised american con versation as prosy rich and droll we i int have been reminded of her epithets by the i to professors welcome book dr holmes i holds a high place in the light literature of  america he is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists there is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what mrs j da pringle in gaits  ayrshire legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent with all this the story of iris approves dr holmes to be an american writerthe number of mysterious girls who figure in transatlantic fiction is appalling such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt

him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that i shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way i followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking i might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity mighty close quarters they were where the young man john bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  barnum presenting ossian e dodge to jenny

in eatin when i cut up an old fowl and help the boarders i always feel as if i ought to say wont you have a slice of widdahinstead of chicken the young man john fell into a train of reflections which

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of

washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the

certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is

the spendthrift by francis dodsworth grant richards the binding of the spendthrift is the reverse of engaging but it is not an unfitting keynote to the contents it is a novel of the turf and racecourse and the air of knowledge and truth is the most satisfactory thing about it one feels that the author knows his ground that the rise and fall of the youthful gambler are written by an experienced and shrewd observer of certain phases of life it is a pitiful story and the nard unrelenting realism but adds to the pity of it the spendthrift has no charm of personality or manner  even his callow youth shows none of the early enthusiasms or generous romance that even modern training does not always entirely obliterate  the spendthrift by francis dodsworth 6s richards  the spendthrift  is a vigorous bit of work the material is ably put together and the characterisation is within its limits shrewd and terse the writers firsthand knowledge or close study of the turf will also be counted to his merits at an hour when storytellers are encouraged to be specialists yet we seriously doubt if the book was worth writing even as an awful warning as a soiemn moral lesson it can hardly reconcile us to its sordidness it is a much cherished belief that every mans life if it be honestly told is worth telling but it is not the truth such a story as this is profitless and without interest there is no relief to the dreary commonplace of an existence like devans he is without heart without intelligence without any stirrings in his being save the obstinate desire of gain the obstinate resignation to loss inspired by the billiardroom the cardtable and the turf there is no tragedy in his life which in its miserable end was a paltry fulfilment of its possibilities fatigue rather than regret killed him at the last some flitting generous impulses in a woman some kindly ministrations of a servant there are but the woman and the servant are only shadows and rouse but faint instincts of sympathy in us even the least pharisaical may turn away with a weary expression of gratitude for their unlikeness to this mere betting and gambling machine,biography
  joseph vance an iluwritten autobio graphy by william de morgan heinemann the complaint mav possibly be made that  joseph vance has little or no plot but is a plot a necessary part of a book which professes to be an autobiography  the life of the average man is neither a tragedy nor a comedy and it would be hard to find in his autobiography a satisfactory plot  joseph vance  impresses the reader as the truthful record of a life and as that is what the author intended we need not lament the absence of a plot the book is written in a leisurely fashion it suggests the talk of an intelligent man who has something to say and all night in which to say it and the listener must be unusually obtuse who does not find pleasure in listening there is abundance of humour in mr de morgans story and it is found not only in the humorous remarks made by the author but also in the essentially humorous characteristics of several of the people to whom he introduces us the reader may fancy that the task of reading will be long enough to be tiresome  but if he has any appreciation of work that is humorous thoughtful pathetic and thoroughly entertaining he will not regret the length of the story  joseph vance  is fresh original and unusually clever if it is the authors first effort as is apparently the case his next book will le looked for with interest,biography

in the beginning bv norman doutlas 7 tit c hatto  winlu this is a story of very long agoof the days  when immortals sought pleasure where they found itnot only in their own celestial halls but among the sons and daughters of earth days when mankind walked naked without shame and the thing called sin had not been invented the characters are gods and mortals and halfmortals and satyrs it is a little difficult to know which are which and what they are all about their love affairs are described with the frankness proper to the period but mr douglass heroes and heroines are likely to be less interesting to the average reader than the more mundane modern kind now and then there are flashes of wit and irony such as we expect from mr douglas but on the whole it is not easy to know just what he is tilting at but he himself seems to enjoy the joke some of us will perhaps feel inclined to leave it to him while we have another look at  south wind and wonder what has happened to that norman douglas,biography
memoirs of the comtesse de boigne 1781181m interesting memoirs edited from the original manuscript by m charles nicoullaud heinemann 10s net these memoirs are exactly what memoirs should beto be of value and interest no attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull a great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a european reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be so she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  if i had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory i should have given up my project for i desired a distraction and not a laborious work hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  i regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work i have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair so writes the comtesse de boigne there is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote there is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production death plays too prominent a part when the comtesse de boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother after this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which i had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  i attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  the following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which i could hardly bear begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth and the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work she lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life in this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain there is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself the comtesse de boigne nee charlotte louise eleonore adelaide dosmond loved her name as well she might and she was childless from the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew osmond who became the marquis dosmond to be her heir he was ten years old in 1866 when she died he came into the possessions which she left him in august 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday with his intimate friend m charles nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world for twentyfive years they remained in the possession of m nicollaud to whom the marquis dosmond entrusted them during that time death was busy among the family and the marquis dosmond himself at length died  the family name is extinct the estate of osmond has been sold piecemeal the castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed but into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated what is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them she makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in london or the last days of the court at versailles or the bivouac of cossacks in the champs elysees at the restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of sir john legard with whom her family stayed in yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as chateaubriand or talleyrand or madame de stael or the emperor alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar the attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the tuileries where the ladies of the empire met the ladies of the old court after the return of monsieur there is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts the memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the revolution the empire and the restoration must be of supreme interest and value the translation is good and the notes which the editor m nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness the present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs the second volume bringing the narrative to the revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of louis philippe,biography
the celebrated madame camfan lady in waiting to marie antoinette and confidant of napoleon by violette m montagu eveleigh nash 15s net hortense has a beautiful disposition we understand one another so perfectly were almost the last words of that survivor of hundreds of wrecked fortunes madame campan it was because she cottld see the beauty in the disposition of many such people as the queen of holland and because her quick and sympathetic nature enabled her to understand perfectly so many of her friends and pupils that she has become one of the most interesting figures in french social history in her wonderful and useful career are interwoven the symbolic bees of napoleon and the bourbon lilies of franceboth stained with the blood of the revolution and ofas it now seemsuseless wars long before we begin miss violette montagus wellarranged and admirably clear account of madame campan we are interested in her but all is newly set forth with skill and leisure from the birth of henriette genist and her acquaintance with the roi bienaime until the last line is penned and this remarkable woman lies in 1822 at peace at last in the cemetery at mantes the intention of the author of this book has been as she says to present a faithful picture of the france of the eil de boeuf and of that greater france when no education was considered complete without a sojourn in paris that parnassus whither napoleon the master mind invited the worlds most gifted artists musicians litterateurs scientists and thinkers this is a bold undertaking but one for which miss montagu would be perfectly fitted but for an occasional efflorescence of style and a slight inclination to wander from the matter in hand but as her more direct work  eugene de beauharnais proved she knows the vast numbers of memoirs of the period perfectly and is completely at ease in later eighteenth and early nineteenth century france while dealing with the fortunes of her heroine all the hurrying pushing palpitating world of louis xv louis xvi of the revolution of the napoleonic era and the confused time that followed are laid before us how low men were and how they rise how high they were and how they tumble o vanity of vanities o laughable pathetic jumble  that is the sort of picture one sees once more in miss montagus interesting pages it is true that much has been told to us before almost all the characters are historical but the author endows them with new life and adds a thousand little touches gathered from wide reading or personal observation which make her story of maman campanfor she was a mother to all the great or wouldbe great ladies of the empirefresh and delightful the reader of today need not trouble himself about the rather heavy and at the same time elusive volumes of memoirs which madame left us for miss montagu has adjusted the stilted style to modern taste the first part of the volume dealing with the court of marie ivntoinette is to some extent madame campans own work wisely edited and assisted by much knowledge gleaned from other and equally useful sources the second part which the author calls the governess of the bonapartes is founded on some of the correspondence between madame campan and the mother of napoleon iii who was of course under her care as hortense de beauharnais and among all her beloved pupils the most beloved the fates may not have allowed all the girls who were brought up by madame campan to prove later very kind or very clever but the governess at least saw that their minds and bodies were perfectly healthy while she could influence them and her carefully thought out methods certainly produced many capable witty women and caused a tradition of wise education to flourish in france even until today madame herself came of a family famous during generations for their taste for hard work and common sense for caution and in some cases coldness but the fine flower of their race the henriette of the present volume combined much knowledge of men and things with wide sympathy and much warmth of character with wisdom which was both lively and discreet from the days when a child lectrice she entered the court of louis xv as the companion of his daughters to the very end she held in her heart the spirit of a devoted and unselfish mother and although her own marriage made by her parents of coursewas unhappy she never failed to make lighter the burdens which others had to bear at fourteen miss montagu says her heroine was in danger of becoming a bluestocking for she was quick and clever and made much of by the various masters of the arts of the day albanesi the most fashionable of singing masters taught her the melodies of the alluring lully while goldoni himself made her familiar with italian the little picture of her as she comes into prominence shows that the bluestocking period was soon over miss montagu pictures her entering the great world wearing a long train her slender figure enclosed in stiff stays and voluminous panniers with her little tearstained face besmirched with rouge and powder her father had given her many wise warnings whenever you receive flattering attentions he said you will gain an enemy of flattery and enemies madame campan had her fair share as the years passed but her head was always cool and her heart true and sound and thus she survivedthe friend of humanity through so many and such various periods of court life her character and her surroundings make her a particularly interesting subject for such a volume as miss montagu gives us it is the life of a wise and sympathetic woman written by anotherand such an alliance will always make a delightful book,biography

black magic  pfr amica silentia lunve   is a book for the yeats enthusiast that is to say we should not recommend it to any one who has anything else of mr yeatss still to read a man who knows only  innisfree and  the heavens embroidered clothes  may be left happily with the rest of the poems with the  stories of red hanrahan and should he wish to know something of the poets life with the exquisite  reveries over childhood and youth in  per amica silentia luna mr yeats is less often exquisite than affected it is not his genius that he reveals to us here but some curious crannies of his mind of course mr yeatss mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind and well worth exploring  but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about there are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle here for instance are two consecutive sentences  one night i heard a voice that said   the love of god for every human soul is infinite for every human soul is unique  no other can satisfy the same need in god our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death but only that we should seek it in those who are dead even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom they need mr george robeys interpreting  in other words to simplify them they are the means however by which mr yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts there was no need for mr yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of per amica silentia luna by w b yeats macmillan  co 45 dd net words we are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it mr yeats says   i have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of indian and japanese poets old women in connaught mediums in soho because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world we wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says   faith is the one gift that man can make to god it is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following   all souls have a vehicle or body and when one has said that with more and the platonists one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some church or institution and found oneself with great poetry and superstition which is but popular poetry in a pleasant dangerous world mr yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions he is saying what he means however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose he believes that every great man has a demon to mingle with his life it is a daemon literally and not figuratively speaking who inspires every man of genius the demon who is the creator of the work of art mr yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement and divides them from one another under the names of self and antiself self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses antiself is the daemon maker of a thing far greater than the man himself it is in his attempted explanation of his belief that mr yeats like other theologians breaks down he bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal he experiences what one would describe if one were speaking of oneself as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself mr yeats describes his sensation thus  when i come home after meeting men who are strange to me and sometimes even after talking to women i go over all i have said in gloom and disappointment perhaps i have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle from hostility that is but fear or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy my fellow  diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity and how should i keep my head among images of good and evil crude allegories r how indeed  did not charles lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellowguest had the misfortune to ask if milton was a great poet   but when i shut my door and light my candle i invite a marmorean muse an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different for now there must be no reaction action only and the world must move my heart but to the hearts discovery of itselfall my thoughts have ease and joy i am all virtue and confidence it is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that mr yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work he will not accept the commonplace idea that this  heroic condition  is his true self he regards it rather as  the lord of terrible aspect  who appeared to dante and said  egodominus tuus  the descent of the demon who when the moment of creation comes makes for mr yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius  when i consider the minds of my friends says mr yeats  among artists and emotional writers i discover a like contrast and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work there is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse but with women or liquor in their lives  and mr yeats refers to dantes lechery and shakespeares  pottle pot  with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate but this division into self and antiself is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind it is impossible to divide personality with a butchers cleaver one may get interesting generalisation as the result but one will not get truth if mr yeatss theory were correct psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose the elements of a mans nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air and the air with the veining branches of the tree,biography

the romance of sandro botticelli woven from his paint mgs by a j anderson illustrated stanley paul and co ios 6d net judging from its title the majority of readers will doubtless suppose this book to be a biographical work of the accepted order in which case however they will be mistaken mr anderson has set out on a more daring expedition than a quest of plain or doubtful fact as he explains in a note  the word romance is used in the sense of a fictitious narrative in prose with imaginary conversations and fictitious incidents and not in the modern sense of a lovestory thus the title might be read  the story of sandro botticelli reconstructed from his paintings as it is the author has given us some very pretty romance and has told the story as his imagination pictured it of the events loves disappointments and triumphs of which the canvases stood as the centre as they became imbued little by little with life and colour but surely this practicehowever successful may be its results in the way of drama and popular interestis a dangerous one in this case the work is interspersed with some really invaluable criticisms and sidelights on those pictures from which the author has drawn his creative inspirations but the peril remains were this method to become common how many modern artists would go in fear and trembling lest some selfelected benefactor of the dim future should endeavour to reconstruct their lives from some specimen of their art once hung on the walls of the royal academy they would probably have reason for their dread but even this speaking generally does not justify this new departure in the way of romantic biography,biography

vassili verestchagin painter soldier tra teller autobiographical sketches 2 vols illustrated bentley  son mr f h peters has translated these sketches  from the german and the french a process which may partly account for the fragmentary character of two extremely readable and spirited volumes the sketches begin with the authors sixth year and conclude with reminiscences of the russoturkish war of 1877 madame yerestchagin occupies a large portion of the book with an accountwhich is most characteristic and cleverly written and by no means overcharged with admiration for the english  of her journey with her husband through india in the gentlemans narrative we have him as he sees himself while the lady supplies a picture which does not differ materially from her husbands portrait the artists love for colour and energetic motives which was manifest in the pictures he exhibited at the grosvenor gallery is displayed on every page travelling through central asia as an attache of general kaufmann m yerestchagin enjoyed peculiar privileges and he bears emphatic testimony to the decrease of slavery under the dominion of his countrymen not only in the territories they have annexed where slavery is forbidden and where the markets no longer exist but in the neighbouring states where the natives believe  not without reason that the russians may come any day and pay them a visit and mercilessly release the slaves as they always do wherever they go domestic castigation much affected by the natives is less rife than of yore the end of the world is coming cried our authors landlord with a gesture of despair  how so    why what else is one to expect when a husband may no longer correct his wife  if you beat her she threatens to go to the russians in fact the unpatriotic ladies appeal to caesar not often in vain they do not seem to be innocent of intrigues and gossipvices which according to the traveller are due to the degraded social state of creatures who are confined to merely animal functions and disfigured physically by the labour of a beast of burden in central asia the townswomen are worse off than in persia and turkey but the nomads are freer one of the most interesting and remarkable sections of this book is devoted to the public displays of dancing boys tamasha which occur at the feast of beiram it is too long for extract but will be found on pp 105110 of vol i the complex and comprehensive system of pauperism obtaining at tashkend in central asia is almost worthy of a subsidised irish parish the account of it is followed by notices of opiumeaters among the sarts not materially different from what we know the kirghiz falconers are a most picturesque set and they carry their birdsgolden eagles the text calls themhooded with leather and upon their hands they cast them off in the mediaeval fashion and use them to kill foxes hawks are employed in a similar manner how russia has crept upon china is shown in many passages of the book in none more clearly than the following the south tarbagotai detachment of 130 cossacks largely armed with flint muskets dating from the beginning of the century and two guns was in 1870 on the frontier near the little river bachty this frontier was very like what farmers in surrey and hampshire whose land abuts on common land felicitously call  a rolling fence the detachment was originally quartered in urdshar  whence it has moved gradually forward till it has reached its present station and has thus extended the russian frotier by about 100 versts between 1850 and 1860 many districts in the neighbourhood of urdshar still belonged to the chinese now they have not a single acre of land within a radius of 100 versts thus russia grows from day to day nay from hour to hour  but if it goes on growing like this adds m yerestchagin drily the consequences will be serious here is what our author saw of the results of the mohammedan rebellion against the chinese government in the region of tchugutchak   presently large clumps of trees were visible in the distance on both sides of the road marking the farms of which there were many round tchugutchak about two versts outside the town we baw several ruined houses and chapels the paintings on the walls were still uninjured some splendid old trees were still standing but quite dead for the irrigation canals are silted up and the soil is quite dry in the town similar sights meet the eye wonderful groves and avenues the work of years are sometimes completely destroyed or going to decay as you approach the town it is hard to believe it is empty  you cannot help hoping to meet some human being if it be only a robber but not a soul is to be seen anywhere the houses are for the most part uninjured and likewise the paintings on the walls and the wooden latticework of the windows potsherds and fragments of articles of every conceivable kind were lying all aboutvessels of iron and clay of all sizes a quantity of copper coins strung on a string dresses caps plaits of hair shoes of all sizes the clumsy bhoes of dunghans and calmucks side by side with the miniature slippers of chinese women 1 put a pair of extraordinarily small slippers in my pocket as a memento but above all skulls are to be seen lying about everywhere the town is like a vast tomb and the whole impression it produces is terrible i wandered about for a whole day in bs company and then for several days alone without being able to accustom myself to this stillness as of the grave and to the sight of all these streets chapels theatres and squares standing for ever empty the gate of the fortress which the besiegers had blown in is still tolerably strong near the gate is to be seen the entrance into the subterranean gallery by which the besiegers after a long and tedious siege made their way into the fortress then came a merciless butchery in which no one was spared skulls and bones lie literally in heaps against the walls here and all around the fortress at many points e g by several of the gates the skulls were piled up to a great height in the fields round the town too lie skulls  as far as the eye can reach skulls and skulls and again skulls the wolves and the jackals have already done their work  the ravens are still engaged in picking the bones clean for the sun and rain to bleach one of the farms in particular which lie nearest the town abounds in bones a body of calmucks fifteen thousand strong came this way to help the besieged  but a force of only a few hundred dunghans fell upon them drove them back and killed them to the very last man what wonderful energy on the part of the insurgent mohammedans what cowardice on the part of the chinamen  i had enough to occupy me from the governors palaoe to the simple little houses of the common people all the dwellings were habitable all were painted all decorated with paintings sculptures basreliefs flowers dragons 6c theatres of an original construction buddhist temples in which some colossal idols were still intact though the mohammedans evidently showed great zeal in overthrowing these and breaking them in pieces seemed almost to be waiting for the people to throng in to their prayers and their amusements for three whole weeks i lived with one cossack and one tartar in a wretched cabin outside the walls of the fortress and every day from morning till evening i roamed about looking at everything drawing and painting occasionally a wild goat would stray into the courtyard where i was painting stand transfixed with astonishment and then rush off at full speed across the steppe making ample allowance for m yerestchagins professional love of effect and his characteristic delight in strong local colours here is a pictureone of many in which this book aboundspainted in words by himself by quoting it we allow the author to illustrate himself his travels his taste and his literary art the picture supposing it to be wholly veracious is not more

newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening she would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  my goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  ay but i like the bite replied the creature the book is not purely highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown the future lady byron burnss bonnieleslie one of the cleverest women of her age mrs thrale catalani mrs siddons sir augustus deete the original we believe of harry richmonds father basil hall john clerk of eldin jeffrey canning the abbe sieves and many more emerge and disappear in connexion with prince augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty still after all we like the highland folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it the account of the old edinburgh society is entertaining she classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary she met all varietiesthe jeffreys sir david brewster  the crazy lord buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of queen marys and a bone of james the fifth harry erskine john clerk of eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and sir walter himself there is also a welldrawn portrait of canning whom she met in holland she is most fearless in confessing her opinions she confesses that she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  a coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the dukes arms at dunkeld to blair during the summer season the announcement read as follows pleasing intelligence the duchess of athol starts every morning from the  dukes arms at eight oclock the other is told of lord eldin  some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the west country celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument  wi an epitaph said john clerk in his broadest border dialect  he must hae an epitaph an appropriate epitaph an well change the exordium out o respect instead o the usual here lies well begin his epitaph wi here continues to lie,biography

1857commencing when byron had only begun to assert himself before keats had published and when shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny when wordsworth and coleridge

the nobilitys ballrooms are essentially the same beings as those young bucks old fogies and pretty flirts the natives of much inferior social circles higher up are better manners certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of english society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design perhaps mr thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern english aristocratic society his pictures most likely are not faultless whose are a line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation a man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation and now what is the nature of this fashionable world according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   vanity fair  pendennis  newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one the land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life mr thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that haut tonne is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of haut tonne can present us for the most part with such elements as these is the marquis of steyne a representative personage and his sister lady kew and the most noble farintosh is miss ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and lord kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman does love among these upper clwases usually signify flirtation and life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the world a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand marriage a convenient arrangement and religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like potichomanie and death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones self a still more disagreeable occurrenceare these the polite definitions l it would appear so perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes but do the middle get off any better rather worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of vanity fair than themselves a doleful and depressing view of human nature surely true we have mr pendenniss mother and lady walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have mr pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model i wife and worship him the colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of mr i thackerays creations we can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement with tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample of a young man handsome lively clever generous goodnaturednon ursiteris extra hle drinks his full share smokes immensely idles in the familiar rooms of warrington and mr pendennis and talks slang there and at the haunt where fred bavham and others have late beer and lobster likes sketching and does it semiprofessionally goes to baden and rome idles there and lets his beard grow falls in love with his cousin the beautiful flirt wishes himself a marquis or duke and hates those who are sulks over his fathers indulgence marries a plump scotch girl and her mother and becomes permanently disgusted with existence in his companion the youngpainter john james tidley mrthackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin the application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to truth with a smile or a wink to fashion in the same moment  praising pilgrim and faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in nuditty fair the chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 vol i p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us there is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in the newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as the kickleburys fur instance which the times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination,biography
the poetical work8 of edgar allans poe illus trated edinburgh alexander hislop and co it is one of the misfortunes attendant upon the absence of an international copyrightlaw between this country and america that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an american author in decent type and paper the reason is obvious the market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions that render such an effort much too risky hence it is that american literature whichwith all deference be it spokenshould not scorn adventitious aids is generally associated with dirty grey paper bad type small size and insecure binding let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read romeo juliet published in the form of a dirty tract which may be had in holywell street for twopence let him turn to his own large clear wellprinted edition and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace and light and sweetness that it did not possess before we are glad to perceive therefore that edgar allan poe unquestionably the greatest genius that america has yet producedis at length offered to english readers in a handy and presentable form with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper but it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems failure might have been anticipated at the beginning it was a priori as impossible to translate the dreamlike beauty of annabel lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano the illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e g one or two chaming little landscapes by mr macwhirter but to begin at the beginning did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than mr c j staniland has done with the  raven did mr staniland fancy that this was a comic poem  we find a hideously ugly boy seated in an annchair before a fire the room being filled with ghouls and spirits that remind us of the mnagic weene in der pieibchutz done iu a cuwtlty theatre what these tawdry devils have to do with the weird simplicity of the poem we are at a loss to make out but this is nothing to the final scneu in which the boy is found lying on the

best edition of poes poems we know of  the complete works of bret harte collected and revised by the author vol x tales of trail and town 6s chatto and windus the library edition of the works of bret harte is now complete in ten volumes the publishers have done their part well so far as binding and type are concerned though some readers may regret that none of the excellent illustrations which have adorned the earlier editions appear in the new one many reputations have been made and have passed since bret harte gave us the luck of roaring camp and hardly one has stood the test of constant production like his he is now what he was in his early days a writer of excellent stories with a sense of fine workmanship which he has never outraged the present volume contains tales that have already from a photo by john ruskin i886 bari aud proved their power of giving delight but mostly of a recent enough date to be still new to many readers  the poetical works of edgar allan poe with a notice of his life and genius by james hannay 1 esq with twenty illustrationssome of these twenty illustrations are gracefully fantastic the biographical notice is perversely sentimental the story of poes life was told by himself so largely and loudly to the public by the daily papers of america that to attempt to colour over its shames with sympathy and apology is idle the poems with their strange unwholesome unequal vigour nightmare verses if such things can be speak for themselves their writer apart from his works had best be forgotten  literature the works of edgar allan poe edited by john h ingram vols i and ii containing the collected tales london and edinburgh adam  charles black 1874 with jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although mr ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume i do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if i were just a little more mad than ever i waswe can say frankly this is what i am there is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  ligeiaas tothe expression of ligcias eyes he tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj though glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories they are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable if anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable circumstances  the gold bug  the descent into the maelstrom  the cask of amontillado  the oval portrait and the three stories about c auguste dnpin the philosophical detective if he should then desire to read more he may go on but warily there are trapdoors and springguns in these two volumes there are gins and pitfalls and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten one word on the services of mr ingram this edition has evidently been a labour of love with him let us hope in the next two volumes which are to complete the series he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of french which poe was so fond of scattering about his pages there are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under present considerationerrors i should like to make clear to mr ingram some fine evening over what he would call or suffer his printers to call vkflacon of glos de vougeot robert louis stevenson  the works of edgar allan poe 5 vols international

american ariters he is aloof sinister unbending while theyc are frank friendly companionable he belongs nowhere while t he v are local orat the broadestof their owns country and continent t h e

literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by the irony

a diplomatists wife in many lands 2 vols by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson  co animated and rather indiscreet these reminiscences should secure a wide public more especially as beneath their sparkle there lies much sound reflection mrs hugh fraser who is the daughter of a wellknown american sculptor a sister of the accomplished novelist marion crawford and the wife of an english diplomatist has enjoyed an unusual upbringing during a girlhood spent in italy she acquired an intimate acquaintance with society as it existed before the achievement of political unity and she remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order her arguments do not always carry persuasion but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion it had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority thus gregory xvi displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green turkish trousers whatever the rest of their costume might be and by swaddling the figures on the tomb of paul iii in casttin draperies painted to match the colour of the marble  officials if prince massimo can be taken as a type were not overscrupulous  he was for many years postmastergeneral and utilised hh facilities to make a valuable collection america was a long way off frcm rome at that time  and every letter that my people received from the united states had had the ste mps boldly cut out of the envelope before it was handed over to the postman we get a pretty picture of priestly discipline in the alban hills  the great preoccupation in the castelli as the mountain villages are called is to keep the girls out of harms way i have heard the preacher say to the women 4 never mind about the men they were mado of different stuff to you  they can be sometimes bad and sometimes good but you cannot a woman must be either an angel or a devil there is no place between for her  the good priest therefore used to make them work in the fields in twos and threes and he would count them at the entrance of the town when they returned to see that no girl was loitering alone mrs fraser does not pay compliments to those whom others would call the liberators of italyvictor emmanuel for instance farini and garibaldi but we do not understand why a mystery should be mode of  garibaldis englishman his name was john whitehead peard he was a member of a wellknown west country family and he died in 1880 mrs fraser is definite however about that staunch champion of the temporal power cardinal antonelli whom she draws with vigorous strokes  44 in appearance he was a typical south italian small in build darkskinned with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell nothing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them his face wes meant to be mobile but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour he was a rapidly fluent talker and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us the italian chapters in this book are on the whole the most interesting but mrs fraser seems to have a happy knack of making amusing acquaintances wherever she goes she sits opposite a benevolent old gentleman at an hotel dinner and he reveals himself as edward lear the author of the book of nonsense a firm believer in ghosts she has collected some gruesome stories about them  and it appears that julius hare so excelled as a narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away in the second volume we are trans ported to peking and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two dowager empresses of whom the first died during the boxer rebellion whereupon the second who had been trained for the purpose promptly took her place mrs frasers argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than fortyfive or fifty and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate be that as it may she illustrates the pride of the chinese by a significant story  after the looting of the palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the imperial family through the chinese ambassador take them away exclaimed the minister they are desecrated filthywe never want to see them again mrs fraser concludes with vienna from 1880 to 1882 she does not spare the court and some of her stories about the empress are a little unkind she writes of the unfortunate however in a chivalrous spirit notably of benedek the defeated at sadowa whom she considers to have been the victim of the incompetence of others and who went to the grave without an attempt to exculpate himself in taking leave of these agreeable volumes we may remark that it was sir henry wotton not sir thomas more who defined an ambassador as  an honest man sent to he abroad for the good of his country  p vii,biography

monthly review of literature domestic and foreign gaston de blndeille or the court of mharu iii keeping festival in ardxen a rolwe by mrs raddiffa 1826 in the memoir of mrs radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes there is so comprehensive and altogether so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy ite breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated departed spirits alas alas gaston de blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to the writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department now we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature the primary ones themselves i love hate ambition jealousy avarice have f their entrances and exits inthe breast but  c these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so i large a space in the basis of all characters c that they are usually and readily excitable ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production and a after even the

nobles knights ladies servants monks priests sentinels beset in all their paths by the importunate infernal who solicits as plain as gesture and unwearied perseverance can speak their aid in bringing a murderer to justice these worthy persons however one and all are far more afraid of the secular than the spiritual arm and not one of them has virtue or nerve to boldly help the demon in his persecution of a royal favourite the old plea of magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt afforded by the spectre here was a dilemma for the authoress and she found no escpefor like the egyptians of old whatever ghost did was supposed imitable by man but the end must come sooner or later

  the return of the native the return of the native by thomas hardy smith elder and co there are many indolent readers who when they open a novel like to plunge into a lively conversation or an exciting scene at once and lav down the book impatiently if their interest is not aroused on thc very first page to these mr hardys book will appear dull because they will not read far enough to be interested but persons of a more patient disposition will be well rewarded for thc task which we are compelled to admit is not quite an easy one of mastering the long descriptions of the groud bonthy furzy briary obsolete country in which the scenes of this story are laid wc j warn intending readers not to be alarmed at the verbose eccentricity which distinguishes its opening chapters nor to be repelled by the uncouth language often closely verging on coarseness in which the conversation of the natives of egdon heath is carried on the obvious imitations of victor hugo are confined to the opening chapters or at any rate reappear only at rare intervals throughout the work while the intimate acquaintance with and real affection for the suitoundings of his tale displayed by the author almost reconcile one to the repeated and prolonged emphasis with which he dwells on them the book is not crowded with characters as is too often the case in modern novels only three women mrs yeobright her niece thomasin and eustacia wye and three men wildeve young yeobright and the reddleman have anything to do with the development of the drama of course there are other characters but although some like christians are fresh well drawn and very amusing they play no part whatever and only serve to fill up the background the result of the skilful handling of these few persons is a concentration of interest steadily increasing tc wards the middle of the third volume after which unfortunately the sudden and unexpected removal of the two most interesting because most inexplicable actors leaves the stage blank and bare it is not usual for authors to kill off half their dramatis personce long before the book ends but from mr hardy we cannot expect anything usual on the contrary the originality and freshness of the work is such that these very qualities at first prevent our perceiving its full strength when after eleven months in london we first reach a remote alpine valley surrounded by weird rocks and cold glaciers the strangeness of our surroundings will for a few hours not allow us to enjoy their full beauty so it is with the  return of the native there is no heroine in it and nobody at all like anybody of whom we have read before nor is there as far as we can make out any hero one wedding takes place in the first volume another in the second and a third at the end of the book but the first two are not at all satisfactory and we suspect that no one will care much about the third the reddleman who acts throughout as the deus ex machind is apart from his redness which is inseparable from his business of selling dye the only character whom we think we have met before under the garb of a supernaturally intelligent amateur detective we do not propose spoiling the pleasure which attaches to the unknown and unexpected by betraying the plot but it may fairly be objected to the slender framework of the tale that if its conclusion had been pleasanter it would have lost none of its interest and would have been a great deal more satisfactory it appears to us that mr hardy had gradually become tired of working out the singular characters of eustacia and wildeve and not seeing how to get them out of the inevitable mess into which no unnatural events but their own innate weakness brought them had killed them off to get rid of the difficulty such an expedient if expedient it be is unworthy of the author and we are convinced that a little more patieuce would have been well bestowed on the third volume again clyni hardly betrays his tendencies with sufficient explicitness to permit us to feel that the course of life he at last adopts is quite natural notwithstanding our sympathy both with him and with his lofty aim we feel that he was made for something greater if not better and the interest the author arouses for thomasin is we believe much milder than he expected for it is evidently his wish that we should be satisfied with the quiet happiness she obtains while in reality we are perfectly indifferent to it eustacia is so obviously mr hardys favourite that she becomes ours also we are therefore disgusted with her misery in the second half of the novel and disappointed with her sad end notwithstanding these imperfections which are perhaps not faults but only idiosyncrasies of the author the book is one which deserves a better fate than merely to be skimmed and then thrown aside not only is it far very far above the ordinary three volume novel but and this is much higher praise many parts of it will bear reading a second time and will then be better appreciated than at the first hasty perusal the return of the native makes us expect very great things from mr hardy if he will only work slowly and patiently,biography
the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes

by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to us we have seen the silken courtiers to whom these people are as dogs bound by no ties of love among themselves the marquis bas left the reception room of monseigneur devoting him to the devil he has run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always the same with you people he cannot pay something   he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you   alas no monseigneur  but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass well  monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass again well she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition is that a morsel of stone or wood with my husband name may  be placed over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will  be quickly forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the  same malady i shall be laid undw some other heap of poor grass i monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much  want monseigneur monseigneur j the valet had put ber away from the door the carriage had broken n into a bruk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left fg far behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly  diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau i  distinctly present to the taney of the writer must have 11 g ly  been that scene of the taking of the bastille which is here is j made present to the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to the story of doctor manette as to the history of france here again is a little picture of saint antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sance to wretched bread  yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarges wineshop parted with its  last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door  at last it is come my dear f eh well returned madame  almost how admirable is the picture of the rise of power io the doctor when the day comes that makes the great horror of his life a means of blessing to his child by giving him influence as a bastille prisoner over the storm that threatens shipwreck of her dearest hopes he relapses when a second wave against which all bis skill is powerless breaks over her head aud the knot is at last solved by sydney cartou the exquisite poetry of the touches which detail to us j the manner of his sacrifice with the honour and trust  of an innocent girl to strengthen him in his last moment is worthy to be the close of a tale nobly sustained to the latest word a few touches here and there may be in excess  we are hardly content for example that it should occur to miss pros at a critical moment to compare madame defarge s eyes to bed winches  but these faults natural to au active fancy are very few and very slight in the work now before us lt is written throughout with an energy that never wanders from its aim a strength that uses with the

literature more leaves from the journal of a life in the highlands from 1862 to 1882 smith elder  co it is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be the twenty years with which the journal has to do was indeed an eventful period it was marked by such important incidents as thc francogerman and russoturkish wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves but with these matters the journal is altogether unconcerned it deals solely with the queens life in the highlands and though it is quite natural that her majestys subjects should wish to know what were the queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it it records no thrilling adventures a carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the journal offers to its readers the interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective we look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her as a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray though selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect an art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic and the special value of the queens journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour in these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects it is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the queen is so fond of scotland this book answers the question it is because there and especially in the highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity the queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of though house of stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors heredity asserts itself mr galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone for we arc insensibly reminded of king george iii farmer george when wo read the queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping but although the journal recounts the queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied but we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern the book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author charles j robinson

of the queens new j th hook its style is of the simplest and it al has the charm of naturalness which belongs  al to simplicity the story is told without effort  w or affectation of any kind and produces its j tc effect entirely by though force of sincerity her  q majesty is probably a sympathetic rather  s than an acute and dispassionate observer  a1 and everything that she sees is seen

experiences recorded are not altogether 1 such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character t the book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen it affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare but it is e its simple human interest that gives the  hook its strongest appeal the reader rises  from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learned something more of the good  i woman by whom it was writtenthat above all else he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be born by all to whom it comes how will the queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of st pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the queens consort had died at windsor this book contains the answer to that question its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope of the queens personal character the volume contains naturally enough many indications that character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will it was so in those early days of her sovereignty when lord melbourne told the queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could eve happily i for long without a mans arintb rest on and when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero this womanly trait is obviously a key to the queens intimacy with dr norman macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered though tribute of an i abundant gratitude a keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that principal campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of though statue of the prince consort at aberdeen when it rained in torrents in other places the manifest sincerity saves everything the book contains some few indications of the queens taste in literature we gather that she is a warm lover of scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the duchess of saxecoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell scotts stories  to prince albert and his brother the  queen herself appears to be familiar with scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j we are told that brown gave her a copy of the poems of the ettrick shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things it is said in various places that lady churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books this is to be regretted though anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure a similar silence is observed with respect to the queens tastes in the arts wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte that her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence it is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is though sole business of the book to present but while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the queen must have thought and written frequently the following passage on a visit to abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to abbotsford the wellknown residence of sir walter scott it lies low and looks rather gloomy mr hope scott and lady victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present duke of norfolk with their children the young duke of norfolk and some other relations received us mr hope scott married first miss lockhart the last surviving grandchild of sir walter scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of sir walter they showed us the part of the house in which sir walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his ms of ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx sir walter had himself collected then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of sir walter in the study we saw his journal in which mr hope scott asked me to write my name which i felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others we went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are sir walters last clothes we ended by going into the diningrcom in which sir walter scott died where we took tea in this connexion it may be mentioned that when the queens uncle and early guardian leopold king of the belgians travelled in scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the princess charlotte he was for a few days the guest of sir walter scott at abbotsford while there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way an aged scotch divine alluded to the fact that though king was descended from frederick the wise elector of saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the reformation and to become a protector of martin luther thereupon leopold said that he felt more honoured by though mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay the relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the queen herself says in these  leaves of the strong protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of scotland her majesty s love of the highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment that she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough above all things the queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to carlyle goethe was the first to say  come let us make a description it will be remembered that the passages of the queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her majestys visits to poor highland women there was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to though queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman the present volume contains two such peep into highland life and the one we quote fresents us with though last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow grant on sunday august 22 1869 i went to see old mn grant whom i was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and i fear dying of dropsy on august 20 i again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way i took her hand and held it on the 27th she died on the 28th i stopped at her cottage and went in with louise and leopold we found all so clean and tidy but all so silent mrs gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death she had on the socks i gave her the day before yesterday she was in her eightyninth year probably the most enjoyable of these  leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the highlands here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep at a quarter to twelve i drove off with louise and leopold in the waggonette up to near the  bush the residence of william brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep this is a practice pursued all over the highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man james brown my shepherd though elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then william and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry to the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tyre and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough a very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping it was a very curious and picturesque sight more pathetic is the following  tuesday june ll 1872  brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time i was dreadfully shocked it was the child of a man named rattray who lives at cairnnacraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper abercrombies house not far from monaltrie farmhouse in the street at a little before five set off in the waggonette with beatrice and janie ely and drove along the north side of the river we stopped a little way beyond tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest they were searching everywhere while we were there the ol grandmother catenach by name who lives at souttar hole came running along in a great state of distress she is rattrays mother we drove on a little way and then turned round we heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at monaltrie burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below mrs pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the dee this burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen the little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the dee and carried along too dreadful  it seems from what i heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one we drove back and up to mrs grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  wednesday june 12  drove up to the bush to warn mrs william brown never to let dear little albert run about alone or near to the burn of though danger of which she was quite aware she said her husband william had started off early at three this morning some people went down to abergeldie and as far as the girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle no word of the poor child being found all were to start early to search that the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the queens domestic life in truth her majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment so long ago as the year of the queens accession the marquis of londonderry writing to the duke of buckingham said i hear melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection thia fact her premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience that these  leaves contain much moro about mr john brown than about lord beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise the book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers naturally enough brown became essential to the queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy it is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of browns robust independence and simple usefulness we do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship,biography
vassili verestchagin painter soldier tra teller autobiographical sketches 2 vols illustrated bentley  son mr f h peters has translated these sketches  from the german and the french a process which may partly account for the fragmentary character of two extremely readable and spirited volumes the sketches begin with the authors sixth year and conclude with reminiscences of the russoturkish war of 1877 madame yerestchagin occupies a large portion of the book with an accountwhich is most characteristic and cleverly written and by no means overcharged with admiration for the english  of her journey with her husband through india in the gentlemans narrative we have him as he sees himself while the lady supplies a picture which does not differ materially from her husbands portrait the artists love for colour and energetic motives which was manifest in the pictures he exhibited at the grosvenor gallery is displayed on every page travelling through central asia as an attache of general kaufmann m yerestchagin enjoyed peculiar privileges and he bears emphatic testimony to the decrease of slavery under the dominion of his countrymen not only in the territories they have annexed where slavery is forbidden and where the markets no longer exist but in the neighbouring states where the natives believe  not without reason that the russians may come any day and pay them a visit and mercilessly release the slaves as they always do wherever they go domestic castigation much affected by the natives is less rife than of yore the end of the world is coming cried our authors landlord with a gesture of despair  how so    why what else is one to expect when a husband may no longer correct his wife  if you beat her she threatens to go to the russians in fact the unpatriotic ladies appeal to caesar not often in vain they do not seem to be innocent of intrigues and gossipvices which according to the traveller are due to the degraded social state of creatures who are confined to merely animal functions and disfigured physically by the labour of a beast of burden in central asia the townswomen are worse off than in persia and turkey but the nomads are freer one of the most interesting and remarkable sections of this book is devoted to the public displays of dancing boys tamasha which occur at the feast of beiram it is too long for extract but will be found on pp 105110 of vol i the complex and comprehensive system of pauperism obtaining at tashkend in central asia is almost worthy of a subsidised irish parish the account of it is followed by notices of opiumeaters among the sarts not materially different from what we know the kirghiz falconers are a most picturesque set and they carry their birdsgolden eagles the text calls themhooded with leather and upon their hands they cast them off in the mediaeval fashion and use them to kill foxes hawks are employed in a similar manner how russia has crept upon china is shown in many passages of the book in none more clearly than the following the south tarbagotai detachment of 130 cossacks largely armed with flint muskets dating from the beginning of the century and two guns was in 1870 on the frontier near the little river bachty this frontier was very like what farmers in surrey and hampshire whose land abuts on common land felicitously call  a rolling fence the detachment was originally quartered in urdshar  whence it has moved gradually forward till it has reached its present station and has thus extended the russian frotier by about 100 versts between 1850 and 1860 many districts in the neighbourhood of urdshar still belonged to the chinese now they have not a single acre of land within a radius of 100 versts thus russia grows from day to day nay from hour to hour  but if it goes on growing like this adds m yerestchagin drily the consequences will be serious here is what our author saw of the results of the mohammedan rebellion against the chinese government in the region of tchugutchak   presently large clumps of trees were visible in the distance on both sides of the road marking the farms of which there were many round tchugutchak about two versts outside the town we baw several ruined houses and chapels the paintings on the walls were still uninjured some splendid old trees were still standing but quite dead for the irrigation canals are silted up and the soil is quite dry in the town similar sights meet the eye wonderful groves and avenues the work of years are sometimes completely destroyed or going to decay as you approach the town it is hard to believe it is empty  you cannot help hoping to meet some human being if it be only a robber but not a soul is to be seen anywhere the houses are for the most part uninjured and likewise the paintings on the walls and the wooden latticework of the windows potsherds and fragments of articles of every conceivable kind were lying all aboutvessels of iron and clay of all sizes a quantity of copper coins strung on a string dresses caps plaits of hair shoes of all sizes the clumsy bhoes of dunghans and calmucks side by side with the miniature slippers of chinese women 1 put a pair of extraordinarily small slippers in my pocket as a memento but above all skulls are to be seen lying about everywhere the town is like a vast tomb and the whole impression it produces is terrible i wandered about for a whole day in bs company and then for several days alone without being able to accustom myself to this stillness as of the grave and to the sight of all these streets chapels theatres and squares standing for ever empty the gate of the fortress which the besiegers had blown in is still tolerably strong near the gate is to be seen the entrance into the subterranean gallery by which the besiegers after a long and tedious siege made their way into the fortress then came a merciless butchery in which no one was spared skulls and bones lie literally in heaps against the walls here and all around the fortress at many points e g by several of the gates the skulls were piled up to a great height in the fields round the town too lie skulls  as far as the eye can reach skulls and skulls and again skulls the wolves and the jackals have already done their work  the ravens are still engaged in picking the bones clean for the sun and rain to bleach one of the farms in particular which lie nearest the town abounds in bones a body of calmucks fifteen thousand strong came this way to help the besieged  but a force of only a few hundred dunghans fell upon them drove them back and killed them to the very last man what wonderful energy on the part of the insurgent mohammedans what cowardice on the part of the chinamen  i had enough to occupy me from the governors palaoe to the simple little houses of the common people all the dwellings were habitable all were painted all decorated with paintings sculptures basreliefs flowers dragons 6c theatres of an original construction buddhist temples in which some colossal idols were still intact though the mohammedans evidently showed great zeal in overthrowing these and breaking them in pieces seemed almost to be waiting for the people to throng in to their prayers and their amusements for three whole weeks i lived with one cossack and one tartar in a wretched cabin outside the walls of the fortress and every day from morning

litetature daniel deronda daniel deronda by george eliot london w blackwood and sons we know not which to admire most in  daniel deronda the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as gwendolen and daniel deronda or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at derondas wedding feast  the entire cohen family with the one exception of though baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home in none of george eliots novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present one cannot lay down though last volume of  daniel deronda without some tribute of astonishment at though vast range of the authors powers it is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of english societya great work of course in either view on the whole perhaps ones impression is that in  daniel deronda george eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place and a novelist in the second the purely pictorial purpose in this as in others of her novels is subordinate to the ethical in  daniel deronda strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist the dominant motive as revealed in the last volume of the work is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time in its last pages instead of an invitation to esthetic or humorous reverie we seem to find a trumpetcall to young men and maidensto young men to take example by the noble gravity of daniel deronda and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of gwendolen harleth and its tragic consequences a protest against low sordid personal aims an incentive to a higher worthier more aspiring and humane life such would seem to be the ruling intention of daniel deronda wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are which may satisfy though flaunting gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities the earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of though elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes and the full earnestness of the authors purpose was not certain till the very last and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind this says much for though success with which george eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should as a whole point somewhere teach some lesson have some aspiration towards the infinite all through the skilful dissection of gwendolens heartlessness which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon we feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology by a most skilful professor of the social microscope this creature a product of the generation is dissected before us and put piece by piece under the glass wo look on peep in our turn through the instrument and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure professor eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments but having completed her pathological lecture she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature an undeveloped organ  note this i will return to it another time in though course of though exposition we have become deeply interested in this organ and byandby our curiosity is gratified we aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system it seems as if george eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of casaubon and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of gwendolen and mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and lightheaded conceit and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm there must be hundreds of girls more or less like gwendolen among george eliots readers and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies perhaps if george eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint she ought to have increased gwendolens punishment for after all gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles being left with two thousand ayear and a developed conscience and free to marry if she chooses a hearty handsome young cousin whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days but then gwendolens crime after all was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened and her wicked husband is drowned if grandcourt had turned np again or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning but it would have been too miserable besides that if sho had been left in physical misery we could not have had though same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration if gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period daniel deronda is equally an example to the young man of though period in the gravity and loftiness of his aims our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig and would jeer at his relations with gwendolen as impossible  and their judgement of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race his grave meditative nature his profound composure and selfcontrol his steady persistent passion are eminently hebraic and are meant to be so he is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin it is an influence too to which in our earnest moments we are not incapable of yielding ourselves and with the healthiest of results there is a something in it also which is repellent to the average common sense of englishmen that something is well expressed by sir hugo mullinger an admirably drawn type of the cultivated english squire i have long expected something remarkable from you dan  but for gods sake dont go into any eccentricities i can tolerate any mans difference of opinion hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic at this stago of though world if a man wants to be tikn seriously ho must keep clear of melodrama dont misunderstand mo i am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account i only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic especially if he wanted defending you have a passion for people who arc pelted dan im sorry for them too but so far as company goes its a kid ground of selection still sir hugo does not quarrel with daniel deronda for his innacy ho respects his earnestness and here again he is typical of his countrymen by far the most wonderful part of  daniel deronda its chief claim to admiration as an achievement is its picture of the jews its exemplification and analysis of different forms of jewish life some of them not so estimable as deronda and mordecai we have spoken of the cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work in the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of lapidoth mirahs father who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some musiclessons ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat  thc look of impudent suavity the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the hebrew race the interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond who has something of the character of charles mathewss awful dad and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated is very finely conceived there are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making lapidoths impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his sons stern rebuke  or who having done so would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek the humour of lapidoths subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to mordecai and deronda and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry is exquisite george eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly among the minor characters in  daniel deronda  there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is lapidoth when we think of all that there is in daniel deronda we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist still wthen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art we must admit that it has deficiencies it is a subepidermic subcutaneous kind of art the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology it is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness and that dullness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment the novel is not a work of art pure and simple but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts there is a want of courage in george eliot she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves she must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing what principles of their nature they are illustrating she is too professorial too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him nevertheless she is a great writer a great genius and if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum total  literature daniel deronda by george eliot edin burgh and london w blackwood  sons 187g independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections daniel deronda is eminently interesting because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light though merits as well as the faults of its writer merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated and are not as is too frequently the case blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of english letters on the one hand we are prepared to find and we do find an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character  a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade attitudes transient moods of mind complex feelings and the like which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer  an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims and a wonderful sympathy with humanity so far at least as it is congenial to the writer on the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and onesided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent to this black list must be added some decided faults in style in discussing a book which is in everybodys hands it will be well to show how the above points are brought out and how they affect the general merit of the book rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot in the matter of character then wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture the part of gwendolen harleth is throughout an overwhelming success and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch her selfwilled youth the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character which her selfconfidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her her instant surrender at though touch of material discomfort  the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit the helpless outbursts of selfpity of rage of supplication which follow that collapse  the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience  the torrent of remorse and final prostration of willare all imagined with a firmness and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence which cannot but command admiration the husband is almost equally admirable  indeed ones admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly and that the author would like ns to detest grandcourt yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait as he appears before us acting with strict politeness to his wife in no way violent towards ber if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language and employing for the purposes of his refined tyranny nothing stronger than the methods of  awful rule and right supremacy if he should appear to anyone all the more detestable it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival the more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them and an additional interest is impaitcd by the discovery that gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of dorothea animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy it might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that though soul of casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as grandcourt but these nro fancies the point of present importance is that though interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so of the third according to though authors design the first personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken the blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coatcollar continually who at the age of some twenty years wished  to get rid of a merely english attitude in studies  who in the words of his best friend was disposed  to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium   of whom it was impossible to believe in the still more graphic words of the friends sister  that he had a tailors bill and used boothooks who never does a wicked thing and never says one that is not priggishis a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike but refuse to admit him as possible only once perhaps is he humanwhen he persuades himself on all sorts of ethicophysicohistorical grounds that he should like to be a jew solely becauso as that very sensible woman his mother the princess discovers at once he wishes to marry a fascinating jewess we cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this  faultless monster  as hero though pleas put forward in the book that it is only though  average man  and the  dull man  that will not understand him and that the average man is not very clear about though structure of his own retina and the dull mans  dullness subsists notwithstanding his lack of belief in it in the first place the cases are not parallel for though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough and in the second place though dull man may fairly retort  if you are a great novelist make me believe in your characters in this dearth or rather distortion of central interest the minor characters do not help us much they are far less individual and far less elaborate than is usual with george eliot daniel deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of mdmes holt and cadwalladcr poy ser and glegg sir hugo mullinger with hans meyrick and his sister mab makes a shift to fill up the gap but it is but a shift lapidoth the unwelcome father is chiefly welcome to us the readers because ol the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers mordecai we must not we suppose call a minor character but of him more hereafter there is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which george eliot has accustomed us though account of gwendolens grounds of confidence  the charming etching of though wagon passing pennieote keeto ry the scene of thc first ride with grandcourt gwendolen nfl cr klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover the wonderful sketch of grandcourt sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature deronda in the synagogue the stables at the abbey  thc waiting at genoa for the princess  and lastly gwendolens retrospect of ofleiulonc are all effects ofthe finest in this kind but this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed as it seems t o us in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in themselves and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged might have freer play no one can read daniel de rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that though author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed we cannot away in a novel with emotive memory and dynamic quality with  hymning of cancerous vices  and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss with  coercive types  and  spiritual perpetuation still less with hundreds ol phrases less notable because bulkier xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough and they are all more or less intelligible to decentlyeducated people no doubt though truths of science mental and physical are here as elsewhere in our authors works rendered with astonishing correctness and facility but it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate in philosophy in politics in religion in art a novelist when he speaks in his own person should have no opinion should be of no sect should indulge in no argot if we are dissatisfied with though jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition we do not in the slightest degree feel  imperfect sympathy with jews and we hold that shylock had the best of the argument but the question here is whether the phase of judaism now exhibited the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle we think that it has not and we are not to be converted by references to the average man the average man has never experienced the passion of hamlet of othello or of lear he is not capable of the chivalry of esmond of the devotion of des grieux of the charity of the vicar of wakefield but he has experienced and he is capable of something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms now the  samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine to borrow a phrase from allon locke into which mordecai initiates deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human they aro not only  willworship but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling poetry could legitimately treat them indeed many of mordecais traits may be recognised as we think moro happily placedin though sephardo of the spanish gypsy they are no doubt interesting historically they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph but for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest of prose novels should be wrought it is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with though manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of mordecai probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic if though thing was to be done it could hardly have been done better assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive we should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion which characterise the subjects and situations of the authors earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present it is a timehonoured transition and one which has before now yielded excellent results but in reality the transition is not in this case great because the subjectmatter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment the book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of george eliots work which lurks even in the scenes of clerical life which is hardly in abeyance in adam bede which is though professed motive of the mill on the floss of the spanish gypsy and of romola which gives charm to the slightness of silas mar uer  to wit the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty hither than the op posing instinct all for love and the world well lost perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application but this is matter of opinion the matter of fact remains that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between gwendolens misery and the prosperity of the sleek deronda the same moral as we had in hettys catastrophe in the fate which punished maggie tullivers partial declension from the standard in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from duke silvas passion in the degradation and death of tito melema though same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of felix holt for a hero and of dorothea brook for a heroine the moral and the standard and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity and deal deserved rebuke to though lax pleasureseeking which has been considered a vice at all times and is not openly considered a virtue even yet in though illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits and much exquisitelydrawn surrounding but perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the immutable law that no perfect novel can ever be written in designed illustration of a theory whether moral or immoral and that art like atticus and the turk will bear no rival near the throne george

fiction the exquisite perdita by e barrington harrap 7s 6d if anyone thinks that the historical novel is dead a perusal of the works of the lady who writes under the name of  e barrington should undeceive him the author of these romances has a rare power of visualising the past combined with a decided talent for dialogue and command of literary expression though she may perhaps be charged with looking at life very largely from the standpoint of her own sex she does not make the mistake of so many clever women in treating the man as a mere foil for the portrayal of female activities and excellences in her latest book a masterly study of sentimentality the readers interest will be almost equally divided between the actress who became the first mistress of george iv as prince of wales and sheridan who are represented as half in love with one another some of the best work is in the earlier chapters where the brilliant dramatist and drury lane proprietor is shown cajoling garrick to prepare perdita for a stage career and shielding her from the advances of wouldbe admirers whilst combating his own inclinations skilful use is made of the personality of his adorable wife reynoldss st cecilia in warding off undesirable complications and the latters own pathetic situation affords an effective underplot the sordid worthlessness which was hidden under the showy splendours of the prince who wooed the young actress as  florizel is relentlessly brought out and the exposure though couched under the form of fiction is more sound historically than recent attempts to whitewash him by pseudobiography some of the later episodes of the book though remarkable as tours de force notably the scene between perdita and the duke and duchess of cumberland the real villains of the piece are scarcely so convincing and the relations here depicted of the discarded mistress with charles james fox cannot be pronounced more than plausibly credible though some colour may be lent to them by the popular belief the curious in biographic fiction may contrast with the treatment of the perdita episode the equally remarkable study on the same theme by the late stanley makower if they can obtain it g le g n,biography
sense and sensibility by jank ai sten richard bentley new burlington street this reprint of miss fane austens excellent work forms no xxiii of the standard novels the best critique of the work itself will be found in thc wellwritten preface but as we wish all to read that anti the novel too that read our notice we shall make a few brief but sincere remarks of high praise upon the publication before us this novel we have always held to be one of the best if not the very best of its class chaste yet witty it can boast of excessive purity without tininess turns morality into loveliness anti proves religion to be the very highest state of mortal enjoyment this work is the voice of innocencelow vet beautifully distinct from its excessive sweetness anti so persuasive that we feel assured it can come only from the seclusion where vice has never dared to enter and where it fails to make a proselyte it must fall upon a heart unwin thy to enjoy what is beautiful anti unable to appreciate what is virtuous  the literary examiner sense and snsibility by miss austen standard novels vol xniii bentley there we few works of fiction so acceptable in republication as the novels of miss austen they never weary their interest is sever lost for as in the prints of hogarth we find fresh matter for admiration upon every renewal of our acquaintance her fables ore of the simplest construction her incidents in the common course of things and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation the story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases there are no exaggerations and no deficiencies and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fullness of the effect is produced the persons described are such as we meet every day in society but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of actionthe one illustrating the otherand moreover most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates self is a great disturber of the observing faculties in miss austens novels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world and free from the engrossment of acting a part in it we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked the commonplace characters of the town and the village are the characters which miss austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood in the story before us what an example of the worthless is mr johii dashwoodnot the wormhless in the common acceptation of the word implying positive vice but the worthless negative of worth of which common character miss austen has evinced a perfect comprehension and presented various illustrations mr john dashwood is incapable of a generous sentiment or a benevolent action but he is a rigid olserver of all the laws of the world and we know full well that so really despicable a man would pass as a very pattern of proprietya model man he has a wife all selfishness and worldliness who draws the pale of humanity round her own house to whom he looks up as he must to some one being of a parasitical genus with veneration consecrating all her foibles and almirilngly magnifying her littleness for one traitthe brother of this paragon marries beneath him as the world calls it though in this as in many other cases so described the match was an equal one for two narrow souls were attracted by the sympathy of meanness and literally contracted to each other the feelings of mrs john dashwood upon this trying occasion are described as follows by the adoring husbandwe think we hear the man speakas we read the letter and the very breaks are full of nature and denote the emphasis of his selfish concern your sister has suffered dreadfullyin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome poor fanny mrs john dashwood she was in hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much donovan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution elual to any thing she has born it all with the fortitude of an angel she says she never shall think well of any body again anl one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived csense and sensibility p 228 how exquisitely true to the sort of nature described is that unconscious satire  she has born it all unit the fortitude of an angel  she says she never shall think well of

testament who make slaves of expectation and torment with fears of disappointment and cause the interested hopes of their death to be fraught with miseries and abasements during their lives her merit considered her perfection in one style miss austen is the worst appreciated novelist of her time she laboured under the disadvantage of ihaving the inferior stamp of circulatinglibrary popularity put upon her works before the superior judges had become acquainted with them and recognised their high degree of excellence the quarterly review to its honour be it remembered was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius it is remarkable that scott who noticed with praise many inferior authors never mentioned miss austen perhaps because she was not an inferior author perhaps for the same reason that caused sir walter to consider fieldings incomparable satire jonathan wild only as a story the

the countess cosel a romance of history of i the times of augustus the strong by joseph j kraszewski translated and edited by count s c de soissons downey  coof the 312 works chiefly novels produced by the polish writer kraszewski we believe  the jew is the only one which up to this time has been translated into english the present story however has enjoyed great popularity among the authors countrymen and it has been translated into both french and german perhaps the best thing which kraszewski has left is his story of jermola the potter which first appeared in 1857 anticipating by four years  silas marner which it greatly resembles this was an extraordinary coincidence for it is certain that the english author was unacquainted with the writing of her polish contemporary of the present work we may say that it is lively and carries the reader along with it the portraits of augustus ii and his great rival charles xii are vigorous and their supposed meeting at dresden is dramatically conceived  but the polish king is such a thorough scoundrel that we cannot make a hero of him we grow tired of him and his female favourites and are sorry that the countess cosel as she was called should have fallen under his influence the picture of the orgies of her drunken husband with augustus and his revellers is repulsive she is divorced only to fall into greater misery after a brief triumph and ends her days in prison the poor pole zaklika who loses his life for her is an interesting figure the book is illustrated with portraits and deals with an epoch which is not very familiar to the english reader who probably does not know much about augustus the strong and his skill in twisting horseshoes and bending iron bars as the one preserved in the museum of st petersburg testifies it must be confessed that kraszewski had a great deal of skill in storytelling he was a clever man all round and has left some good poetry perhaps we may remind our readers that by order of the german government he was arrested at dresden on a frivolous charge of treason and detained for some time in the fortress of magdeburg he died at geneva march 19th 1887,biography

oorr the teaps by the author of  the i autocrat of the breakfasttable sampson low dr holmes in the mansions of british aristocrats felt himself  at home but his truest admirers preferred to meet him at the famous breakfasttable these will now gladly welcome him again  over the teacups where lie discourses genially and wisely of men ard manners it is unnecessary to draw comparisons between his present conversations and those which some thirty years ago made him famous that he  feels he has something he would like to say  is his sufficient justification for the present work and there are plenty of people on both sides of the atlantic who will listen to him gladly we may however note in passing that the always genial doctor is now if possible more genial than ever even his old friend the new england deacon is not held up to ridicule among the characters that assemble around the teatable are two of our old familiar friends the autocrat himselfnow known as the  dictator though he dictates very little and indeed takes ostensibly only a small part of the conversationand the professor all the rest of the old company have departed and given place to new and not uninteresting guests among these is of course a doctor who is one of the parties in the slight loveromance that runs through the book that much of the talk relates to old age is natural enough seeing that the author has now completed his eightyone years and is not anxious to conceal the fact he seems to regard himself at this stage of life with something of the curious scientific or semiscientific interest which hitherto he has always manifested with reference to external things he studies his sensations and notes the gain and the lossbeing quite alive to the privileges as well as to the imonveniences connected with his time of life ie is of opinion that 4 old age is infinitely more cheerful for intelli gent people at least than it was two or three thousand years ago it is our duty so far as we can to keep it so there will always be enough about it that is solemn and more than enough alas that is saddening but how much there is in our times to lighten its burdens  if they that look out at the windows be darkened the optician is happy to supply them with eyeglasses for use before the public and spectacles for their hours of privacy if the grinders cease because they are few they can be made many again by a third dentition which brings no toothache in the train by temperance and good habits of life proper clothing wellwarmed welldrained and wellventilated dwellings and sufficient but not too much exercise the old man of our time may keep his muscular strength in very good condition dr holmes is by no means an enthusiastic admirer of 1the good old times le believes in the things and the men of today if the match were possible he says he would be prepared to back mr gladstone for a hundred shekels against caleb that overconfident old israelite to cut down and chop up a cedar of lebanon about many other topics which interest him dr holmes takes the present opportunity of discoursing he is somewhat severe on the persons he styles braintappers those literary operatives who address persons whose names are well known to the public asking their opinions or their experiences on subjects which are at the time of general interest the object with which the braintapper puts his questions may lie admits be a purely benevolent and entirely disinterested one but this is not always the case in many instances the braintapper  is acting much as those persons do who stop a physician in the street to talk with him about their livers or stomachs or other internal arrangements instead of going to his office and consulting him expecting to pay for his advice others are more like those busy women who having the generous intention of making a handsome present to their pastor at as little expense as may be send to all their neighbours and acquaintances for scraps of various materials out of which the imposing bedspread or counterpane is to be elaborated akin to the braintapper  is the writer of unnecessary communications who desires to express admiration or to seek information or to procure an autograph dr holmes confesses he has encouraged this vice he was willing to answer all correspondents as long as he was able but at length it became necessary to give notice that the letters books and pamphlets which reached him were too numerous to be attended to if he undertook to read and answer them all he would have little time for anything else it is gratifying to receive them no doubt when large numbers of strangers insist on claiming one as a friend on the strength of what he has written it tends to make him think of himself somewhat indulgently dr holmes hints at the difference that exists between the written and the unwritten answers to correspondents and remarks that 1the hypocrisy of kindhearted people is one of the most painful exhibitions of human weakness he gives a few specimens of the unwritten answers of which one may be quoted by way of example think the lines you mention are by far the best i ever wrote hey well i didnt write those lines what is more i think they are as detestable a string of rhymes as i could wish my worst enemy had written dr holmes concludes his present series of papers with the hope that he may yet meet his readers  in the now and then of the future we hope so too for many years to come lie has given us his views about old age and the world in general from the standpoint of eighty years we shall hope in due time to learn how he regards them at ninety wvalter lewin,biography

holmes i holds a high place in the light literature of  america he is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists there is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what mrs j da pringle in gaits  ayrshire legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent with all this the story of iris approves dr holmes to be an american writerthe number of mysterious girls who figure in

him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that i shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way i followed him to his habitat being

john bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean

feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies

certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive a kentucky editor

young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of utah are her women it is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources the last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers  the poet of the breakfast table saturday november 2 1872 literature by oliver wendell holmes routledge  sons we have had the autocrat and the professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour we cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded it would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the poet like the autocrat and professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly the breakfasttable series is now complete its fault is its extreme length the poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse if he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as pas trop de zele the poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue there are fourteen persons at the breakfast table the opposite ends are occupied by the landlady and the capitalist on one side are the poet the scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a man of letters a master of arts a young girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called scheherazade and the lady on the other side are dr b franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the astronomer the member of the haouse as the legislator calls himself the registrarof deeds the salesman and that boy the lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community he turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary in this company the poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures they are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries the poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match the following are among very numerous examples  it aint just the thing to grease your ex with the isle of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do again   it is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle cotton mather was miserable all his days i am afraid after that entry in his diary  this day dr sewele was chosen president for his piety1 we may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal americans believe that there are no hs in england and frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  however we could match the goodlooking landlady of the poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope the daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the order of things and who remarks  i hope to do some sound thinking in heavenif i ever get there  fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects the first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted they have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from heaven the groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem we approve of the old masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed i dont like your chopped music any way that woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesflorence nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowiez out isnt not that exactly but something like it i have been to hear some music pounding after describing the concert with much humour he adds i like to hear a woman sing and i like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me i know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and pop went a small piece of artillery    that boy was in his seat looking demure enough the master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which i saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our great organthat himalayan home of harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often there is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  i thank god that a great many people believe a great deal more than i do i think when it comes to serious matters i like those who believe more than i do better than those who believe less there is no doubt that this is a general feeling we endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   it is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it if he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone in quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the breakfast table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids the character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the young girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the weekly bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it the poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul she ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail i spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night the poet thinks the toiling scheherazade of the weekly bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers the sunworshippers daughter which she wrote for the bucket here is a sample  kiss mine eyelids beauteous morn blushing into life newborn  lend me violets for my hair and thy russet robe to wear and thy ring of rosiest hue set in drops of diamond dew  kiss my lips thou lord of light kips my lips a soft good night westward sinks thy golden car  leave me but the evening star and my solace

maru lyndon or revelations of a life an autobiography new york strange  towns i end london low  co  this is a story written by a woman as a protest against the social grievances of which as she conceives women have an especial cause of  complaintthese are the legal tyranny of husbands and the difficulty for a woman to obtain  cheap and easy divorce this being the text i it is not difficult to imagine that the authoress  makes out a strong case of special pleading j mary lyndon the heroine is a strongminded womanmany many degrees above proof  she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment  a susceptible female but out of them all  she comes forth triumphantly an  emanci pated woman offering herself as an example  and a leader to her sex for our own part we  must confess that upon closing the book we had j come round to the verdict of the sagacious old1 ham jury on the trial of a man for killing his  j wife that he had served her right most   readers will we fancy feel unfeigned compas sion for mr albert hervey who for some sin  in a previous state of existence is sentenced to become the husband of mary lyndon the authoress is not without talent but she chokes i  all sympathy in her readers by the hard arro  gant dogmatical selfcomplacency with which   she puts herself forward the book is written   in the worst style of american bad tastefull   of pedantry and fine writing the story is one j that simply told and written in a better spirit p might have been made not only interesting but profitable for it touches upon many deeply  j interesting points in the secret and social life of women but as it stands it is only redeemed from being absurd by being detestable the heroine begins with her early childhood and goes through all the miseries that can beset a child for the purpose of shoving how ignorant foolish and bigoted were all the people placed in authority over her they treat her wrong they feed her wrongthey clothe her wrong they teach her wrongand she has to find herself in every thing in fact from her own account of herself she seems to have been sent into the world like a bottle of patent medicine labelled and attested to cure every imaginable female complaint social or physical dissatisfied with the religious teaching she receives from her parents she becomes a quaker and going to visit some quaker friends she receives an offer from a man to whom she conceives a violent antipathy at first sight and accepts him her account of the matter is that  his friends pleaded and besought her to marry him and m  a whirl of persuasions that literally made me dizzy i consentedmy time was well nigh come when fate met me in the path of life and i fell on my face and worshipped a young man such as i had seen in my daydreams was introduced to me by hervey i lovedand i awoke to the consciousness of living death the hours i spent with my friend whose sphere was a constant beneficence to me were whitewinged moments such as make our ideal of heaven my heart sprang to him as the flower lifts its petals to the warm sunlight in spite of this she keeps her engagement and marries herveyand  does her duty by him in a style that would make any husbands blood curdle in his veins at the prospect of what might have been his lot had the gods given him such a wife she of course as a pendant to her own portrait as a model wife and victim paints her husband in conjugal colours that rival the superfluous blackness of an illustrious personage who must not be named to ears polite after a while she separates from him gives lectures at a lyceum and takes up a highly platonic attachment to an exquisite transcendentalist  with a face fair and beautiful as a babes his complexion was the rose and lily shining through a skin that was the transparent medium of hereditary scrofulahe stood radiant as the rose and pearl of a seashellthe blessed moon raining her silver sheen on his waving and golden

of the female sex and takes a regular degree as a homoeopathic physician practising the watercure also by which she obtains at length money fame and strangely enough respectability she blooms out also into a celebrated authoress and discovers in a highly distinguished editor the ideal husband who would be necessary to the completion of her moral being and after the interchange of more than a hundred pages of love letters which are all given at full length finally she resolves to obtain a divorce if she can from her husband and if she cannot to live with the man of her choice as his wife without the legal sanction however to save the punctuaties as the chinese call them the original husband applies for a divorce and she telling mr vincent that if her love should ever lead her from him she must go and making a few other stipulations consents to appoint a day for the ceremonyand the book concludes amid the same profusion of fine words and selfcomplacent arrogance which prevail in the

is a painful book to read but it is also impossible to do so without being benefited by the perusal mary barton a tab oat m chester life in 2 vols chapman and hall every scene is indeed a touch of nature almost sanctified by its wholesome truthfulness the meeting of the friends in  green heys fields the earnest selfwilled john barton the future chartist an intellect struggling against poverty

factory in which jeni wilson saves so many lives at the peril of his own and gllantry will not be denied to rude coarse men akin to that of any knights most glorious deeds a teaparty of the poor pleasantly sketched is followed by a scene full of pathos the sudden death of mrs barton one of the ties which bound john barton to the gentle humanities of earth being thus loosened he became more obstinate in his aversion to the rich and his gloom and his sternness became habitual the authoress professes to have nothing to do with political economy or the theories of trade she says that she merely wishes to impress what the workman feels and thinks but she allows the discontented to murmur in prolonged strains without an attempt to chasten the heart or to correct the understanding barton rails at all capitalists as being so only through the toil of the poor this would be staunch communism there surely must be capitalists or the condition of the poor would be worse than ever we are told in scripture that the poor shall never cease out of the land but we are also told that their expectation shall not perish and that those who trust shall be fed and be delivered out of affliction further than this we are told that the person of the poor should no more be respected than that of the rich should be honoured and while it is sinful to oppress and a duty to assist so also to the poor that will not hear rebuke their poverty is their destruction while the father gets more and more involved in chartist plots mary engages herself as an apprentice to a milliner in a little street leading off ardwick green and where she is seen and admired by harry carson son of the opulent millowner the interest of the rivalry of the workingengineer and the young gentleman is however for a time absorbed by passing scenes descriptive of the sore afflictions of the poor the cellar to which barton and wilson repair to carry comfort to a starving familythree or four little children rolling on the damp nay wet brick floor through which the stagnant filthy moisture of the street oozed up the fireplace empty and black the husband dying of typhus the wife crying in the dark loneliness of

loses both lovers at the same time she is the more confirmed in her resolve in respect to henry carson as he intimated that his intentions had not at first been of an honourable character the pith of the story hangs upon the events which follow upon the dismissal of the two lovers the fallen esther warns jem wilson that a fate similar to hers awaits mary and in an attempt to prevent this the workman assaults his young master not long after this john barton worked up to madness by his false notions of the relation of master and workman shoots henry carson with jem wilsons gun the young engineer is tried and only saved by an alibi the manner in which mary barton declares her preference for the prisoner then at the bar is a most effective scene the old man acknowledges his guilt to

the legend of jubal and other poems saturday may 16 7874 literature george eliot s poems by george eliot blackwood  sons there are certain developments of the genius of george eliot for which verse is the only satisfactory medium artistic longings and fancies such as abound in romola and  middlemarch can scarcely find adequate expression in prose in the march of verse and in the effect of recurrent sounds there is something which aids as much the writer in the development of his thought as the reader in its appreciation or retention not seldom the continued labour of the author imparts to his work a grace and a significance beyond his expectation that come upon him almost as a surprise and a revelation where no such result is obtained there is a pleasure in the task of polishing to the utmost poetic utterances which combines the glad service of the worshipper with the mothers delight in attendance upon her offspring since the success of the spanish gypsy bas shown that verse in the hands of george eliot is a serviceable and manageable instrument there is little cause to wonder it is again adopted the poems in the volume now published deal with that aspiration which takes in different natures the form of music devotion love for such themes poetry is the fittest medium in welcoming george eliot once more as a poet however and in expressing sympathy and admiration for her present production we are far from implying that we should like to see a large portion of her effort directed to verse her case is analogous to that of scott no one will now contest the value of scotts ballad romances while however in his own days scott had in poetry rivals and superiors in prose fiction his supremacy was unchallenged in like manner the appearance of a poem from george eliot is a matter of interest while that of a novel is an affair of highest literary importance the four principal poems in the volume have already appeared in print in various magazines english and american all have a measure of resemblance in the lesson they enforce in the legend of jubal and in armgart aspiration developes itself through music in agatha it finds its utterance in a life of devotion and in  how lisa loved the king it blossoms into love after his departure from the presence of his offended god cain built a city in which his offspring dwelt unaware of the curse of death that was upon them idly they laboured as a maid who weaves her hair ia mimic mats and pauses oft aud strokes across her hand her tresses soft then peeps to watch the poised butterfly or little burdened ants that homeward hie time was but leisure to their lingering thought there was no need for haste to finish aught accident first revealed the presence in their midst of the grim spectre of death and a change came over the scene each man feeling the insecurity of his tenure now that death was lord of life strove to snatch te passing hour and work grew eager and device was born chief workers among those stung into activity were the sons of lamech in whose family death had made first inroad jabal the eldest son learned to tame the lowing kine to nurse the starbrowed calves and soothe the silly sheep tubal yoked the fire and made it roar in prisoned servitude within the furnace till with force subdued it changed all forms he willed to work upon meanwhile listening to the clanging symphonies of the beaten and resonant metal jubal heard some melody wherein dumb longings inward speech bad found long he brooded over the sweet and mingled sounds the fluctuant changes of the spoken word  the mothers call the childrens answering cry the laughs light cataract tumbling from on high the suasive repetitions jabal taught that timid browsing cattle homeward brought the clearwinged fugue of echoes vanishing and through them all the hammers rhythmic ring the result of his meditations was the birth of the lyre alone among the hills he practised until his hand obtained a mastery over the chords at length one holidaytide he ventured to prove before his companions his new gift absorbed at first in this unexpected response to the  strange thirst within them  the fateful growth the unnamed discontent the listeners sat in silence until the twin sister of music sprang into being the youths and maidens both alike longtressed by graceinspiring melody possessed rose in slow dance with beauteous floating swerve of limbs and hair and many a melting curve of ringed feet swayed by each closelinked palm  then jubal poured more rapture in his psalm the dance fired music music fired the dance the glow diffusive lit each countenance till all the circling tribe arose and stood with glad yet awful bhock of that mysterious good subsequently jubal having taught to others his newfound art travelled to where eastward the hills touch heaven and remained away until most of those who had known him were dead he returned to find cities where he had left pastoral valleys memory of the benefits he had bestowed survived however and the people on the day even of his return were holding a feast in his honour when the weary greyhaired wanderer claimed to be the jubal whom they worshipped the minstrels rose and beat him with their flutes for irreverence and he who had given mankind its most priceless boon sought the  screen of thorny thickets where alone and untended he died cheered only by visions of song the close of this striking amplification of the suggestion thrown out in genesis resembles closely the notion german in origin we believe upon which mr wills founded his  man of airlie agatha depicts the grave placid and beneficent existence of a woman halfgrandame and half saint repaying by prayers the assistance she obtains from the villagers among whom she dwells prayer to her is a  way of singing just as the nightingales pour forth sad songs not too sure is agatha that her intercessions are of much avail nay i cannot sing  my voice is hoarse and oft i think my prayers are foolish feeble things  for christ is good whether i pray or notthe virgins heart is kinder far than mine  and then i stop and feel i can do nought towards helping men her simple life sanctified wholly to the service of her faith and her warm and gentle creed that  would have young things merry are touchingly depicted armgart is a dramatic sketch showing the dominion of the artistic passion over the breast of the singer who can hold thousands spellbound by her song aud the defeat and collapse which follow when after a brief period of triumph the voice gives way and the priceless instrument is worthless just as devotion in agatha and the sound of the lyre in  jubal suffice for all expression of emotion the voice of armgart is adequate to all utterance  poor wretch she says of any murderess  the world was cruel and she could not sing i carry my revenges in my throat i love in singing and am loved again the fretfulnesses vanities and anxieties of the artistic temperament have seldom been depicted more forcibly than in this poem they are subjugated however by the absolute  possession which armgarts art exercises over her nature her reasons for rejecting the suit of graf dornberg are well given and the study of artistic fervour and feminine wilfulness is fine as it can be armgarts address to the doctor whose drugs while curing her illness of throat have ruined her voice is thoroughly impassioned yes thick thick thick  and you have murdered it t murdered my voicepoisond the soul in me and kept me living you never told me that your cruel cures were clogging filmsa mouldy deadening blight a lavamud to crust and bury rae yet hold me living in a deep deep tomb crying unheard for ever o your cures are devils triumphs  you can rob maim slay and keep a hell on the other side your cure where you can see your victim quivering between the teeth of torture c the lesson of patience armgart learns at length from the resignation of her musicmaster an old composer whose philosophical calm stands in effective contrast with the tumultuous effervescence of youth  how lisa loved the king catches happily the spirit and something of the note of provencal song it transports the reader to a court like that of king rene and to a world to which the golden age is restored where arcadian dreams are realized and where all pleasures are permissible since all desire is virtuous what song is to armgart music to jubal and devotion to agatha love is to lisa and the manner in which utterance is given to her aspiration is very fanciful and delicate of the new poems in the book  a minor prophet is our favourite here george eliot is on her own territory of humour nothing can be cleverer than the opening description nothing deeper more subtle more sympathetic and more significant than the application the poem commences i have a friend a vegetarian beer by name elias baptist butterworth a harmless bland disinterested man whose ancestors in cromwells day believed the second advent certain in five years but when king charles the second came instead revised their date and sought another world i meannot heaven butamerica a fervid stock whose generous hope embraced the fortunes of mankind not stopping short at rise of leather or the fall of gold nor listening to the voices of the time as housewives listen to a cackling hen with wonder whether she has laid her egg on their own nestegg still they did insist somewhat too wearisomely on though joys of their millennium when coats and hats would all be of one pattern books and songs ah flt for sundays and the casual talk as good as sermons preached extempore equally admirable is the description of elias in whom ancestral zeal is modified by  transatlantic air and modern thought with hair brushed back to show his great capacity a full grains length at the anglo of the brow proving him witty while the shallower men only seem witty in their repartees not that hes vain but that his doctrine needs the testimony of his frontal lobe the millennium of elias will be reached when men are all vegetarian and practical science and civilization will bring about the day when  dogs will all be moral and all  the uglier breeds will fade from memory when wartpigs with tender and parental grunts wombats much flattened as to their contour perhaps from too much crushing in the ark but taking meekly that fatality  the serious cranes unstung by ridicule  longheaded shortlegged solemnlooking curs wise silent critics of a flippant age the silly straddling foals the weakbrained geese hissing fallaciously at sound of wheels all these rude products will have disappeared along with every faulty human type by dint of diet vegetarian all will be harmony of hue and line bodies and minds all perfect limbs wellturned and talk quite free from aught erroneous sadly our author thinks of the consequences of such a state of affairs endowed with that sympathy and pity for error and that respect for failure which are the rarest most unmistakable and least regarded attributes of the highest genius she falls into a strain of regret for those who living in those perfect times will not know half the dear imperfect things that move my smiles and tearswill never know the fine old incongruities that raise my friendly laugh the innocent conceits that like a needless eyeglass or black patch give those who wear them harmless happiness the twists and cracks in our poor earthenware that touch me to more couscious fellowship i am not myself the finest parian with my coevals a noble moral indicated iu the line our finest hope is finest memory comes as the close of a poem which by its gentle teaching its fine sympathy and its sad irony moves

a little like the laureates poem of circumstance ariongives finely the legend told by herodotus the volume in all poetic respects is an advance upon the  spanish gypsy in those qualities which without being indispensable to poetry supplement and elevate it in largeheartednessjtenderness and humour it is worthy of the author of  the mill on the floss it cannot fail to advance its authors reputation bringing her nearer our sympathies as well as placing her higher in our admiration  literature the legend of jbal and other poemis by i georgeeliot london blackwood sons it is always instructive when a great painter turns sculptor or a great musician turns dramatist or a great poet turns novelist or as in the present case a great novelist turns poet there is always something fresh to be learned about the powers and the im pulses of the artist which have to find a fresh channel for themselves there is always something to be learned also about the limits of the old channels which no longer seem enough this is so especially in the case of such a personal spontaneous genius as george eliot all whose writings are necessary to the complete expression of herself with whom we are entirely safe from mere echoes of other writers which express nothing except an overambitious sympathy even shortcomings have their meaning and their interest when they are visibly due not to any defect of training or elaboration but to the habitual predominance of other faculties than those which are most helpful to the work in hand a great thinker cannot wait while fancy and emotion grow up into thought the thought must always be there and sometimes the fancy and emotion grow over the thought luxuriantly and sometimes though the overgrowth is always healthy the thought shows through in the spanish gypsy there was a constant incongruity the whole conception was poetical and verse was obviously the only appropriate vehicle for the most dramatic movements of the story but there were long intervals where the action flagged or was positively pushed aside by commentaries and dikcassions or was overlaid by ornament and it was hardly a compensation that the commentaries were an overflow of intellec tual sympathy with the situation and that the ornaments showed how much diligent and refined observation had fed the writers imagination of the scenery the present volume is on a smaller scale than the spanish gypsy or most of the authors works in prose and it contains at least one poem the eleven sonnets entitled  brother and sister which is all but perfectmore delightful if possible more classical than the parallel passages in the mill o0 tvw floss in the novel there is no doubt more human more concrete individual reality but in the poem we gain what is even more precious an unbroken ideal medium in which what is harsh and grotesqcue is wholly suppressed in order that what is permanent and beautiful and memorable may appear unalloyed nearly every sonnet contains gems like thesei held him wise and when lie talked to me of snakes and birds and which god loved the best i thought his knowldgo marked the boundary where men grew iixad though angels knew the rest  all at home

a subject sub specie aeternitatis  armgart  shows the superiority of the same instrument for expressing the fullness of passion which the growing reticence of modern civilisation tends to repress till it is probable that it will ultimately be extinguished like a fire deprived of air bear witness i am ealm i road my lot as soberly as if it were a tale writ by a creeping feuilletonist and called  the womans lot a tale of everyday a middling womans to impress the world with high superfluousness her thoughts a crop of chickweed errors or of potherb facts smiled at like some childs drawing on a

they print her things often for charityo a dogs life a harnessed dogs that draws a little cart voted a nuisance  it is impossible to write with more severity and compression of style and yet the effusion of feeling would have been excessive in prose again the verse certainly adds lightness and elevation to the bitter gaiety of leos answer when asked whether he expects his music to live when he is deadpfui the time was i drank that homebrewed wine and found it heady while my blood was young now it scarce warms me tipple it as i may i am sober still and say  my old friend leo much grain is wasted in the world and rots why not thy handful  on the other hand the description of armgarts reception by the house rather convinces us of the insufficiency of prose than of the sufficiency of verse and there are passages like the invention of butter in  jubal where what would have been easy and familiar in prose becomes strange without becoming beautiful inverse and in a minor prophet  there is a puzzling allusion to  astral cocoanuts which exemplifies a rather common fault of subtle and reflective poetry the writer sees that many things must always be left to the reader to comprehend at half a word and it is only in popular poetry that a traditional understanding exists to determine which of course the only reason for speaking of such things is that they intrude themselves on the attention less when they have been noticed and explained it is a pleasanter and more profitable study to compare how lisa loved the kino with its original in boccaccio and see how the modern writer has enlarged and deepened the meaning of the story without impairing its essential simplicity boccaccio keeps throughout to the tone of mere kindly courtesy with which wellbred people tell a graceful interesting story he does not dwell for a moment on the historical position of king pedro though the story is a ghibelline reply to a story of the temperance of king charles whom pedro dispossessed nor on the growth of lisas passion nor upon the spirit in which she accepted her happiness what might have been seen and heard is enough for him and out of this he makes one of the best of his prose idylls and in all that he says with one exception george eliot follows him closely the justification of and the originality of her poem is the wealth of brooding feeling which is poured into the space which boc caccio has left blank tue central point both of the story and of the poem may bo said to lie in the song which tells pedro the talc of lisas hopeless love boccaccio is deliciously sweet and musical and genuine but he does not get beyond the shy broken sob of animal feeling and innocent helpless pain the singer feels the pathos of this side of the situation too much to care to in tellectualise it the approaching death of the lovelorn maiden simply measures the ardour of her hopeless passion whereas in george eliot the worship of death be comes the keynote of four lovely stan zas of which the last is the clirqaxtell him 0 love i am a lowly maid mo nore than any little knot of thyme that lho with careless foot may often tread yet lowliest fragrance oft will mount sublime and cleave to things most high and hallowz1 as doth the fragrance of my lifes springtime my lowly love that soaring seeks to climb within his thought and makei a gentle bliss more blissful than if mine in being his so shlall i live in him and rest in death the glorification of death is of course though burden of  jubal  it reads throughout almost like an answer to the early numbers of the e arthly paradise and the impression is all the stronger because the music of though answer is so often like an echo of the music of the challenge in both the dis cussion is carried on as it ought to be rather in accordance with the logic of feeling than the logic of signs mr morriss contention is that it is precisely when life is at its best that the thought of death poison it george eliot maintains with feuerbachs that it is death at a distance which gives life all its value and death at hand which puts the seal upon life when jubal returns in old age and finds his memory worshippedall was forgotten but the burning need to claim his fuller self to clhihn the deed that lived away from him and grew apart while he as from a tomb with lonely heart warmed by no meeting gla nee no hand that presse lay chill amid the life his life had blessed what though his song should spread from mans small race out through the myriad worlds that people space and make the heavens one joydiffusing choir  still mid that vast would throb the keen desire of this poor aged flesh this eventide this twilight soon in darkness to subside this little pulse of self that having glowed through thrice three centuries and divinely strowed the light of music through the vague of sound ached smallness still in good that had no bound after his rejection the solution isyea art thou come again to me oreat song the face bent over him like silver night in longremembered summers that calm light of days which shine in firmament of thouhit that past unchangeablo from change still wrought and there were tones that with though vision blent he know not if that gaze the music sent or music that calm gaze to hear to see was but one undivided ecstasy the raptured senses melted into one and parting life a moments freedom won from in and outer as a little child sits on a bank and sees blue heavens mild down in the water and forgets its limibs and knoweth nought savo the blue heaven that swims jubal the face mid  i am thy loved past the soul that makes thee one from first to last i am the angel of thy life and death thy outbreathod being drawing its last breath am i not thine alone a dear dead bride who blessed thy lot above all mens beside  thy bride whom thou wouldst never chang nor take any bride living for that dead oes sakeo of course if any one were foolish enough to attempt to translate this into the logic of signs he would expose himself to the obvious observation that it is no more in our power to possess ourselves of our whole past than o the whole future of our work and that therefore it is idle to teach that we ought to be content to have our past for ourselves and give up our work to the world seriously if we are to expect either for ourselves we have an equal right to expect both from the liberality of a power able to do aiundantly above all that we can ask or think the fact is that there are problems presented by the permanent facts of the world which can only receive an objective solution if at all from paramount facts which show that the best which we can apprehend in the little that we know is supreme in the much which we do not know in this life but whatever objective solution we adopt or whether we despair of any we need a subjective solution for the subjective pro blem presented by the alternations of our own moods such a solution has never been given more worthily than in jubal and in the glorious lines beginning 0 may i join the choir invisible which form the epilogue of the volume and make the posi twist heaven for the first time intelligible and desirable because for the first time the conception has been lifted above the level of controversy from which it suffers even more than the majority of religious conceptions since there are few which are so open to be taunted with unanswerable questions indeed the whole volume is a splendid homage to the great principle of the inherent supremacy of feeling over thought which it is one of comtes chief merits to have formulated though be shrank from its legitimate consequences which is not surprising when we remember whence he took it and this gives an artistic value and completeness to the poetry of george eliot which is missing in some measure in her prose works though the latter are richer and more varied and more masterly the writer seems constantly trying to escape into the atmosphere of high impulse and momentary feeling in which the poems move habitually the love of lisa is an exquisite satisfaction to the perilous and invincible desire with dream fruit dream wishes to fulfil throughout  armgart her singleminded impetuosity is contrasted with the essential unexceptionable baseness of the count so as to show how ruinous it is simply to be consistently reasonable in matters of conduct  and by what is what will be to define aringarts impulsiveness is il fact the key to the whole poem she aggravates her loss by her eagerness to measure it and the particular form of her resignation is very much a matter of accident it would have been easy to find practical and ideal reasons if they were the thing required to show that her talent as an actress was too good to be wasted and that it would be foolish to destroy the chance of her voice recovering itself by teaching it would have been equally easy to prove that her tardy sym pathy for walpurga and leo it is an ad mirable trait that walpurga accuses her while she accuses herself to leo wvas a motive for generalisinc her revolt not for subsiding into submission but the poet resists the temltation to a systematic intel lectual pessimism as she resists the temptation to a systematic intellectual opti mism which would have made the moral change in armgart a compensation for the loss of her voice the only approach to a glorification of right reason is the very interesting poem on stradivarius who defends his simple straightforward perfect work triumphantly against a painter naldo knowing all tricks of style at thirtyone and weary of them  who tells stradivariuss thou nrt little more than a deft potters wheel antonio turning out work by more necessity and lack of varied function higher arts subsist on freedomeccentricityuncounted inspirations influenco that conies with drinking gambling talk turned wild then moody misery and lack of foodwith every dithyrumbic fine excess only when we remember that southey worked and prepared himself for work on the principle of stradivarius and that hoff mann and byron prepared themselves for work on the principles of naldo and compare the value of their work we see how hard it is to draw universal inferences from the best selected facts no one would be less disconcerted by this difficulty than the author who combines the most resolute and exalted hope with a keen perception of the ridiculous nature of all utopias which are a premature attempt to anticipate in detail the realisation of aspirations which it is well to cherish not even the conclave at the rainbow shows a sharper sense of humour than the minor prophet an american vegetarian and spiritualist who holdsthat thought was rapping in the hoary past and might have edified the greeks by raps at the greater dionysia if their ears had not been filled with sophoclean verse and when all earth is vegetarianwhen lacking butchers quadrupeds die out and less

the ministers wooing by h beecher stowe a low  co 11 in this novel the leading events of which the p preface informs us are  founded on actual j p facts and the principal characters of which are historic mrs stow endeavours to depict the mannera and austere religious life of new england at the close of the last century she especially commends her work to the kindly  1 thoughts of the british firesidea compliment j c which we predict the british public will repay 11 by asking for the story at the circulating libra  s ries and in due course coming to the conclusion j that notwithstanding numerous blemishes which go a long way towards counterbalancing its i merits it is a tale to be read and for nine days  to be talked about the critical few will find amusement in comparing an american ladys description of the transatlantic puritanism to which whitfield imparted fresh earnestness more than a hundred years ago with the light satiric view taken of the same subject by mr thackeray in  the virginians the ministers wooing is a love tale a religious novel and an historicor rather biographicfiction all in one regarded as the first it deserves almost unqualified praise judged of as the second it merits a certain amount of blame but viewed as an illustration of history it is open to very grave censure the opening chapters as we indicated last december induce the reader to hope he is going to be treated with a series of simple domestic episodes although his feelings are early harrowed with an enumeration of the horrors of the slave trade but unfortunately these expectations are to a certain extent disappointed and the whole question of negro emancipation is dragged up for rediscussion in this the author has acted very unwisely with all its misstatements and onesidedness exaggeration and reticence uncle toms cabin was a powerful story and created a memorable sensation  equal perhaps to that caused amongst educated english people almost two hundred years before by afra behns oroonoko the first  nigger novel of our literature mrs stow would have decided well for her fame if imitating the caution of hamilton with his famous speech she had allowed this bril liant success to remain in solitary splendour and had not lessened its effect by endeavouring to repeat it the reception that  dred met with in this country must have convinced her that her english admirers were weary of listening to the cracking of legrees whip and that their craving for imagined woes must for some time to come be gratified with more refined sorrows than the tortures of slavemarkets and plantations down south very likely mrs stow is well aware of all this for the tone of her arguments against slavery in the present work is milk and honey in comparison with the scalding indignation of the story that first brought her into notoriety there is a wide difference between the inspired angel of abolition who penned  uncle toms cabin and the calm argumentative lady who in  the ministers wooing is content with coldly enunciating the moral obligation of all men to help the oppressed and this change can only be accounted for on the supposition that either she has so far outlived the ardour of her earlier impressions that what a few years since would have been the language of fervid poetry is now nothing more than a mere habit of sermonizing or else that accurately appreciating the state of public feeling she only breathes gently on the embers of a dying enthusiasm well knowing that a stronger current of air would altogether extinguish the feeble sparks that still linger in them the scheme of that part of the story on which the rest of the narrative is hung is simple and pretty enough the drama opens with a teaparty in the parlour of the widow scudder who is a lady blessed with a small farm and  a gambrelroofed cottage on the outskirts of newport a charming daughter the heroine a sweet little maiden just emerging from chudj hoodand a high reputation for the possession j of  faculty the precise meaning of which term  may be found in the athenmtm for december  25 1858 j the principal inmate of the widow scudders house is dr h the minister who does the wooing a divine of extreme calvinistic j opinions of pure life and of a gentle nature  a man dwelling in a world of spiritual abstraci tions guileless and simpleminded as a child  austere in his habits and of inflexible firmness of principle studious and abstracted he is a kind of coleridge divested of poetic faculty and imbued with moral stability the good man is a bachelor something over forty years of age and besides officiating zealously amongst j his congregation ministering to his afflicted j black brethren and writing a profound system i of divinity finds time to act to the fair mary scudder his landladys daughter the part that abelard did to heloise he is her tutor in religious and secular studies and she in return instructs him in the art of loving but unlike heloise of old mary only conceives for him that reverential affection which a young maiden naturally entertains for her pastor who appears to her an the expression of all the goodness that is possible in humanity the widow scudder would gladly see her daughter love the pastor dearly enough to wish to be his wife  but the meek gentle child wilful in one thing only bestows her heart on a wicked scapegrace of a cousin james marvyn who having run 31 away from home and been to sea returns from 3 foreign countries to laugh at the sanctimonious ways of the godly people of newport and to question the doctrine of election and predestination the young man of course is condemned by the surrounding respectability as r utterly reprobate and poor little mary is con tinually being informed that her cousin her playmate from infancy her dearest cousin is doomed to eternal perdition the child has also amongst other tenets of that religion which calvinism grafted on the stern nature of the puritan colonists called into existence has been taught that it is her duty to contemplate the idea of her own eternal punishment with lively pleasure if by such suffering the happiness of mankind at large could be increased naturally she applies this terrible doctrine to the state of her own mind in relation to her cousin until she feels she could willingly surrender herself a sacrifice to neverending torment in order to secure him admission to an eternity of bliss one afternoon james has a stolen interview with her to say farewell as next day he is about to start on a long voyage after much earnest and pathetic conversation on religion which we extracted when noticing the first number of this work james gives her a parting kiss and once more goes off to sea the voyage is one of disaster the ship is wrecked and news comes home that tames marvyn is drowned the intelligence well nigh kills poor little mary and for many a day she seems going the downward way to death her mother who has become possessed of her darlings secret watches her narrowly anxiously and prayerfully but mary does not die her physical strength is gradually restored to her and though her heart is saddened for life she prepares like the noble selfsacrificing girl she is to forget her own woes as much as possible and to devote her life to making others happy time passes on and dr h wno has comforted her in her sorrow and sickness ignorant of the nature of the wound her affections have suffered begs her to be his wife to gratify her mother to make a good man happy and to secure to herself a field of usefulness mary accepts him the wedding clothes are provided and the day for her marriage is fixedav the day is not a week distant on which january and may are to be united togetherand mary is training herself to look cheerfully on her future as the bride of the good and venerable dr h when one fine morning aa she walks in solitary meditation in the fields a voice is heard behind her and a quick step beats the ground and an arm is put round her waist and she falls fainting in her true lovers arms instead of being drowned james marvyn has returned home rich the rest of all this pretty romance can be imagined mary acknowledges to james that he has her heart but she is nevertheless determined to keep her promiseher solemn engagement to good dr h and bids her lover not to hinder her from doing her duty there is a pause of uncertainty and suspense the awful day draws nearer but ere it has arrived a jolly little dressmaker miss prissy who acts the part of an amiable sprite all through the play informs the doctor of the state of the case the finehearted man takes all the sorrow of the position to himself surrenders the timid child he loves so dearly to the man of her choice and sets his face resolutely forward to do his duty in that unwedded life which it seems providence has designed for him  you all know he said turning to mary who sat very near him  the near and dear relation in which i have been expecting to stand towards this friend i should not have been worthy of that relation if i had not felt in my heart the true love of a husband as set forth in the new testament who should love his wife even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it and if in case any peril or danger threatened this dear girl and i could not give myself for her i had never been worthy the honour she has done me for i take it wherever there is a cross or a burden to be born by one or the other that the man who is biade in the image of god as to strength and endurance should take it upon himself and not lay it upon her that is weaker for he is therefore strong not that he may tyrannise over the weak but bear their burdens for them even as christ for his church i have just discovered he added looking kindly upon mary  that there is a great cross and burden which must come either on thia dear child or on myself through no fault of either of us but through gods good providence and therefore let me bear it mary my dear child i will be to thee as a father but i will not force thy heart this is touching and well told but how does it all square with the facts on which the story ia founded who is this good dr h this pattern minister so forgetful of himself where the happiness of others is concerned who subsequent to the declaration of independence is represented as forty years of age childless and unwived  he is no other than the celebrated samuel hopkins dd pastor of the first congregational church in newport and cofounder with jonathan edwards of that awful that indescribably ferocious system of calvinistic theology known as the hopkintonian or hopkinsian but unfortunately for the truthfulness of mrs stowes tale samuel hopkins was born in the year 1721 and did not settle in newport till the year 1770 consequently instead of being forty at the outset of his wooing which commences after the recognition of american independence by england he must be regarded as more than sixty years old but further dr hopkins married in 1748 joanna ingersol who presented him with eight children and livea with him as his wife till her death on the last day of august in 1793 and on the 14th of september 1794 the doctor then in his seventyfourth year married again taking for his second wife miss elizabeth west a lady only sixteen or seventeen years younger than himself it is a matter of certainty that samuel hopkins was in no respect such a man as mrs stow has depicted him it is true that he was an abolitionist and published in 1776 a dialogue concerning the slavery of the africans but instead of being a shiftless dreamer incapable of looking after his worldly interests and wanting a religious landlady to rouse him up and tell nim when he was hungry he was a keen and energetic man and as well able to make a bargain as any other citizen of the united states although he owned a farm and made considerable sums by his literary productions he threatened to quit his congregation at newport if they could not provide comfortably for him and mrs stow can scarcely be ignorant of how active he was in organising prayermeetings amongst his flock such misrepresentations as these altogether overstep the limits which ought to restrain the imagination of a writer of historic fiction in such composition it is allowable to exercise the imagination in amplifying and giving colour to the views of history by the creation of any series of positions and incidents which are in accordance with recorded facts but surely a too daring disregard of veracity is exhibited by though writer who professes to sketch the life of an eminent person and at the same time misrepresents it in the most important particulars what object can mrs stow have in saying that her story is founded on facts when the masterincident of the book is pure fiction are the facts of uncle toms cabin of a similar kind  other historical characters besides dr hopkins are brought on the stage but not with greater felicity col aaron burr figures away with madame de frontignac deluging that lady and all the rest of the fair sex whom he addresses with very awkward adulation but this is a slight fault and one easily accounted for doubtless it has been mrs stowes pro vince throughout life to receive rather than to pay compliments we cannot discuss at length the religious side of this novel in that respect it forms a striking contrast to the tales of miss sewell being marked by a boldness of speculation and language which one would in vain look for in the writings of our own countrywomen it is we are willing to believe written in a devout and reverential spirit but it is to be regretted that one of the saddest exhibitions of the perverseness of the human intellect when directed to the contemplation of sacred mysteries should have been dragged into a pretty love story to disfigure ana even to mar it the eicture of mrs marvyns agony on hearing of er sons death and her despair of his salvation is as revolting a spectacle of spiritual buffering as uncle tom dying under the whips of his persecutors was of bodily torture if the hook should become popular its success will be won not by its polemical qualities but by the winning graces of the heroine and her little friend of the great world verginie in the construction and elaboration of marys character genuine artistic power is manifested in conception it lacks originality for in many respects she is a combination of longfellows evangeline and that form of youngladyism which has for some years been fashionable in american novels and many features of her mind and incidents of her life have been taken with judicious selection from the numerous puritan memoirs which formed an important division of american literature in the last and few preceding generations the memoirs of mrs harriet neweu and hopkinss memoirs of miss susanna anthony who died at newport rhode island in 1791 have manifestly been carefully read by mrs stowe in conclusion we may add that amongst the pleasant peculiarities of the book are innumerable americanisms some of them intentionally and some unconsciously employed by the author to educate young ladies is to  fetch them up and a matron wno superintends her domestic servants is said  to follow them round prominent too amongst its national characteristics the reader will notice the authors passion for  talking philosophy her familiar mention of plato as  an old heathen and her anxiety to display an intimate acquaintance with the art galleries and cathedrals of europe the annoyance of our transatlantic cousins at their own want of the memorials of ancient art is one of their most patent foibles and we are not awafre that it was ever more humorously expressed than by the new york merchant who on being reminded amidst the ruins of pompeii that his country was entirely devoid of any such interesting relics answered  yes stranger thats an almighty truth we have got no remains like these here buti guess we precious soon shall have some  tiik ministers wooiv0 literature in his splendid article on milton lord macaulay did justice to our english puritans the world

sketch ofthe life character and writings of baroness de staelholstein  3 v   by madame necker de saussure translated from the french bvo pp 30j london is 20 madame de stael was a lady possessed o such extraor dinary genius and splendid talents and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character cannot fail of being interesting the first of female writers perhaps of this or of auy age she not only possessed a commanding influence in france during the most eventful period of its history but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness and respected if not admired in every state of europe some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of madame de stael and passing over the knowledge of human nature the fidelity of observation and the acuteness of remark which she displayed in all her writings haye with a most fastidious delicacy carped at some passages which taken even abstractedly were never doubtful the present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman but a critical examination of her writings aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life and when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of madame de stael who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting we will not follow madame de saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works of madame de stael and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged  but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life which is the more interesting as it is the least known in u  general examination ofthe talents of madame de stael the author remarks   before she appeared religion and knowledge had their separate defenders these two grand causes have been pleaded as we may say in opposition each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas there has been in this respect a secret division among mankind one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason the other that of faith out of pure civility  madame de stael alone has embraced with equal zeal the party of knowledge and that of religion she alone has adopted from the bottom of her heart whatever was best in different ages combating on one side ancient prejudices and ignorance and on the other modern selfishness and incredulity   madame de stael loved what was about her and extended to human nature her affection for her friends what her style wants of minute finish is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse by the freshness ofthe inspiration if i may venture to use the term lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain that sparkles as it flows  but something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties there is a marked originality in each yet all bearing a similar stamp which is pe culiar to madame de stael t his peculiar stamp originates from her character from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions from those sudden bursts of indignation of compassion of haughtiness and also from her never ceasing to be a woman  this last is perhaps her secret charm she addresses herself as a woman to the reader and presents herself personally to him to tell him what passes in her mind and also in his own but she is aware that he would soon forget her being a woman if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him accordingly whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle she never overpowers him with her superioritv he never arrogates to herself any preeminence it seems as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs and she recited what was thus offered to her view  sometimes too she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman whose sight is a little indistinct she explains to him all he perceives confusedly and places him in a bright sunshine that he may see a little more clearly himself when she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths she says to him  do not be afraid you will be glad you have passed we shall soon get safe out of it constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him she brings herself forward to divert him by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives persons words faces accents attitudesdresses every thing in fact strikes her every thing is characteristic in her pictures she knows herself as well as she knows others and that blind instinct which so frequently determines us to like or dislike is in hera feeling founded on motives of which she gives a clear account  the precision of her views is such that we forget their extreme clelicacy she has no vain subtilty does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible but even thing l  enlarges under her hands lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point and it becomes so distinct to her that none of its bearings escape her notice but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong the importance of which is acknowledged thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications  the copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect take at a venture any three of her pages and three of the authors most abounding in wit we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in madame de stael not that she affects conciseness every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together and perhaps there are two manyperhaps certain phrases which are superfluous to the train of reasoning have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck the succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in madame de stael to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it she is the goddess of plenty she scatters from full hands corn pearls roses ribands and diadems we would jet nothing escape us because every thing is of value but we may be fatigued in collecting it  on the whole the works of madame de stael appear to belong to a new age they announce as they tend to produce another period in society and in literature the age of strong generous animated thoughts sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart she has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort rather spoken than written of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies unrestrained confidence and conversational sallies inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics of the passions and of society than studied rhetoric has ever done the second part of this work is entitled  social and domestic life of madame de stael and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light   the distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her the sentiment was one and the same in her and assumed the decided cast of her character much more than that of the different relations of life or the disposition of the persons she loved in her maternal and filial affection friendship gratitude all seemed love lhere was passion or at least emotion in all her attachments they appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind and they were naturally expansive ardent impetuous and even stormy not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in madame de stael but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society and often human indolence oppose to the enjoyments of the heart for a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments that did not express themselves like hers and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error when she judged of others from herself but her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting her love was conspicuous through her anger she never gave pain to another but because she felt more herself and you could not avoid pitying her even when she wounded you most severely the affection of madame de stael for her father evinced itself on every occasion by the most watchful attention on him during his life and after his death she conceived she had lost everr earthly comfort with him  1 it would be necessary to relate how every day passed with madame de stael if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart she never ceased to live with him she always felt herself protected consoled succoured by him she invoked him in her prayers and never did any occurrence that was fortunate for her take place without her saying ic my father obtained that for ne his miniature she always carried about her and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition she never parted with it except on one occasion very ill herself and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait she imagined that when her daughter lay in it would produce the same effect on her accordingly she sent it to her desiring her to look on it when she was in pain every old man too recalled her father to her mind and made aparticular impression on her to every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible and once when in the time of her persecutions an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity then common and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age she wras extraordinarily grieved at it  i am very silly said she to me  but what would you have he was kind he was old he sat at my table i altered my hours for him and all these things grieve me to the heart her bounty to the aged who stood in need of her assistance was immense the idea of their sufferings tore her heart and as true christians see jesus christ in all who are poor she saw her father in every man that was old her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent and although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards madame de genlis who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms yet when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of madame necker it was with the utmost difficulty she could be restrained from resenting it  there is great beauty in the thought of that basrelief which after the death of m necker madame de stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents an airy figure as if already beatified is drawing towards the skies another that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled and prostrate on a tomb madame necker her husband and her daughter are represented under this emblem which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal the motto of madame de stael might have been the following verse which she often repeated with emotion    o liberte de rome 6 manes de mon peer   o roman freedom manes of my father  madame de stael could not avoid forming many friendshins she whispered this sentiment almost at first sight and she was touched with the effect which she produced and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections  there are ninety dtgrevs fixed saul she in my affections ami only ten moveable she was always free in her remarks on her friends and spared none of though objects of her attachment   this continual appreciation of her friends not only every one but of each daily this appreciation made incessantly  their presence sometimes hutt them and led them to doubt her affection  with you we must submit to be judged it fresh cost every morning said ito her  what signifies it answered she  if i love thee more every pveningrnbc added  were i going to the scaffold v could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me in her habitual society madame de stael was full of charms in burr company there was no restraint thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person  she asked only for amusement not for trials of skill i she could not endure people to talk with indifference how can he expect me to attend to him she would ay  when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself  she could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller  that man talks only of himself but he does not tyre me hecuase i am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says   she had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing  she wa the naturalist observing a species as well as the orator that would persuade  but what deranged this study completely what took from her all interest in peoples words was affectation this tault which effaces every prominent feature which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom instead of the inunene variety of moral nature was profoundly tiresome to her ami scarcely less vexatious she expressed herself thus on ihe subject  there is never any such thing as a tele dtce with affected people the personage assumed makes a third and it is thlsthat answers when you speak to the otheraffected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned exaggeration too displeased her much  lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten she would say for the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility all natural feeling she remarked  have a degree of modesty  from a sketch of her conversation political opitnons and repartees we shall select a few of the most striking passages  when she was told of the follies of some witty man she would say f give him more wit and all these will van h one of her swedish friends observing to her  whatever von may say witty people commit a great many faults die answered  that is very true  but unfortunately stupid persons do the same though nobody thinks it worth while to ur  tice them another time she said  the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men  her attachment to france never abated not even ui i she had been banished from it ami incurred the enmity of its rulers i have a corroding grief respecting france she wrote  which 1 love more than ever and again  i have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that france but it must be confessed her country was more eset lally paris   show me the rue de bac said she once to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e i ac of geneva and its banks  i would willingly live at fris said she again  with a hundred pounds a j ear itt a lodging up four pair of stairs in 1806 when shepent four dtys ni paris in concealment her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night to view the streets by moonlight  i have a constancy of heart she wrote u and an inconstancy of mind for whick a country is formed where the scenes are incessantly renewing and where 1 have my old friends   it is very remarkable that always cutting to the quick in disputation always touching the most sensible points she always conciliated in her presence those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies you might be grazed be wounded in the contest but you always went away healed or at least she had applied balsam to the sore   you desire then my death or my dishonour said an emigrant to her in switzerland as he was going to the army on the frontiers  no answered she  what i wish is your defeat and yourglcry i would have you except being slain be like hector the hero of a vanquished army  the following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events  while she was in england in 1814 some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of paris which put an end to her banishment to these expressions of politeness she answered  on what do you compliment me pray on my being in the height of distress  it was from the date of the battle of leipzig that she began to be alarmed for france 4 in 1815 when bonaparte had already entered lyons a lady attached to his party came and said to madame de stael  the emperor knows madame how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes i hope answered she  he will know how much i detest him  during the hundred days she said  if all the declamatory phrases uttered this winter against the revolution had been enlisted we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the coth of march  in 1810 mr canning having thought proper to say to madame de stael in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bedchamber in the palace of the tuillcries  lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions madam france has submitted to u and we have conquered youyes answered sile  because you had all europe and the cossacs on your side but meet us tetedtete and we shall see she  said also to mr canning  the english nation is deceived  it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion  if it knew this it would renounce those who thus abuse its name   fiance said she  must remain as dead as long as it is occupied by foreigners first let us have independence and then think of libertv  she said of mr de bonald  he is the philosopher of antiphilosophy  but this will not carry a man very far   the ministerial party observed she  looks at the prosaic side of human nature and opposition at the poetical side this is why i have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter  some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures what would you have me say answered she he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality and he who has not should not accept a post of difficulty  in 1816 she said of the ministry  i do not like it yet 1 prefer it it is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses yet still it is a barrier  on occasion of the great number of persons enobled she said  it would be best to create france a marquis once for all l  she set no great value on puns yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness in a dispute on the slave trade with a french lady of high rank the latter said to her 4t what madam then you are much interested for the count of limonade and the marquis of marmalade why not as much as for the duke of bouillon  answered she  bonaparte having caused her to be told in 1815 that she must return to paris because he wanted her for the sake of constitutional ideas she refused saying  he contrived to do without a constitution and without me for a dozen years and he has now the same regard for the one that he has for the other even at this period however when any frenchmen passed by coppet in their way to join the army ofthe allies she endeavoured to divert them from their design not approving their endangering the independence of the nation even to acquire liberty  she was already dangerously ill when the  manuscript from st helena began to make a great noise in france notwithstanding the state of weakness to which madame de stael was reduced she made her children read the work to her and criticised it with all her strength of mind  the chaldeans worshipped the serpent said she the bonapartists do the same to the manuscript from st helena but i am far from sharing their admiration lt is but in the style of the notes ofthe moniteur and if ever i recover i think i can refute this writing with a high hand  r one of bonapartes ministers having desired her to be told that the emperor would reward her if she would attach herself to him she answered  i was aware that a certificate of being alive is necessary to the receipt of an annuity but i did not know that it required a declaration of love  notwithstanding the liberality and noble facility of madame de staels disposition great order was observed in the management of her house and estate so that her circumstances were constantly prosperous when under her government her mornings she devoted to business that is to the care of her property and to study and her evenings to society and to correspondence   the only luxury on which she set any value was the having accommodation for her friends and being able to invite to dinner persons with whom she wished to become acquainted  i have hired a cook that travels postsaid she  is not this exactly what i wanted to give dinners in dishabille throughout europe   the following anecdote is highly characteristic and displays madame de stael in a very amiable point of view   about twenty years ago when on a visit to me in the country it was proposed to play proverbs a sketch of marmontel entitled le barara the prater was selected in which a great lady ill and nervous consents to use her interest in favour of an old soldier who is soliciting a pension but on the express condition that he states his case to her in the fewest words possible the prater who is duly cautioned beforehand nevertheless indulges himself in such an exuberance of words that he exhausts the patience of his patroness and she will have nothing more to say to him madame de stael represented the great lady at first she acted her part very well she counterfeited languor to perfection next weariness then vexation and impatience but when the moment came for inflicting pain on the old soldier it was impossible for her to bring herself to this he had spoken of his wife and children he was at bottom one of the best men in the world it required too hard a heart to refuse him quitting therefore altogether her assumed character and totally destroying the point ofthe piece she told him with real emotion that in future he had better not talk so much but that for this time she would undertake his suit suclvin fact wat madame de stael she was not only incapable of giving pain to any person voluntarily but subject as she was to ennui she really felt none when she could be useful to others of her religious character we have the following account   among the happy effects of time on madame de stael 4 l  ii11 j  1  1     14t matta which had always looked to the consequences of her actions attached themselves more to their motives prayer that sentimental want of hers placing her incessantly in communication with the source of all excellence caused a pure light to penetrate her heart  whenever i am alone i pray said she to her children she wrote to me from sweden on the subject of mr de montmorency   there is no such thing as absence to the religious because they meet in the sentiment of prayer every moment we find in her letters a request to pray for her and her children  madame de stael thought it was pride in man to endeavour to penetrate the secret of the universe and speaking of the higher metaphysics she said  i prefer the lords prayer to it all during her long sleeplessness she was accustomed to repeat this prayer incessantly in order to calm her mind sighs certain exclamations that she was in the habit of uttering were with her pious invocations thus the following words that escaped her frequently  poor human nature alas what are we ah life life were religious sentiments venting themselves lu her last illness she was seen constantly exerting the virtues for which she was distinguished  and on the days when she suffered most pain she was employed in acts of kindness s she was heard to utter delightful sayings in her peculiar way t i have always been the same lively and sad she observed to mr chateaubriand  i love god my father and liberty  on quoting these words of fontenelle  i am a frenchman i am fourscore years old yet i never ridiculed the slightest virtue she added i can say as much of the slightest suffering  unquestionably she felt great regret at parting with her children and friends stoicism or the particular kind of enthusiasm that is capable of closing the heart to the pains of eternal separation entered not into her character her daughter in particular cost her many tears  with such treasures of affection she dictated for me in speaking of the objects of her regard  it is a sad thing to quit life  i should be very sorry she said likewise  if every thing were at an end between albertine madame de broglie and me in another world but she rather regretted life than really feared death she may have dreaded the last pangs an imagination like hers may have felt some horrors at the idea of physical dissolution terrible as it is to all of us  but death morally considered gave her no alarm she preserved so much tranquility as to wish to dictate to mr schlegel the description of what she felt her thoughts were always turned with hope towards her father and towards immortality  my father waits for me on the other shore she said she beheld her father with god and in god himself could see nothing but a father these two ideas were confounded in her heart and that of a protecting goodness was inseparable from both one day rousing from a state of reverie she said  i think i know what the transition from life to death is and i am sure that the goodness of god softens it to us our ideas become confused and the pain is not very acute  her confidence was not disappointed the profoundest tranquillity presided over her last moments long before she expired the grand struggle had ended and her soul departed gently it can scarcely be necessary to extend this article by any further remarks on madame de stael or on the present work that it is written with the partiality of a friend and an ardent admirer of madame de stael is avowed and yet there is scarcely an assertion or an opinion respecting her that has not already been justified or is so by the present volume this work is published in french so that those who may prefer reading it in the original will have the opportunity we may however observe that the translation is well executed,biography

the majority of her comedies were successfulshe seems to have been a plagiarist ather from haste than sterility of imagination being at times compelled to write by pressing and urgent necessity she received the incense and compliments of the men of literature of her times among whom may be reckoned mr charles cotton who prefixed to her  lovers watch some complimentary linesmr charles gibson with whom she lived in habits of friendship observes it that she extorted admiration by maintaining the force and gaiety of her genius in the midst of disappointmenthe addsi she had great strength of mind and command of her faculties being able to write in the midst of comupany and at the same time take a share in conversation her works though reprehensible for their licentiousness abound in the language of passion her personal qualities are thus described by the writer of her memoirs  she had an open generous temper somewhat choleric yet friendly and placable incapable of doing a wilful injury she had wit honour goodnature and judgment mistress of the arts of converration yet frank and sincere a woman of sense and a lover of pleasure more gay and free than allowed by the strict yet

assisted their development by a liberal education the rapid progress and improvement made by anne in different branches of science and learning did credit to the judgement of her father and testified the promise of her early years she died prematurely in the 25th year of her age the following particulars of her character and endowments are extracted from the funeral sermon preached by john prude at the parish church of barnes  by this gentleman we are informed that she was well acquainted with philosophy astronomy mathematics and physics that she was snot only conversant with these sciences but a mistress of them and that to such a degree as few of her sex ever attained she was familiar with the writingi of the ancients in their original languages at the age of twentythree she took great pains to perfect herself in the greek language that she might have the pleasure of reading in their native purity the works of st chrysostom her compositions in latin were written in a pure and elegant style i she was accustomed to declare that it was a sin to be content with alittle knowledge about twvo years previous to her death her spirits seem to have been impressed swith an idea of her early dissolution a sentiment which first suggested itself to her mind while walking alone among the tombs in a churchyard and which she indulged with a kind of superstitious complacency on her deathbed she earnestly entreated the minister who attended her to exhort all the young people of his congregation to the stud of wisdom and knowledge as the means of moral improvement and real

princes8 helene von racowitza8 auto i biography translated from the ger i man by cecil mar constable  co princess helene von racowrtzas autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of george merediths novels and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of the tragic comedians in the memorial edition of his works it is now rather more than thirty years since the princess published that account of her relations with lassalle upon which meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained his explanation brilliant and masterly as it was omitted a very important factor after all the strangest action of the heroine of the story was not her submission to her familywhich had it been the action of one of his own heroines meredith would conceivably have praised nor yet her marriage with the luckless yanko for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion and a somewhat too com placent champion of her own part in the affair clotilde the princess as meredith represents her would have been both too astute and too selfconscious to have committed this astounding blunder but the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked lassalle whether the countess hatzfeld would have to live with them an incident omitted by mere dith who no doubt thought it an in vention of the princesss and the first thing to recognise about clotildes original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing in a spirit of in genuousness verging upon fatuity  this she writes of her present volume ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child the autobiography then convinces us that the story of  the tragio comedians like that of another lady of high distinction for wit and beauty curiously enough merediths next is to be read as fiction  nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them though not a few are discoverable the whole course of the princess helenes life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with clotildes she was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous dashing manner and she went on her way vaguely drifting spasmodically candid playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures it accepting these in whatever form they offered themselves with open arm while still a child she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life and carried them into practice bw she submitted formally to her parents choice where suitors were concerned s0 that on meeting lassalle when she va nineteen she was the typical  jeune file allemande incapable of selfdirection and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility durng the short period of her engagement to lassalle she wanted she says  to tell him all about my past life and my crimes against saintly morality  but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand no no for heavens sake dont let us have any pompeian excavations   and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the autobiography the pages that treaty of lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume but even without them it would be worth reading so great is the variety of the writers experiences her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed she handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence with the support of course of her exuberant vitality that she adopted at need or was ready to adopt the professions of actress physician artist journalist in turnnot without success or some promise of it in all she was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination and took up flower  painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time indeed there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writers practical ability and common sense it is not less remarkable though less engaging that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth the conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to lassalles death a narrative sincere and poignant but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks is puzzlingly absurd the gigantic edifice of the german empire must always she writes have seemed like a prison  to lassalle  i therefore ask whether we pigmies all of us were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny and need gthe spirit of the worlds history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the empire it is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is a theosophist who published anonymously some years ago a little book entitled wie ich mein selbst fand her accounts of the many notable persons with whom she has come into contact from hans andersen and bulwer lytton of whom the latter would read aloud from his own works  while  in especially poetic passages his alice accompanied him with arpeggios on the harp to bjbrnstjerne bjrnson the wonderful old athlete his beautiful white curly hair standing straight up are always vivid and amusing and it is surprising that in a book in which personal jottings play a large part and much that is trivial is recorded there should be

regarded with extreme disfavour by the ladys family who in the end managed to break off the match lassalle fought a duel with racowitza his rival and entirely by accident the princess assures us received a fatal wound she presently married the victor who had been thrown over in favour of lassalle he lived only a few months and the princess afterwards appeared on the stage wrote for the american newspapers remarried and got a divorce and remarried again she was a beautiful passionate and imperious person owing not a little of her temperament one imagines to that enraged father who

the countess cosel a romance of history of i the times of augustus the strong by joseph j kraszewski translated and edited by count s c de soissons downey  coof the 312 works chiefly novels produced by the polish writer kraszewski we believe  the jew is the only one which up to this time has been translated into english the present story however has enjoyed great popularity among the authors countrymen and it has been translated into both french and german perhaps the best thing which kraszewski has left is his story of jermola the potter which first appeared in 1857 anticipating by four years  silas marner which it greatly resembles this was an extraordinary coincidence for it is certain that the english author was unacquainted with the writing of her polish contemporary of the present work we may say that it is lively and carries the reader along with it the portraits of augustus ii and his great rival charles xii are vigorous and their supposed meeting at dresden is dramatically conceived  but the polish king is such a thorough scoundrel that we cannot make a hero of him we grow tired of him and his female favourites and are sorry that the countess cosel as she was called should have fallen under his influence the picture of the orgies of her drunken husband with augustus and his revellers is repulsive she is divorced only to fall into greater misery after a brief triumph and ends her days in prison the poor pole zaklika who loses his life for her is an interesting figure the book is illustrated with portraits and deals with an epoch which is not very familiar to the english reader who probably does not know much about augustus the strong and his skill in twisting horseshoes and bending iron bars as the one preserved in the museum of st petersburg testifies it must be confessed that kraszewski had a great deal of skill in storytelling he was a clever man all round and has left some good poetry perhaps we may remind our readers that by order of the german government he was arrested at dresden on a frivolous charge of treason and detained for some time in the fortress of magdeburg he died at geneva march 19th 1887,biography

thie otuardiain angel 4 it is not easy to discover the drift of this poemn and we incline to think that the author has stopped short of his original intention and presented his readers only with a fragtment but however this may be  the guardian angel  is a work of merit it is iin the form of a drama  and the purpose seems to be to show the infillence of a good woman over a nature of fierce impulse agnes the heroine while abroad has saved oliver from commmitting murder on his retura t wales he sees her again and appears anxious to marry her so as to have his guardiani angel always at his side but lhe falls over a cliff and dies  and whether adrian who is also in love with agnes marries her we are not told nor does it appear that her influence over oliver has been very effectual for he plainly intends to murder adrian a few minutes before he meets with his fatal accident thus the cliff over which he fell is better entitled to the name of the dramia than agnes herself and it seems rather due to his fall than to her that he dies in a christian state of mind the other poems are passable  thc guardian angel new novels by oliver wendell holmes 2 vols low  co to the more thoughtful and critical of those who are likely to peruse his new novel mr wendell holmes is at pains to set forth in a lengthy preface the purpose of the tale which relates to the character and doings of myrtle hazard in whose blood an element of rebellious wildness derived from an aboriginal indian ancestor is at war with the physical and moral forces which she inherits from her anglosaxon progenitors  i have attempted says the author  to show the successive evolutions of some inherited qualities in ihe character  of myrtle hazard not so obtrusively as to disturb the narrative but plainly enough to bc  kept in sight by the small class of preface  readers the novel that requires to be thus  explained in a preface is manifestly deficient in one of the most important qualities of a i good tale  and the worst that we have to urge  against the guardian angel is said when j we admit that without the authors considerate  preface we should certainly have failed to  apprehend his special design and that even i with the aid of his prefatory intimation we j are unable to see how his book is calculated  to effect his object like its precursor  elsie vernier the tale is termed by the author  a j study of reflex function in its highest sphere j by which term he fears that he may  frighten  away all but the professors and learned ladies j and though without laying claim to rank with j either of these two classes of severely philo j sophie readers we were in no way disposed to  tremble at his hard words we must confess j that when we found the story dull and inco herent they did not tend to influence our  judgement in its favour throughout the earlier chapters we were inclined to think well of the book and to hope that on working into the middle of the first volume we should take a strong interest in the passionate child whose peculiaritiesamply accounted for by the cheerlessness of her life and the severity of her training in a gloomy home and therefore by no means referable to the physical cause to which the author assigns themare sketched with force and delicacy but as the novel progresses to the end of its first half growing more devoid of  story  with every turn of a leaf the heroine loses all power over the readers imagination and by the time she has tunied out a commonplace schoolgirl in a fashionable college for young ladies she has altogether ceased to be in the slightest degree interesting as a psychological curiosity some of the subordinate personages of the drama are presented with cleverness for instance mr byles gridley ma the mild benevolent bookworm is so well managed that for the pleasure of watching his humorous nature and amiable disposition under circumstances more favourable to their display we could wish that mr holmes had put him on a better stage and given him a worthier part as well as worthier companions some skill and originality are also shown in the coarse delineation of the rev mr stoker who is for a time myrtle hazards religious adviser and ghostly enemy and of whom it is recorded  the rev mr stoker was a man of emotions he loved to feel his heart beat he loved all the forms of nonalcoholic drunkenness which are so much better than the vinous because they taste themselves so keenly whereas the other according to the statement of experts who are familia with its curious phenomena has a certain sense of unreality connected with it he delighted in the reflex stimulus of the excitement be produced in others by working on their feelings a powerful preacher is open to thc same sense of enjoymentan awful tremulous gooseflesh sort of state but still enjoyment that a great tragedian feels when he curdles the blood of his audience some of myrtles feminine companionsespecially her austere aunt miss silence withers and her loyal defender nurse byloeexhibit artistic merits that might almost be extolled for excellence but other characters of the story are just as poor and ludicrously insufficient for the purposes of romantic art as the better characters are commendable gifted hopkins the village poet is perhaps the weakest and most puerile piece oibad  work in the book  but in the portions of the tale  that do not specially relate to this butt for i  mr holmess satire there are characters and  i devices and pieces of descriptive writing that i  will occasion more surprise than gratification to  readers who have derived amusement from the 11 authors former works but of all its many   shortcomings the chief fault of the guardian i  angel is its almost total want of what is i j technically termed  story so singularly de fective is it in this respect that if mr 1 i holmes should ever be required to reissue the j  work in a second edition he would d well to i  prepare readers for its most conspicuous failing  by christening it the novel without a story,biography

the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity  the works of george meredith memorial edition vols ivl constable  co this memorial edition of merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use for the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciation  the works of george meredith 17 vols 6s each constable to fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  standard edition  of

peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath  your neighbour is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutysir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane  it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles  a more touching scene is that between sir charles pomander and mrs vanesir charles is in love with mrs vane  now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband pomander  what madam all alone here as in shropshiremabel for the moment sir pomander  force of habit a husband with a wife in shropshire is so like a bachelormabel sirpomander and our excellent ernest is such a favouritemabel no wonder sirpomander  few can so pass from the larva state of country squire to the butterfly nature of beau mabel  yes sadly  i find him changedpomander  changed transformed he is now the prop of the  cocoa tree the star of ranelagh the luuzun of the green roommabel  the green room  where is that you mean kindly sir but you make me unhappypomander  the green room my dear madam is the bower where houris put off their wings and goddesses become dowdies where lady macbeth weeps over her lapdog dead from repletion and belvidere soothes her broken heart with a dozen of oysters in a word it is the place where actors and actresses become men and women and act their own parts with skill instead of a poets clumsilymabel actors actresses does mr vane frequent suchpomander  he has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborn to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy  you would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a frienda friend  he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what cried he you recognised her you detected the actress of all work under the airs of lady betty modish lady betty modish cried mabel that good beautiful faceah cried sir charles i see you did not well lady betty was mrs woffingtonwhom my husband i know had invited here to present her with these verses which i shall take him for her and her poor little lip trembled  had the visit been in any other character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have i done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman  would he have chosen the day of my arrivalnot if he knew you were coming was the cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed  said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  my last letter written upon th roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly  read me the passage madam on which you argue1 poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish  i had but my husband and my god in the world cried she  my mother is gone my god have pity on me my husband does not love me there is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition the very clever scene in which mrs woffington imitates mrs bracegirdles acting and leads cibber to believe that the real bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as cibber was concernedwhat mrs woffington who had never seen mrs bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous apology  that this country has yet seen  the thing is impossible for cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last mr vane might have been

sketch ofthe life character and writings of baroness de staelholstein  3 v   by madame necker de saussure translated from the french bvo pp 30j london is 20 madame de stael was a lady possessed o such extraor dinary genius and splendid talents and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character cannot fail of being interesting the first of female writers perhaps of this or of auy age she not only possessed a commanding influence in france during the most eventful period of its history but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness and respected if not admired in every state of europe some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of madame de stael and passing over the knowledge of human nature the fidelity of observation and the acuteness of remark which she displayed in all her writings haye with a most fastidious delicacy carped at some passages which taken even abstractedly were never doubtful the present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman but a critical examination of her writings aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life and when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of madame de stael who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting we will not follow madame de saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works of madame de stael and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged  but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life which is the more interesting as it is the least known in u  general examination ofthe talents of madame de stael the author remarks   before she appeared religion and knowledge had their separate defenders these two grand causes have been pleaded as we may say in opposition each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas there has been in this respect a secret division among mankind one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason the other that of faith out of pure civility  madame de stael alone has embraced with equal zeal the party of knowledge and that of religion she alone has adopted from the bottom of her heart whatever was best in different ages combating on one side ancient prejudices and ignorance and on the other modern selfishness and incredulity   madame de stael loved what was about her and extended to human nature her affection for her friends what her style wants of minute finish is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse by the freshness ofthe inspiration if i may venture to use the term lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain that sparkles as it flows  but something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties there is a marked originality in each yet all bearing a similar stamp which is pe culiar to madame de stael t his peculiar stamp originates from her character from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions from those sudden bursts of indignation of compassion of haughtiness and also from her never ceasing to be a woman  this last is perhaps her secret charm she addresses herself as a woman to the reader and presents herself personally to him to tell him what passes in her mind and also in his own but she is aware that he would soon forget her being a woman if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him accordingly whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle she never overpowers him with her superioritv he never arrogates to herself any preeminence it seems as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs and she recited what was thus offered to her view  sometimes too she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman whose sight is a little indistinct she explains to him all he perceives confusedly and places him in a bright sunshine that he may see a little more clearly himself when she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths she says to him  do not be afraid you will be glad you have passed we shall soon get safe out of it constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him she brings herself forward to divert him by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives persons words faces accents attitudesdresses every thing in fact strikes her every thing is characteristic in her pictures she knows herself as well as she knows others and that blind instinct which so frequently determines us to like or dislike is in hera feeling founded on motives of which she gives a clear account  the precision of her views is such that we forget their extreme clelicacy she has no vain subtilty does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible but even thing l  enlarges under her hands lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point and it becomes so distinct to her that none of its bearings escape her notice but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong the importance of which is acknowledged thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications  the copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect take at a venture any three of her pages and three of the authors most abounding in wit we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in madame de stael not that she affects conciseness every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together and perhaps there are two manyperhaps certain phrases which are superfluous to the train of reasoning have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck the succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in madame de stael to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it she is the goddess of plenty she scatters from full hands corn pearls roses ribands and diadems we would jet nothing escape us because every thing is of value but we may be fatigued in collecting it  on the whole the works of madame de stael appear to belong to a new age they announce as they tend to produce another period in society and in literature the age of strong generous animated thoughts sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart she has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort rather spoken than written of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies unrestrained confidence and conversational sallies inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics of the passions and of society than studied rhetoric has ever done the second part of this work is entitled  social and domestic life of madame de stael and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light   the distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her the sentiment was one and the same in her and assumed the decided cast of her character much more than that of the different relations of life or the disposition of the persons she loved in her maternal and filial affection friendship gratitude all seemed love lhere was passion or at least emotion in all her attachments they appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind and they were naturally expansive ardent impetuous and even stormy not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in madame de stael but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society and often human indolence oppose to the enjoyments of the heart for a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments that did not express themselves like hers and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error when she judged of others from herself but her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting her love was conspicuous through her anger she never gave pain to another but because she felt more herself and you could not avoid pitying her even when she wounded you most severely the affection of madame de stael for her father evinced itself on every occasion by the most watchful attention on him during his life and after his death she conceived she had lost everr earthly comfort with him  1 it would be necessary to relate how every day passed with madame de stael if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart she never ceased to live with him she always felt herself protected consoled succoured by him she invoked him in her prayers and never did any occurrence that was fortunate for her take place without her saying ic my father obtained that for ne his miniature she always carried about her and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition she never parted with it except on one occasion very ill herself and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait she imagined that when her daughter lay in it would produce the same effect on her accordingly she sent it to her desiring her to look on it when she was in pain every old man too recalled her father to her mind and made aparticular impression on her to every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible and once when in the time of her persecutions an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity then common and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age she wras extraordinarily grieved at it  i am very silly said she to me  but what would you have he was kind he was old he sat at my table i altered my hours for him and all these things grieve me to the heart her bounty to the aged who stood in need of her assistance was immense the idea of their sufferings tore her heart and as true christians see jesus christ in all who are poor she saw her father in every man that was old her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent and although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards madame de genlis who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms yet when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of madame necker it was with the utmost difficulty she could be restrained from resenting it  there is great beauty in the thought of that basrelief which after the death of m necker madame de stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents an airy figure as if already beatified is drawing towards the skies another that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled and prostrate on a tomb madame necker her husband and her daughter are represented under this emblem which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal the motto of madame de stael might have been the following verse which she often repeated with emotion    o liberte de rome 6 manes de mon peer   o roman freedom manes of my father  madame de stael could not avoid forming many friendshins she whispered this sentiment almost at first sight and she was touched with the effect which she produced and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections  there are ninety dtgrevs fixed saul she in my affections ami only ten moveable she was always free in her remarks on her friends and spared none of though objects of her attachment   this continual appreciation of her friends not only every one but of each daily this appreciation made incessantly  their presence sometimes hutt them and led them to doubt her affection  with you we must submit to be judged it fresh cost every morning said ito her  what signifies it answered she  if i love thee more every pveningrnbc added  were i going to the scaffold v could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me in her habitual society madame de stael was full of charms in burr company there was no restraint thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person  she asked only for amusement not for trials of skill i she could not endure people to talk with indifference how can he expect me to attend to him she would ay  when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself  she could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller  that man talks only of himself but he does not tyre me hecuase i am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says   she had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing  she wa the naturalist observing a species as well as the orator that would persuade  but what deranged this study completely what took from her all interest in peoples words was affectation this tault which effaces every prominent feature which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom instead of the inunene variety of moral nature was profoundly tiresome to her ami scarcely less vexatious she expressed herself thus on ihe subject  there is never any such thing as a tele dtce with affected people the personage assumed makes a third and it is thlsthat answers when you speak to the otheraffected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned exaggeration too displeased her much  lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten she would say for the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility all natural feeling she remarked  have a degree of modesty  from a sketch of her conversation political opitnons and repartees we shall select a few of the most striking passages  when she was told of the follies of some witty man she would say f give him more wit and all these will van h one of her swedish friends observing to her  whatever von may say witty people commit a great many faults die answered  that is very true  but unfortunately stupid persons do the same though nobody thinks it worth while to ur  tice them another time she said  the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men  her attachment to france never abated not even ui i she had been banished from it ami incurred the enmity of its rulers i have a corroding grief respecting france she wrote  which 1 love more than ever and again  i have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that france but it must be confessed her country was more eset lally paris   show me the rue de bac said she once to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e i ac of geneva and its banks  i would willingly live at fris said she again  with a hundred pounds a j ear itt a lodging up four pair of stairs in 1806 when shepent four dtys ni paris in concealment her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night to view the streets by moonlight  i have a constancy of heart she wrote u and an inconstancy of mind for whick a country is formed where the scenes are incessantly renewing and where 1 have my old friends   it is very remarkable that always cutting to the quick in disputation always touching the most sensible points she always conciliated in her presence those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies you might be grazed be wounded in the contest but you always went away healed or at least she had applied balsam to the sore   you desire then my death or my dishonour said an emigrant to her in switzerland as he was going to the army on the frontiers  no answered she  what i wish is your defeat and yourglcry i would have you except being slain be like hector the hero of a vanquished army  the following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events  while she was in england in 1814 some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of paris which put an end to her banishment to these expressions of politeness she answered  on what do you compliment me pray on my being in the height of distress  it was from the date of the battle of leipzig that she began to be alarmed for france 4 in 1815 when bonaparte had already entered lyons a lady attached to his party came and said to madame de stael  the emperor knows madame how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes i hope answered she  he will know how much i detest him  during the hundred days she said  if all the declamatory phrases uttered this winter against the revolution had been enlisted we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the coth of march  in 1810 mr canning having thought proper to say to madame de stael in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bedchamber in the palace of the tuillcries  lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions madam france has submitted to u and we have conquered youyes answered sile  because you had all europe and the cossacs on your side but meet us tetedtete and we shall see she  said also to mr canning  the english nation is deceived  it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion  if it knew this it would renounce those who thus abuse its name   fiance said she  must remain as dead as long as it is occupied by foreigners first let us have independence and then think of libertv  she said of mr de bonald  he is the philosopher of antiphilosophy  but this will not carry a man very far   the ministerial party observed she  looks at the prosaic side of human nature and opposition at the poetical side this is why i have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter  some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures what would you have me say answered she he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality and he who has not should not accept a post of difficulty  in 1816 she said of the ministry  i do not like it yet 1 prefer it it is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses yet still it is a barrier  on occasion of the great number of persons enobled she said  it would be best to create france a marquis once for all l  she set no great value on puns yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness in a dispute on the slave trade with a french lady of high rank the latter said to her 4t what madam then you are much interested for the count of limonade and the marquis of marmalade why not as much as for the duke of bouillon  answered she  bonaparte having caused her to be told in 1815 that she must return to paris because he wanted her for the sake of constitutional ideas she refused saying  he contrived to do without a constitution and without me for a dozen years and he has now the same regard for the one that he has for the other even at this period however when any frenchmen passed by coppet in their way to join the army ofthe allies she endeavoured to divert them from their design not approving their endangering the independence of the nation even to acquire liberty  she was already dangerously ill when the  manuscript from st helena began to make a great noise in france notwithstanding the state of weakness to which madame de stael was reduced she made her children read the work to her and criticised it with all her strength of mind  the chaldeans worshipped the serpent said she the bonapartists do the same to the manuscript from st helena but i am far from sharing their admiration lt is but in the style of the notes ofthe moniteur and if ever i recover i think i can refute this writing with a high hand  r one of bonapartes ministers having desired her to be told that the emperor would reward her if she would attach herself to him she answered  i was aware that a certificate of being alive is necessary to the receipt of an annuity but i did not know that it required a declaration of love  notwithstanding the liberality and noble facility of madame de staels disposition great order was observed in the management of her house and estate so that her circumstances were constantly prosperous when under her government her mornings she devoted to business that is to the care of her property and to study and her evenings to society and to correspondence   the only luxury on which she set any value was the having accommodation for her friends and being able to invite to dinner persons with whom she wished to become acquainted  i have hired a cook that travels postsaid she  is not this exactly what i wanted to give dinners in dishabille throughout europe   the following anecdote is highly characteristic and displays madame de stael in a very amiable point of view   about twenty years ago when on a visit to me in the country it was proposed to play proverbs a sketch of marmontel entitled le barara the prater was selected in which a great lady ill and nervous consents to use her interest in favour of an old soldier who is soliciting a pension but on the express condition that he states his case to her in the fewest words possible the prater who is duly cautioned beforehand nevertheless indulges himself in such an exuberance of words that he exhausts the patience of his patroness and she will have nothing more to say to him madame de stael represented the great lady at first she acted her part very well she counterfeited languor to perfection next weariness then vexation and impatience but when the moment came for inflicting pain on the old soldier it was impossible for her to bring herself to this he had spoken of his wife and children he was at bottom one of the best men in the world it required too hard a heart to refuse him quitting therefore altogether her assumed character and totally destroying the point ofthe piece she told him with real emotion that in future he had better not talk so much but that for this time she would undertake his suit suclvin fact wat madame de stael she was not only incapable of giving pain to any person voluntarily but subject as she was to ennui she really felt none when she could be useful to others of her religious character we have the following account   among the happy effects of time on madame de stael 4 l  ii11 j  1  1     14t matta which had always looked to the consequences of her actions attached themselves more to their motives prayer that sentimental want of hers placing her incessantly in communication with the source of all excellence caused a pure light to penetrate her heart  whenever i am alone i pray said she to her children she wrote to me from sweden on the subject of mr de montmorency   there is no such thing as absence to the religious because they meet in the sentiment of prayer every moment we find in her letters a request to pray for her and her children  madame de stael thought it was pride in man to endeavour to penetrate the secret of the universe and speaking of the higher metaphysics she said  i prefer the lords prayer to it all during her long sleeplessness she was accustomed to repeat this prayer incessantly in order to calm her mind sighs certain exclamations that she was in the habit of uttering were with her pious invocations thus the following words that escaped her frequently  poor human nature alas what are we ah life life were religious sentiments venting themselves lu her last illness she was seen constantly exerting the virtues for which she was distinguished  and on the days when she suffered most pain she was employed in acts of kindness s she was heard to utter delightful sayings in her peculiar way t i have always been the same lively and sad she observed to mr chateaubriand  i love god my father and liberty  on quoting these words of fontenelle  i am a frenchman i am fourscore years old yet i never ridiculed the slightest virtue she added i can say as much of the slightest suffering  unquestionably she felt great regret at parting with her children and friends stoicism or the particular kind of enthusiasm that is capable of closing the heart to the pains of eternal separation entered not into her character her daughter in particular cost her many tears  with such treasures of affection she dictated for me in speaking of the objects of her regard  it is a sad thing to quit life  i should be very sorry she said likewise  if every thing were at an end between albertine madame de broglie and me in another world but she rather regretted life than really feared death she may have dreaded the last pangs an imagination like hers may have felt some horrors at the idea of physical dissolution terrible as it is to all of us  but death morally considered gave her no alarm she preserved so much tranquility as to wish to dictate to mr schlegel the description of what she felt her thoughts were always turned with hope towards her father and towards immortality  my father waits for me on the other shore she said she beheld her father with god and in god himself could see nothing but a father these two ideas were confounded in her heart and that of a protecting goodness was inseparable from both one day rousing from a state of reverie she said  i think i know what the transition from life to death is and i am sure that the goodness of god softens it to us our ideas become confused and the pain is not very acute  her confidence was not disappointed the profoundest tranquillity presided over her last moments long before she expired the grand struggle had ended and her soul departed gently it can scarcely be necessary to extend this article by any further remarks on madame de stael or on the present work that it is written with the partiality of a friend and an ardent admirer of madame de stael is avowed and yet there is scarcely an assertion or an opinion respecting her that has not already been justified or is so by the present volume this work is published in french so that those who may prefer reading it in the original will have the opportunity we may however observe that the translation is well executed,biography
sabrina warham the story of her youth by laurence housman murray 6s with this novel mr housman comes several steps nearer to his own but his own he has not reached so far as novels are concerned that is to say that strange piece of fiction to which he at length put his name  an englishwomans love letters seemed to contain evidence of a dual authorship influences were traceable but they were not allpervasive in a modern antaeus he appeared to be controlling the peh himself throughout but something of his natural freakishness seemed to have dropped off perhaps instinctively aware of incompatibility with the disguise its owner was assuming here and now there are indications of the development of the novelist in mr housman as he is to be the influence has remained supreme for the length of one book only and though it is still easily perceptiblelady berrers for instance delightful company though one find her is patently a stray out of meredithiait hats entangled itself inextricably with another influence equally potent and equally lneficent in moderation and all this sounds very unfair and even is very unfair until one remembers that mr housman has himself given us the right to claim absolutely individual work from him in fiction by his own achievements in other departments of letters east and west gill are indubitably hitherto unmarked spots in the map of wessex sabrina has a puzzling likeness to bathsheba fiverdene and david lorry to gabriel oak the scene in which roddie creeping close to the lighted window to decypher his belated love letter watchss the undressing and bathing of lotties child his own child sabrina giving it the attentions that should have come by right from its mother is an idyllic picture that could only be paralleled in the works of mr hardy but it would fit into almost any one of the wessex novels so as to deceive even the very elect  the small events big with the fates of men are wont to move the great artists in fiction to different emotions according to the mood in which they commonly observe with mr meredith even in his more sombre momenta we are never far removed from comedy with mr hardy a fantastic danse macabre lurks in the background even when his  comic relief his clowns are on the stage mr housmans genius is naturally allied rather to that of such a writer as hawthorne he has shown us in his poems his fairy tales his pendrawings an elvish strain that recalls donatello in  the marble faun and it is probably in this direction that the novels which shall be absolutely unmistakably his own will evolve themselves nevertheless whilst we still await his savoury meat we have enjoyed and thank him for his lentil pottage,biography
the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,biography
impzressitons of theophsrastu such by george eliot w blackwood  sons the interest which is felt when a distinguished cultivator of one branch of literature takes to the cultivation of another branch is a perfectly natural and legitimate interest there is certainly no reason why an excellent novelist should not be a good poet and still less reason why an excellent novelist should not write excellent essays a reader therefore may be pardoned who takes up the impressicm8 of theophrastus such with a pleasant anticipation of finding something good there it is not to be for gotten that george eliots special excellences in novel writing are such as might with reason be thought likely to enable her to write good essays of the moralist kind she has at any rate in her best novel work displayed in occasional reflections and apophthegms exactly the acuteness of observation and the power of expressing its results which the ethi cal essayist most needs and pearls are usually no worse for being strung in connexion instead of scattered at hazard it so happens too though perhaps this is a consider ation of a rather doubleedged character that we have very little essay work nowadays of the kind which england and france pro duced so abundantly between the middle of the seventeenth and the middle of the eighteenth century there is an immense amount of diluted matter of a not dissimilar kind published in weekly and daily journals and now and then a writer may attempt something more mature and concentrated in magazines and reviews but on the whole no collection of the british essayists is in the near future likely to go much beyond eliaalthough a smart journalist did remark the other day that the only reason for the popularity of lambs essays was that few people could do the thing then whereas if they had appeared today they would have been lost amid the superior work of the same kind now daily appearing that the reader who takes up theop7lastus such in such a mood as that which we have indicated is likely to be a good deal dis appointed may be as well said at once and frankly the author has attempted a form which is not an easy one and has not observed its limitations before we have got very far into the book and still more when we jay it down we feel that there is either too much or too little of mr such the essayist who wishes to utter his opinions through the mouth of a feigned personage must give him at least something of a body for our thoughts to take hold of mr such is little more than a disembodied shadow with a name attached to it and this being the case we feel that we could do without his shadow and his name altogether a more doubtful point is the adoption more majorun of fictitious but halfsignificant names for the minor characters introduced or discussed in passing there is perhaps something a little cumbrous about this to the taste of the present day but it is a matter of no great consequence the reader would probably be prepared to pardon a good many imperfections in the setting if the stones set were abundant of pure water and cut in a workmanlike manner it is however hereto drop the metaphor it is in the quality and wording of the thoughts it containsthat the principal weakness of the book consists the essayist has two different manners in which he may allowably and successfully put what he has to say there is the garrulous fluent and somewhat buttonholing manner and there is the manner in which the writer devotes his utmost energies to compressing and polishing his phrase till it has at least something of the pregnancy and of the brilliancy of joubert or of rochefoucauld there may be third fourth or fifth manners which are allowable but they have not hitherto been tried at any rate successfully in literature now we hardly think that george eliot has succeeded in working up her matter in either of these possible ways no one expects her to be easily garrulous but she might have been expected to be full and at the same time terse and clearcut there is too much in theophrastus stich to which these epithets can by no stretch of compliment be applied sometimes though it must be confessed not so often as might have been expected the fault lies in the use of unfamiliar and technical expressions when we are presented with such a pensie as the following  may there not be at least a partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a mans philo sophy is the formula of his personality  it must be a very dull or a very easy literary sense upon which the use of the word formula does not jar but there is not very much of this error a worse and a more frequent one may be best illustrated by a couple of quota tions  one wonders whether the remarkable originatorm who first had the notion of digging wells or of churning for butter and who certainly were very useful to their own time as well as to ours were left quite free from invidious comparisons with predecessors who let the water and the milk alone or whether some rhetorical nomad as he stretched himself on the grass with a good appetite for contemporary butter became loud on the virtues of ancestors who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow  nay whether in a high flight of imaginative sacrificeafter swallowing the butterhe even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of a generation more naive than his own  it has sometimes occurred to me when i have been taking a slice of excellent ham that from a too tenable point of view i was breakfasting on a small squealing black pig which more than half a century ago was the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise acknowledged by tie grudgingfarmer or dairyman who parted with him one enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward and such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham but since i have nevertheless eaten it the chief effect has been to moderate the severity of my radicalism which was not part of my paternal inheritance and to raise the assuaging reflection that if the pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my historical point of view they would have seen themselves and the rector in a light that would have made tithe voluntary now we are very far from thinking that there is nothing worth saying in these ponderous sentences but it is evident that the author instead of seeking to compress and point her thought has allowed it to bulge in any and every direction she has constantly inserted side reflections as they occurred to her regardless of the total effect and pitiless to the unfortunate reader who has begun a sympathetic grin and has to keep his muscles on the stretch for half a page before he is allowed to relax them she has reversed jouberts process and appears to be tormented by the ambition of putting a word into a paragraph and a para graph into a chapter and a chapter into a book this inability to stop when enough has been said is still more remarkable inl such a sentence as the following not that merman had a wrangling disposition he put all his doubts and queries and paradoxes deferentially contended without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the personality of homer expressed himself civilly though formally on the origin of language and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the socalled elementary substances his own total scepticism concerning manethos chronology or even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the outbreak of revolutionary tendencies surely george eliots demon must have whispered stop suggestivelyat homer imperatively at the origin of language and despairingly at elementary substances the sentence as it stands is not a witticism but a catalogue although however this fatal error per vades the book and deprives it of a claim to rank with essay work of the best kind the reader unless he is a very unreasonable person is not likely to think his time wasted or to complain that he is sent away empty no one of george eliots powers could pro duce reflections on subjects of interestand such are nearly all the matters touched upon in this volume  without those reflections being themselves interesting with the ast essay a vigorous apologia for the jews we have little to do here because it is entirely political in tone and hardly touches at all on the purely literary objections to the handling of the jewish element in daniel derondd the best of the essays beyond all question is looking backward a charming description with hardly any veil of the writers earlier days in the midland counties the description of english scenery on page 50 is equal to the very best thing she has ever done so again is the short episode of the manservant pummelled in  the watchdog of knowledge this delightful person who on being asked the cause of the tides answers well sir nobody rightly knows many gives their opinion but if i was to give mine it ud be different  and who is troubled to think of adams surprise at the assembled animals  for he was not like us sir used from a by to wombwells showswould redeem many times the number of dull pages or illconstructed phrases that are to be found in theophrastus such nor are there wanting abundant flashes of really terse and well oxpressed reflection elsewhere the political molecule who 1 occasionally sat alone in the same room with his books is not a person to be forgotten there could hardly be a betterput rebuke to cheap cynicism than this  if the human race has a bad reputation i perceive that i cannot escape being compromised anotherthe sea lion plunges and swims the more energetically because his limbs are of a sort to make him shambling on land  bears a strange likeness to the thought of a french poet on the albatross  ses ails de g6ant lempachent de

neither is exactly novel but both are vigorous and well worth reading on the whole then theophrastus such may be pronounced to be a book containing more good things than bad but spoilt by an insufficient attention to form and an insufficient recognition of its necessity it is never likely to be among the most popular of its authors books nor perhaps does it deserve this popularity but

new books the wrecker the somewhat clumsy c t of this story is not o a piece with mr stevensons other wor the prologue is an episode in a pacifc portarival of a ship 1anng of the skipper dinnerparty and gossip at the club s how i gatered that this captain was to tur out a repusie ruffian which was quite wrong he consents to tell his story but curiously the author proceeds to give it not as he then told it but ashe subsequently wrote it the r begins and the prologue and its characters totally di  leaving us in wonder why they were ever intd  te skeleton is this a castoff scion of our named carthew starts with five stangely d c fm sydney on a tadingcruise among the is on board a rotten little c thuis is ost and they take refuge on an atoll at last a brig the flyi ad ca in trea rescues them but the captain trying to ceat them of there 1mm wecr by r l sfsusa mi l o bmm gold a row ensues and they murder trent and his whole crew in trying to work the ship out they run her aground and before they have had time to efface the signs of the murders a manofwar appears they assume the identity of the dead crew and under their names are rescued and landed at san francisco they make their report the wreck is put up for auction and then they disappear all this is excellent and excellently told but alas how shortly three chapters only and those at the very end of the book i well on landing carthew hears that he has come into his estates and to prevent awkward discoveries gets an agent to run up the price of the wreck to a fabulous sum it is however secured by the hero dodd and his partner jim who stake their all on the venture naturally suspecting a hidden treasure of opium or gold dodd starts for the wreck in a strange state of detective exaltation here we are teased by a good deal of the usual gaboriau business the discovery of new clues the fitting in of missing links the reiterated pronouncements of the actors that they can make nothing out of it true the secret is well kept because as yet we have not had a word about carthew and his ship though of course we smell blood from the first but it is all the more worrying for that in gaboriau one always guesses about the second chapter what he is after and then the dues are quite easy to remember and one takes a sort of sardonic pleasure in the bungling and sapient wonderment of the poor dear detectives to properly grasp the wrecker you must read itover again for a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse the clues turn out all right in the end when the problem is solved and xoone mr carthew and a totally distinct and separate story till then it is just algebra well this replica of  treasure island ends tamely enough the flyixg scd is disembowelled and sunk but nothing of value beyond clues is found and dodd return to his partner and ruin having thus wound up the second part of the story the authors then set about the beginning how do they piece the head on to the tail  very simply dodd comes into money he is haunted by the mystery he feels a strange a very strange yearning for the unknown englishman who is somehow mixed up in it he knows a blackmailer is on the trail he will take a holiday by following the clues to england and warn the victim he tracks him to paris hears his story and they swear eternal friendship but unluckily we now feel less inclined to emba on a second or shall we boldly say a third  cruise to the same treasure island through the same seas and with comrades not wholly differing from our former crew it is a beautiful voyage most exciting most tragical it is the very cream of the book butit is only an appendix the lat chapter which is called an epilogue is singularly illadvised it assumes the form of a letter to mr w h low whose name is to my ignorance a name only mr stevenson not unfrequently takes a cruel delight in destroying our illusions and throwing cold water on the dying embes of the fire round which he has allowed us to sit here he begins by relating how the other day he came across his friend dodd who of course proceeds to wind up the story by giving the last news of the various characters but why this sudden intrusion of the author in the epilogue  in the prologue dodds story was told to a merchant named havens what is the object of this confused and confusing setting mr stevenson then in his airy coaxing way throws the whole fiction aside and professes to reveal the genesis of the storyhow he and his colleague resolved to work up some incident they heard into a popular cartbeforethehorse detective novel how keenly they appreciated the inherent defects of such a planthe defects which i have just been illustratingand how they hoped to disguise or palliate them by sundry devices but mr stevenson does not beguile me so easily he is no acquaintance of yesterday i have learned to catch the light shadows of feeling which flit across his sunny pages better than he thinks this is no epilogueit is an apology but of all acts an apology is about the most graceful and the most righteous though fools do not think so it mr stevenson were not a little wearied nay disgusted with his excursion into the realms of anical detectivism he would be no longer to my mind the author of prince otto once he has relieved our anxiety by hinting his contempt for the whole business he resumes his reign over us after all he has but done well what inferior hands can do much better but he should not have tried i would not for the world pit myself against a morning governess at compound division or mangnalls questions but to end thus churlishly i too should be but a wrecker and of the graceless literary breed for though mr stevensons last ship steers an unsteady course she carries a goodly freight there are dramatic scenes in this book which he has never yet surpassed and characters which stand out among his best these and other fine things let the delighted reader find out for himself two points only may be noticed from an advertisement i gather that mr lang is most impressed with the character of the captain which captain  there are several if he means nares i cannot agree with him i do not believe in the virtues of wicked men least of all in those of the farwestern cardsharping cutthroat nay why shrink from the degrading confession i believe there is more virtue in one bethesda of sleek anabaptist chandlers and their snoring spouses than in all the gambling hells of the golden gates we meet too many ruffians in the wrecker but one highly elaborated though somewhat neutral character it does present that of dodd the artist nature dragged into the vortex of coarse reality the other point is the grave and subtle satire on american institutions which underlies the fun of the earlier chapters the commercial academy may be an exaggeration but it is an instructive parable possibly here mr stevenson is indebted to others for the incidents and local colour but the style is clearly his own and reveals vet a new phase of his genius y y  literature the wrecker by robert louis stevenson and lloyd osbourne cassells in one of his early essays mr stevenson played with the charming fancy that the conduct of life depends upon skill in literature not indeed wholly but in a great measure it is no light task he insisted to communicate your precise sense of things in set phrase to another man the choice of words the nicety and exactitude of them may fail to impress your companion as you would have him impressed all speech all intercourse by word of mouth or by  hand of write is so much practice of the literary art and human converse is thus encompassed with peril the world was made before the english language and seemingly upon a different design suppose we held our converse not in words but in music those who have a bad ear would find themselves cut off from all near commerce and no better than foreigners in this big world but we do not consider how many have 4a bad ear for words nor how often the most eloquent find nothing to reply from the first this whimsical commonplace has powerfully influenced mr stevenson it has made of him an aesthetic casuist anxious about the veracity of his least word its minutest tone and accent be it a story a piece of criticism an essay in ethics a personal reminiscence or a private adventure each of his words is positively tremulous with its desire to tell the truth since the whole of life is a continuous and coherent affair he refuses to isolate literature in a secluded palace of art or bookworms study he wants to know life upon all sides and he wants to express it upon all sides by the use of words thus it is that his choice of an adjective his composition of a phrase or his disposition of incidents is for him an exercise in good conduct a trial of truthfulness we live in a very rich full world our behaviour in it and out attitude towards it expressed in words comprehend all matters of belief and conduct of modern writers only mr pater shares with mr stevenson this fine anxiety not to play life false by using inaccurate expressions he also whether he write essays or imaginative studies or more formal narratives shows this care for the truth as he apprehends it to mr pater an italian church or a french landscape an ancient liturgy or a classical rite is a thing with definite values of its own a thing with claims and rights towards which he has duties a shipwreck or a walking tour an american man of business or a french artist is the same to mr stevenson the one is more meditative more learned more gentle than the other but both are men who feel the pathos the heroism the living significance of thingsvirgils  sense of tears in mortal things  and brownings  how good is mans life the mere living  how flt to employ all the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy it is curious to reflect that many critics have found in mr pater and mr stevenson two intensely practical humane and sympathetic writerslittle more than unreal eclectic profundities intricacies and extravagances the wrecker contains as it were in solution all the perfections of mr stevenson upon the face of it it has all the stirring romance of adventure which we enjoyed in treasure island it displays two characters with all the impressive fidelity which made alan breck and the master of ballantrae so wonderful it includes episodes and sketches varieties of life such as those in the two books of travel in the silverado squatters and many single essays it has much of that fantastic humour which adorns the new arabian nights it provides us with more of those brilliancies of moral sentiment already so characteristic of mr stevenson the result is a delightful and imperfect book a saturn  farrago in which every reader can come upon something to his taste and no reader feels satisfied throughout the writers explain how it all came about in an ingenious epilogue or apology they determined one moonlit night in the pacific to write a story about the tale of a wreck often the occasion of a rascally romance in commerce  before we turned in the scaffolding of the tale had been put together but thc question of treatment was as usual more obscure we had long been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of though police novel or mystery story which consists in beginning your yarn anywhere but at the beginning and finishing it anywhere but at the end attracted by its peculiar interest when done and the peculiar difficulties that attend its execution repelled by that appearance of insincerity and shallowness of tone which seems its inevitable drawback they determined by a more artistic method by a gradual approach to the story making though chief character familiar from the first among many various scenes to give an air of reality to the central mystery to this end the story flies from muskegon to edinburgh from edinburgh to paris from paris to san francisco before the puzzle of the wreck in the pacific is introduced and to solve that puzzle the story flies from san francisco to dorsetshire and to barbizon where the answer is given the answer takes us to australia the pacific and san francisco once more i do not know that courtesy compels me to accept for literal truth the authors explanation but it is more convincing at least than poes account of his evolution of the raven in his essay upon the philosophy of composition to mr stevensons method are due at once the charm and the defect of the wrecker the charm lies in single episodes the bohemian life of art in paris the bohemian life of commerce in san francisco the splendid voyage to the pacific islands the search for treasure upon the abandoned ship and in certain characters pinkerton the tactless and romantic speculator  nares the brutal philosophical and cordial seaman but the central facts of the story are obscured by the very means employed to make them plausible and natural the story begins and ends with some lack of symmetry and rounded form the last details are told by mr stevenson propria persona in a letter of dedication to a friend it reminds us of scotts intricate prefaces introductions and involved machinery for getting his main story under weigh pleasant in themselves these contrivances do but embarrass the story which they are meant to serve in the present case the difficulties of the narrative are pardonable enough for they help us to realise that variety and richness of life which mr stevenson never wearies of praising it may be objected to this story that it contains episodes of brutal violence murder and bloodshedding which its author presents with a certain callousness if not with a certain gusto but mr stevenson himself supplies an answer by his constant trust in human nature to him every man has some nobility and we are all incomprehensible together captain nares was full of barbarity vanity illconditioned humours but  he won me to a kind of unconsenting fondness lastly the faults were all embraced in a more generous view i saw them in thoir place like discords in a musical progression tu ul accepted them and found them picturesque as we accept and admire in though habitable lace of nature the smoky head of though volcano or the pernicious thicket of the swamp though world is a pageant of vicos and of virtues to be endured by all means to bo enjoyed if may be our vices have something good in them and our virtuos are not all pure dodd though narrator of though story is grossly ungrateful to his strange lovable comrade pinkorton he writes him pages of penitence  wonderful are the consolations of literature as soon as that letter was written and posted the consciousness of virtue glowed in my veins like some rare vintage in though thick of a dangerous storm nares was happy well theres always something sublime about a big deal like that and it lund of raises a man in his own liking were a queer kind of beasts mr dodd bellaire a  shyster or disbarred lawyer with qualms of conscience goes to blackmail an unfortunate man dodd comments i used to wonder whether i most admired or most despised this quivering heroism for evil mr stevenson feels to the full what mr watson has expressed in four lines  momentous to himself as i to me hath each man been that ever woman bore  once in a lightning hash of sympathy i fdl this truth an instant and no more but with mr stevenson this truth is always present and it has preserved him from that easy contempt for whole classes of men which so many brilliant living writers lovo to express it is instructive to compare mr stevensons praise of a free natural life of work under sun and wind and rain with mr kiplings praise of a strenuous rapid active lifethe ona so simply honest and exhilarating the other so merely hitter and exasperating the two writers have something in common  mr stevenson make us interested in such things as a  deepwater tramp limejuicing around between big ports calcutta and rangoon and frisco and the canton river  mr kipling in such experience us loafing from lima to auckland in a big old condemned passengership turned into a cargoboat and owned by a secondhand italian firm yet the interest roused in us by mr stevenson is very different from that roused by mr kipling it is the difference between thn truth of pootry and though truth of bcienco behind mr stevensons writing there is a soul and a heart behind mr kiplings a good memory and a keen eye a detail recorded by mr stevenson has always some human interest it betokens moro than quick observation and mechanical experience it means that mr stevenson has been true to his pleasaut boase that he has never found life wholly dull nud vapid  that his sympathy with ail forms of life and all ways of men has made hint alort to notice the little details which go to compose them this is a brave book as confused as the iliad as adventurous as though odyssey and with no little of though

little journeys to the homes of good men and great by elbert hubbard g p f utnams sons it must be confessed that mr elbert hubbard has selected a most unfortunate title for his book it has about it a distinct flavour of the young mens christian society and conveys to the literary reader an entirely false impression of the nature of its contents as a matter of fact these twelve essays are particularly free from faults of the kind their illchosen title suggests jejune they are not neither are they amateurish indeed it is not to praise them too highly to say that they are free from conspicuous faults of any kind we receive another check in attacking the book almost immediately we open it it was a mistake to couple george eliots name with shaksperes treating the two as equals it was a mistake too to assume that george eliot occupies the place among women conceded by all the world to shakspere as a man it is true that when we challenge ourselves to instance her superiors we feel somewhat confused but this only emphasises the fact that at present at all events it is ridiculous to assume that in the aggregate there is anything like equality between men and women writers however we may let that pass it is a small fault and it is almost ungenerous to mention it as we dip deeper into mr hubbards pages the simplicity and grace of his narrative compel confidence he has the true instinct of compression and the skill to seize essentials he paints pictures for us with the directness of a degas but he infuses into them the idealism of a millet he tells the story of mary ann evanss association with george lews with sympathetic insight and completeness nothing extenuating and setting nought down in malice his description of hie stay at warwick of though inn there and of his walk over to nuneaton is written with cameolike distinction the present writer has made the same pilgrimage and in doing so he has communed in spirit with the essayist the writer next takes us into the company of thomas carlyle and his wife herein he shows that ho possesses the gift of sympathy and iosight into the complexity of human character i have never read a more understanding story of the relations between these two  jeannie welsh carlyle writes mr hubbard  bad oapacity for pain as r seems all great souls have she bufferedbut then suffering is not all suffering and pain is not all pain and again  his carlyles was a masculine mind the discrimination and subtle intuitions which are k found to be scattered through his pages like t violets growing among the rank swale of the prairies all these sweet odorous things came from his wife she gave him her best thoughts and he greedily absorbed and unconsciously wrote it down as his own the excellent taste of mr hubbards brief biography makes it of more value than many ponderous tomes written about carlyle the picture of john ruskin too if as vivid as it is characteristic incidentally it must be remarked that in this essay mr hubbard is betrayed into indulging in some cheap and inconclusive remarks on the nature of genius and on the position of the woman married to a man of genius his premises are wrong and bis deductions are false and the several examples upon which he bases his contentions are absolutely without point mr gladstones picture has been so often drawn that mr hubbard could not be expected to make his version of that manysided man stand out he gives us however an excellent sketch of chester and of a wellknown hostelry there but mr hubbard is at fault in speaking of lord brougham as a scotchman he prefaces his eulogium of turner wiih that sentence of ruskins which is more remarkable for the generous wholeheartedness of its praise than for its critical accuracy to speak of any work of turners as incapable of any improvement conceivable by the human mind is simply to descend into rhapsody however the responsibility for this extravagance may be born by mr ruskin the tale of turners early struggles is told with sympathy and knowledge for a long time his pictures were not popular  first the public says mr hubbard scorned turner next turner scorned the public in the beginning it would not buy his pictures and later it could not    for merit there is a recompense in sneers and a benefit in sarcasms and a compensation in hate this essay on turner is among the most illumined of the series  if swift says mr hubbard had possessed only his mothers merits without his fathers faults he would never have shaken the world with laughter and we should never have heard of him in other words no man is supremely great unless he has a dash of the devil in him and swift is certainly a striking example of this truth  his misanthropy as the writer remarks  defeated his purpose thwarted his ambition ruined his aims andmade his name illustrious for think what a small meed of fame would have been his had he achieved the summit of his desires and been enthroned as primate of england the profession of letters was hateful to him he despised it social precedence was his aim even more than political power the last was in his eyes a passport to the first but swift had not the patience to wait his stomach was too high to permit him to crawl into the office he coveted 4 to succeed in winning a bishopric requires a sagacity as keen as that needed to become a governor of new york the man bides his time makes himself popular secures advocates lubricates the way pulls the wires and slides noiselessly into place as a churchman swift was an erastian of the purest type he was as mr hubbard says  as incapable of spirituality as he was of the grand passion not an amiable man assuredly a man to respect perhaps but not to love frond severe cruel calculatingthere were no bounds to his ambition the philosophy which comes with years did not serve to allay the smart of his bruised and wounded spirit he was of the earth earthy a materialist and so far as essentials go a sceptic his undying literary creations wera evolved to give vent to his spleen that swift wai congenitally mad his recent biographers see fit to deny but to the present writer the denial seems to be based on grounds which only pedantry can accept his overweening vanity was the outcome of incipient madnees of which indeed it was a symptom mr hubbard tells a characteristic story of victor hugo what he had once written  down beelzebub and all his hosts could not make him change at a rehearsal of  hernani mlle man expressed a dislike to rn certain word and asked the author to change it  i wrote it and it must stand was his answer but mlle mars persisted in using another expression instead of the authors whereupon hugo asked her to resign her part the lady wept promised to adhere to the text and was reinstated fiftythree times thereafter she played the part and she did not once speak what the author had written  the moral of this is that even a strong man cannot cope with a small woman who weeps at the right time the next two essays those on wordsworth and thackeray are less effective thousands of pens have written about dickens but bis works and his haunts have rarely been treated more luminously than by the writer under consideration it would be difficult to commend too highly his lightness of touch or the philosophic tolerance with which he deals with his subject and in estimating dickenss place among the novelists of all time mr hubbard is as critical as he is just  the novelist says he  must have lived and the novelist must have imagination but this is not enough he must have power to analyse and separate and then he should have the good taste to select and group forming his parts into a harmonious whole it must be admitted that mr hubbards defence of dickens against his severest critics is scarcely convincing he tacitly admits that many of his characters arenot really alive but only seem to be  by rummaging he says  over the commercial world you can collect the harshness greed avarice selfishness and vanity from a thousand men with these sins you can if you are very skilful construot a ralph nicklcby a scrooge a jonas chuzzlewit an alderman cute a mr murdstone a bounderby or gradgrind at will a little more pride a trifle less hypocrisy a molecule extra of untruth and flavour with this fault or that and your man is ready to place up against the fence to dry mr hubbard discourses on dickens admirably and entertainingly and he says some acute things on his own account he thus sums up his qualities and limitations 44 he has a watch that starts in a way of its own never mind the sun he lets you see the wheels go round but he never tells you why the wheels go round he knows little of psychologythat curious unseen thing that stands behind every act he knows not the highest love therefore he never depiots the highest joy nowhere does he show the gradual awakening in man of godlike passion nowhere does he show the evolution of a soul very very seldom does he touch the sublime but he has given the athenians a day of pleasure and for this let us all devoutly give thanks after dickens goldsmith

the aran inlands by j m synge dublin maunsel 5s net the aran islands it is probably necessary to remind the ignorant saxon are three small islands lying off the west coast of ireland about thirty miles from galway the largest is about nine miles long and the inhabitants who are for the most part still strangely primitive gain their living by burning kelp fishing and tilling their scant fields though the soil is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed in the following year and the straw is all the profit of his four visits to these islands mr synge the author of the playboy of the western world the play that caused so much disturbance at the abbey theatre dublin has written an attractive book which while relating his experiences simply and without literary artifice is rendered charming by tne authors sympathy with the kindly men and women of whom he writes  mr synge has a fine eye for colour and he has painted a truthful though sombre picture of the islands with their grey clouds and grey seas and slaty limestone rocks the men dressed in indigo and grey and the women in red petticoats with grey shawls twisted round their heads there is little division of labour on these barren rocks  every man is a good sailor an expert fisherman sufficiently wise in agriculture to till his poor fields clever enough with his hands to make a cradle or a coffin they dwell in thatched cottages whose chief room the kitchen has an earth floor and open rafters and two doors facing each other one open and one shut according to the wind in this room the men sit on the wet foggy days that are so frequent on these desolate islands drinking perhaps the grey poteen in a haze of turf smoke and listening to the wonderful tales of the old men or talking endlessly of tides and fish and the price of kelp in connemara but in all the speech of this simple folk there sounds a note of despondency a sadness of things passing for their growing sons leave the islands nowadays for america or the mainland unwilling that like their fathers before them they should spend their days in snatching a poor livelihood from the winds and the sea even here the gaelic seems to be dying out and the younger men are no longer ready to believe in the fairies whose strange hatred of the human race colours so many of the stories that mr synge has collected from the old men of the islands progress which may not spare either beauty or simplicity is reaching these primitive men and women at last and we therefore owe a double debt to mr synge for having written this book before it was too late and for having written it so well mr j b yeats contributes some clever illustrations,biography
  father and son a study of two temperaments heinemann this anonymous book is one of the most fascinating and interesting pieces of literature that has been issued of recent years were we not in the preface to it specifically informed that the narrative  in all its parts     is scrupulously true we should have judged it to be fiction by a skilled hand founded upon fact and personal experience but either way as unadulterated fact or unadulterated fiction it is as the author offers it to us a document of the highest value though strangely enough not so for the reason advanced by the writer who claims that it is a  record of educational and religious conditions which having passed away will never return  a diagnosis of a dying puritanism this stifling joyless creed is neither dead nor dying it is today a power in the land indeed a prominent puritan not long since urged upon us that it was the backbone of the nation and was not a little annoyed when we retorted that if so  the nation was suffering from spinal disease the puritans we have always with us and their creed admirably summed up in the following quotation is the same now as it was in the beginning it divides heart from heart it sets up a vain chimerical idea in the barren pursuit of which all the tender indulgent affection all the genial play of life all the exquisite pleasures and soft resignations of the body all that enlarges and calms the soul are exchanged for what is harsh and void and negative it encourages a stern and ignorant spirit of condemnation it throws altogether out of gear the healthy movements of the conscience it invents virtues which are sterile and cruel it invents sins which are no sins at all but which darken the heaven of innocent joy with futile clouds of remorse there is something horrible if we will bring ourselves to face it in the fanaticism that can do nothing with this pathetic and fugitive existence of ours but treat it as if it were the uncomfortable antechamber to a palace which no one has explored and of the plan of which we know absolutely nothing the book is the story of the struggle between two temperaments the fathers and the sons the father is a plymouth brother of the sternest strictest blindest type the mother who dies while the son is yet a child is equally fanatical for example to her every work of fiction is simply a lie the father is a zoologist of high standing and considerable fame not a little troubled for a time by the contradiction of genesis by science the mother bequeaths the son to her husband as one of the lords anointed and as destined to devote his life to the propagation of extreme puritanism the remainder of the book is devoted to the mental autobiography of the sons boyhood and youth all the characters are drawn with extreme skill and the picture of the small group of brethren in a little devonshire village is pitiable in its accurate dissection of narrow bigotry and selfsufficient blindness is not this a perfect touch this point concerning the father and his praying aloud over the son  i cannot help thinking that he liked to hear himself speak to god in the presence of an admiring listener these folk love to be familiar with the deity without the slightest intention or sense of irreverence there are revival scenes too painted soberly and with unfailing accuracy but we cannot follow our author when he sets forth that he is depicting a dead past fanaticism and puritanism vary in externals from age to age but in essentials remain the same we have neither space nor would it be profitable to attempt a detailed analysis of the book it must be read to be understood and appreciatedbut we will give one more quotation a passage which seems to us to sum briefly and ably a great subject it will i suppose be admitted that there is no greater proof of complete religious sincerity than fervour in private prayer if an individual alone by the side of his bed prolongs his intercessions lingers wrestling with his divine companion and will not leave off until he has what he believes to be evidence of a reply to his entreatiesthen no matter what the character of his public protestations or what the frailty of his actions it is absolutely certain that he believes in what he professes various famous men flit across the pageskingsley huxley robert louis stevenson sheridan knowleshistoric events play their part and had we the inclination the writers claim to be a narrator of fact could easily be checked but as we have said it boots not whether the story is fact or fictionit is true to life the author also challenges the reader to  recognise him as an old acquaintance occasionally met with in quite other fields the secret has not been kept for long and we understand that mr edmund gosse does not deny that he is the writer of the book it is a great book but for our part we scarcely like this close anatomisation by a son of a father,biography

air miidshiipman easy by the author of peter s1mpli 3 vols post 8vo saunders  otley captain mairiyat is a deserved favourite of the public the many works which he has presented for the perusal of the novelreading woril have all been decided hits and have wvon for him the reputation of being our best seanovelist the good qualities of his books up to the appearance of the present volumes have been progressiveand consequently from the author of peter simple very much was expected  nor indeed whatever blemishes the candid reviewer must point out has the hope been dlisappointed the tale is neither so full of incident nor are the characters drawn with that forcenor indeed is the whole so well finished as peter simple  but waith the exception of our favourite we have great pleasure in stating our conscientious opinion that mr midshipman elasy is the best of the authors novels captain marvatt is not like mano of his tribe of litterateurs who write merely to amuse without a moral object each of his books has a distinct end in vice  and in each he has considered a novel as a channel through which wholesome advice may be conveyed in a palatable form and there is reason to believe that his writings have not only amused the public but have also lone no small good to the navy whether or not  out and out radical notions are gaining ground in the service we pretend not to know if the alolbinlations of radicalism are tainting the middies all well and good  the e quality mania must be written down but if not why the gallant author has raised up a mans ot straw in order to knock him down but to tell the truth we suspect him of aiming his shafts at civil as well as naval politics oh fie captain marryatthis is too bad  but to the story the hero jack leasv is the son of a wealthy country gentleman imbued with the revolutionary notions of equality which prevailed in england at the close of the last century which of course he is made bv the author to express in so absurd and unlimited a manner as to make the reader laugh at mr easys expense jack as tiresome and obstinate a little brat as ever sucked of a wet nurse imbibes from his father at a very early period all his peculiar notions of equality and it requires all the hard discipline detailed in these three volumes to knock them out of his noddle his first acquaintance with schooldiscipline would it is reasonably supposed have opened the youngsters eves but no not even his acquaintance with the watchdog the bull and the beehive while robbing an orchard to the fruit of which in arguing the point he claims an equal right with the owner nor his ducking in the fishpond when caught poaching on a neighbours property are sufficient to convince master jack of the untenableness of his position the theory of equality not being satisfactorily proved on land as far as his experience goes he determines to try its truth at sea and he accordingly asserts to his father his right on the principle of equality of determining his own profession the  point is argued and jack prevails by influence with a captain fortunately for jack under pecuniary obligations to mr eiasy he is appointed midshipman on board the harpy and in due time he makes his way to portsmouth after enjoying his notions of equality by spending his money like a lord for three weeks and after insulting the first lieutenant of his own ship one of the best scenes in the book he goes on board and while in the service meets with a variety of adventures particularly in the mediterranean on board in engagements and on shore all of which tend to prove the invalidity of his favourite point jack on the whole is a lucky fellow with his vltra notions to escape mastheading or the bilbos he gets married in the end to donna agnes a spanish lady whom he had once released from a prize ship and afterwards fallen in love with at palermo mr easy senior becomes starkmad with the equality mania and dies jack succeeds to eight thousand a vear leaves the navy and becomes a country gentleman and a conservative there are some admirably humorous scenes in these volumes which might be extracted if our space allowed and we did not wish to forestall the readers lleasure jacks learning his alphabet withhis nother and afterwards with the schoolmaster the first interview between him and the lieutenant biggs ad venture at gibraltar illustrative of  duty before decency and the duel scene at malta are perhaps the best but there are many others at which we have laughed incontinently the best drawn characters are mesty quite a bijou in his way although a black diamond easthupp the pursers steward ci devant pickpocket talbovs the mathematical gunner and gascoigne the firm friend and ally of easy the foreigners are we think rather a failure after pointing out so much that is excellent in mr midshipman easy we mnay safely take up the pen to make some strictures on the book we do not go the length of saying with one of our great men that he who would make a pun would pick a pocket but we detest puns except after dinner when a few glasses of wine have made us very amiable and easy to please written puns are absolutely intolerable need it be said that such wretched traps for horselaughers are quite unworthy of the acknowledged talents of captain marryat i but a much graver charge is that of representing the roman religion and its priesthood in an odious light such bigotry is now quite pase and can only serve to disgust the intelligent reader and injure the captains credit the most rabid orangemen could not paint more revolting scenes than are here given of the foul conduct of the romish priesthood the author may have his own opinions on these matters and we will not argue the point but we question the good taste of dragging them before the public in a work of fiction those of our readers who enjoy hearty merriment must read these volumes  mr midshipman easy literature notices of new works by the author of  peter simple  ja cob faithful c 3 vols this is a beautiful personification of a principle a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown as in a multiplicity of mirrors hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity had mr midshipman easy existed he must per force have acted precisely as captain marryat has made him act and that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service all who know that noble service will testify though the midshipmen kanya who have appeared on his majestys books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this mr midshipman easy par excellence occupies in captain marryats we have given in a long extract in our preceding number a specimen of what this exciting novel is it was the opening of the tale and with the sliest humour and in the blandest style covereel the most hiting satire of this almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit of which not one two but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force the paternal mr kasy having allowed his goodnature to run to seed which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania carried out even to the agrarian law anel a community of goods becomes as such a person infallibly must a madman abroad and a tyrant at home though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow the expression is pretty though a little used and something sharper than thorns elsewhere and everywhere else he still follows it out as all other democrats do until it interferes with his own convenience and at length notwithstanding the junior easys assertions to the contrary the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school this part of the story which is not at all maritime but strictly natural and highly amusing will be found philosophical also now the embryo mr midshipman easy inherits from his worthy father a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent this leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations out of which he always extricates himself with glory owing to the sound principle upon which he always acts of taking things easily should he be on the horns of a bull or of a dilemma no fear for master easy he will contrive to lip himself off softly from the one without a broken bone and to extricate himself honourably from the other by making an easy cushion between them from which to combat his adversary but as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united like the roman conquerors of old they resolve to divide the world between them old easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth vonni kasy all those who reside on the waters with a shamefully ample allowance the latter goes to sea as a midshipman then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence thc reader may suppose that at first in endeavouring to take all things easy he of that name finds it goes hard with him no such tliintr he is imperturbable command him he argues the case and produces his minorreprove him he argues the case still and produces his majorwell he is still unconquered  then to wind up the debate his superior officer proceeds to punish himbut he is not beaten  he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises and ultimately proves himself to be in the right by taking his punishment easily but the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall with all his whimsies do himself great honour and his country some service by mr easys maimer of thinking and acting he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel but his many droll and highly interesting adventures gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles by teaching him that in this ever shifting world everything will ultimately find its own level worth and activity rising vice profligacy and stupidity sinking to the depths of their natural degradation lu fact mr easy though always liberal becomes very gentlemanly and a good tory leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed  for mr easy senior not having been to sea to gain wisdom goes on from bad to worse from the whimsical to the extravagant and from the extravagant to thc insane all this part of the tale is a melancholy but a true picture of our fallible natures the love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of madame de staels aphorism that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man but captain marryat has contrived to make his midshipmans episode a very exquisite one the naval scenes as usual with this author are glorious the storm the fight the imminent danger are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master the delineation of the various characters that act with mr easy are also first rate what a troop of creations has this writer called forth we will not use the cant of criticism and say as that cant too frequently does this is the last and best of his works it is not better than  peter simple nor better written than  jacob faithful or a more true picture of life as life really is than  japhet in search of a father each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself which excellence could not by any possibility belong to the other midshipman easy is inferior to none of captain marryats preceding works  we think that the world will prefer it to any of them  but this preference ought not and will not throw his other productions into shade we shall conclude our remarks by saying that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country not merely originated one to be improved by othersand the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas over which we hope that england may be for ever

entitled  the souls destroyer appeared the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken the book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of william h davies we learned just enough to whet our curiosity we learned for instance that the new poet was a onelegged man who lived in a common lodginghouse somewhere in southwark that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s a week and that most wonderful of all he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense this sounded promising  but like oliver twist we wanted more at length mr davies has taken pity on our ignorance he has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life and a marvellous record it is  in these days incident having deserted the region of fiction is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary certainly  the autobiography of a supertramp we like not the title by the way it is too slavishly shavian contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by say mr rolf boldrewood its author has tramped it up hill and down dale  he is equally at home on the highroads of america or in the slums of our english cities he has known the agonies of starvation and by dint of considerable practice has acquired the difficult art of begging his companions have been thieves vagrants and mendicants not since borrow it seems safe to say have we had a presentment so vivid forceful and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people and the strange thing about it all is that mr davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books he has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song and with an eye always on the end of wanderingthe happy haven that awaits the tired voyager it is difficultindeed it is almost impossibleto quote from this volume so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter but one incident in this odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded the scene is america mr davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad they were each fined five dollars by the judge hot with indignation davies refused to disgorge a cent the remainder must be told in his own words  judge stevens looked at us steadily for a time and then asked this astounding question boys how much are you prepared to pay brum who had very little sense of justice and being such a good beggar set very little value on money asked the judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us if i had been alone at this time i would have paid nothing but to save brush from going to prison who i knew would support me through all i satisfied myself that if the judge approved of this amount i would pay it without further comment the judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously and then cried with a magnanimity that was irresistible  pass over the dollars boys  you shall have a chance this time as a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression together with its entire freedom from cant make it in every sense

literature more leaves from the journal of a life in the highlands from 1862 to 1882 smith elder  co it is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be the twenty years with which the journal has to do was indeed an eventful period it was marked by such important incidents as thc francogerman and russoturkish wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves but with these matters the journal is altogether unconcerned it deals solely with the queens life in the highlands and though it is quite natural that her majestys subjects should wish to know what were the queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it it records no thrilling adventures a carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the journal offers to its readers the interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective we look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her as a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray though selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect an art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic and the special value of the queens journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour in these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects it is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the queen is so fond of scotland this book answers the question it is because there and especially in the highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity the queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of though house of stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors heredity asserts itself mr galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone for we arc insensibly reminded of king george iii farmer george when wo read the queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping but although the journal recounts the queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied but we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern the book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author charles j robinson

that hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be born by all to whom it comes how will the queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of st pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the queens consort had died at windsor this book contains the answer to that question its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope of the queens personal character the volume contains naturally enough many indications that character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will it was so in those early days of her sovereignty when lord melbourne told the queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could eve happily i for long without a mans arintb rest on and when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero this womanly trait is obviously a key to the queens intimacy with dr norman macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered though tribute of an i abundant gratitude a keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that principal campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of though statue of the prince consort at aberdeen when it rained in torrents in other places the manifest sincerity saves everything the book contains some few indications of the queens taste in literature we gather that she is a warm lover of scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the duchess of saxecoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell scotts stories  to prince albert and his brother the  queen herself appears to be familiar with scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j we are told that brown gave her a copy of the poems of the ettrick shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things it is said in various places that lady churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books this is to be regretted though anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure a similar silence is observed with respect to the queens tastes in the arts wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte that her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence it is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is though sole business of the book to present but while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the queen must have thought and written frequently the following passage on a visit to abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to abbotsford the wellknown residence of sir walter scott it lies low and looks rather gloomy mr hope scott and lady victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present duke of norfolk with their children the young duke of norfolk and some other relations received us mr hope scott married first miss lockhart the last surviving grandchild of sir walter scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of sir walter they showed us the part of the house in which sir walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his ms of ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx sir walter had himself collected then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of sir walter in the study we saw his journal in which mr hope scott asked me to write my name which i felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others we went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are sir walters last clothes we ended by going into the diningrcom in which sir walter scott died where we took tea in this connexion it may be mentioned that when the queens uncle and early guardian leopold king of the belgians travelled in scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the princess charlotte he was for a few days the guest of sir walter scott at abbotsford while there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way an aged scotch divine alluded to the fact that though king was descended from frederick the wise elector of saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the reformation and to become a protector of martin luther thereupon leopold said that he felt more honoured by though mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay the relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the queen herself says in these  leaves of the strong protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of scotland her majesty s love of the highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment that she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough above all things the queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to carlyle goethe was the first to say  come let us make a description it will be remembered that the passages of the queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her majestys visits to poor highland women there was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to though queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman the present volume contains two such peep into highland life and the one we quote fresents us with though last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow grant on sunday august 22 1869 i went to see old mn grant whom i was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and i fear dying of dropsy on august 20 i again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way i took her hand and held it on the 27th she died on the 28th i stopped at her cottage and went in with louise and leopold we found all so clean and tidy but all so silent mrs gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death she had on the socks i gave her the day before yesterday she was in her eightyninth year probably the most enjoyable of these  leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the highlands here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep at a quarter to twelve i drove off with louise and leopold in the waggonette up to near the  bush the residence of william brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep this is a practice pursued all over the highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man james brown my shepherd though elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then william and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry to the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tyre and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough a very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping it was a very curious and picturesque sight more pathetic is the following  tuesday june ll 1872  brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time i was dreadfully shocked it was the child of a man named rattray who lives at cairnnacraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper abercrombies house not far from monaltrie farmhouse in the street at a little before five set off in the waggonette with beatrice and janie ely and drove along the north side of the river we stopped a little way beyond tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest they were searching everywhere while we were there the ol grandmother catenach by name who lives at souttar hole came running along in a great state of distress she is rattrays mother we drove on a little way and then turned round we heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at monaltrie burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below mrs pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the dee this burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen the little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the dee and carried along too dreadful  it seems from what i heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one we drove back and up to mrs grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  wednesday june 12  drove up to the bush to warn mrs william brown never to let dear little albert run about alone or near to the burn of though danger of which she was quite aware she said her husband william had started off early at three this morning some people went down to abergeldie and as far as the girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle no word of the poor child being found all were to start early to search that the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the queens domestic life in truth her majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment so long ago as the year of the queens accession the marquis of londonderry writing to the duke of buckingham said i hear melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection thia fact her premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience that these  leaves contain much moro about mr john brown than about lord beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise the book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers naturally enough brown became essential to the queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy it is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of browns robust independence and simple usefulness we do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship,biography
  father and son a study of two temperaments heinemann this anonymous book is one of the most fascinating and interesting pieces of literature that has been issued of recent years were we not in the preface to it specifically informed that the narrative  in all its parts     is scrupulously true we should have judged it to be fiction by a skilled hand founded upon fact and personal experience but either way as unadulterated fact or unadulterated fiction it is as the author offers it to us a document of the highest value though strangely enough not so for the reason advanced by the writer who claims that it is a  record of educational and religious conditions which having passed away will never return  a diagnosis of a dying puritanism this stifling joyless creed is neither dead nor dying it is today a power in the land indeed a prominent puritan not long since urged upon us that it was the backbone of the nation and was not a little annoyed when we retorted that if so  the nation was suffering from spinal disease the puritans we have always with us and their creed admirably summed up in the following quotation is the same now as it was in the beginning it divides heart from heart it sets up a vain chimerical idea in the barren pursuit of which all the tender indulgent affection all the genial play of life all the exquisite pleasures and soft resignations of the body all that enlarges and calms the soul are exchanged for what is harsh and void and negative it encourages a stern and ignorant spirit of condemnation it throws altogether out of gear the healthy movements of the conscience it invents virtues which are sterile and cruel it invents sins which are no sins at all but which darken the heaven of innocent joy with futile clouds of remorse there is something horrible if we will bring ourselves to face it in the fanaticism that can do nothing with this pathetic and fugitive existence of ours but treat it as if it were the uncomfortable antechamber to a palace which no one has explored and of the plan of which we know absolutely nothing the book is the story of the struggle between two temperaments the fathers and the sons the father is a plymouth brother of the sternest strictest blindest type the mother who dies while the son is yet a child is equally fanatical for example to her every work of fiction is simply a lie the father is a zoologist of high standing and considerable fame not a little troubled for a time by the contradiction of genesis by science the mother bequeaths the son to her husband as one of the lords anointed and as destined to devote his life to the propagation of extreme puritanism the remainder of the book is devoted to the mental autobiography of the sons boyhood and youth all the characters are drawn with extreme skill and the picture of the small group of brethren in a little devonshire village is pitiable in its accurate dissection of narrow bigotry and selfsufficient blindness is not this a perfect touch this point concerning the father and his praying aloud over the son  i cannot help thinking that he liked to hear himself speak to god in the presence of an admiring listener these folk love to be familiar with the deity without the slightest intention or sense of irreverence there are revival scenes too painted soberly and with unfailing accuracy but we cannot follow our author when he sets forth that he is depicting a dead past fanaticism and puritanism vary in externals from age to age but in essentials remain the same we have neither space nor would it be profitable to attempt a detailed analysis of the book it must be read to be understood and appreciatedbut we will give one more quotation a passage which seems to us to sum briefly and ably a great subject it will i suppose be admitted that there is no greater proof of complete religious sincerity than fervour in private prayer if an individual alone by the side of his bed prolongs his intercessions lingers wrestling with his divine companion and will not leave off until he has what he believes to be evidence of a reply to his entreatiesthen no matter what the character of his public protestations or what the frailty of his actions it is absolutely certain that he believes in what he professes various famous men flit across the pageskingsley huxley robert louis stevenson sheridan knowleshistoric events play their part and had we the inclination the writers claim to be a narrator of fact could easily be checked but as we have said it boots not whether the story is fact or fictionit is true to life the author also challenges the reader to  recognise him as an old acquaintance occasionally met with in quite other fields the secret has not been kept for long and we understand that mr edmund gosse does not deny that he is the writer of the book it is a great book but for our part we scarcely like this close anatomisation by a son of a father,biography
if i were king lunn ha 1 by justin huntly mccarthy heine mann gs mr mccarthy cannot in any real sense he said to have made a study of villon isle gives us certain historical facts and weaves about them a narrative wellconstructed melodramatic briskbut the book has no psychology now it is precisely the psychology of villon which should appeal to the artist as the psychology of ferdinand lassalle appeared to mr meredith when he wrote tl ie tragiccomedians there is really no reason why villon should be the hero of this story any sentimental rascal would have done just as well the quality of villons rascality and sentiment mr mccarthy does not succeed in conveying to us and katherine de vaucelles is no more than a figure moving prettily in stage gardens and the like places in a word if i were king is a story of pose of crude colour and of superficial sentiment indeed the sentiment throughout is cloying and sometimes almost nauseating to write  the cup of her heart seemed to run over with red tears is frankly to write nonsense of a particularly objectionable kind and there is much more of the same sort but we have no doubt that to many readers if i were king will make quite a strong appeal they will not however be readers who know villon at first hand to them the book will hardly count  if i were king by justin huntly j mccarthy hei nemann it would be superfluous to judge mr mccarthys novel from an historical standpoint since the characters whom he introduces are bent entirely to the authors own ends and are historical in little else than name his portrait of louis xi may be sufficiently striking to impress those readers whose knowledge of the cynical sovereign is not too intimate b ut it requires more than mr mccarthys undeniable brilliancy of narrative and picturesqueness of detail to enable us to recognise in the highsouled gentleman who as grand constable of france for one short week saves his country and wins the love of the lady katharine de vaudelles the sordid unscrupulous rogue whose rhymes alone have redeemed the memory of villon from the stigma of complete ruffianism mr mccarthy in his anxiety to present a vivid picture of the fircone tavern and its frequenters errs on the side of unnecessary coarseness but the story is certainly not wanting in melodramatic incident and for this reason is probably better suited to the stage  which it has already reachedthan to a form of literature demanding serious criticism of another kind,biography

the hand of ethelberta thc hand of ethelberta by thomas hardy in two volumes london  smith elder and co if you asked anybody during the progress of mr hardys novel through the cornhill how they liked the story you generally received an uncertain and qualified answer all admitted that it was very clever and original not like any other novel they had ever read but most people added that they thought the character of the lady as well as her adventures too improbable they would not believe that such a woman ever existed or could exist and granting the possibility of the character there were many of though incidents which struck them as extremely unlikely departures from the course of real life improbability has been the main fault alleged against the  hand of ethelberta in current criticisms of the story now we have always been among the enthusiastic admirers of mr hardys work recognising in it the very highest artistic purposes and something not far short of the highest powers of execution and we venture to think that this accusation of improbability as a fault proceeds upon a misapprehension of the writers intentions we do not of course presume to dictate what is to be considered probable and what improbable this is eminently one of the points on which a critic has no right to interfere between the novelist and his reader and would find no profit in interfering the reader may always legitimately decline to take any critics opinion as to what he ought to believe to be possible and if the reader pronounces a story improbable and declines on that ground to approve of it the novelist has failed he has failed that is if he intended to produce an impression of probability here the critic in the exercise of his chief function of discovering and explaining the intentions of the novelist may lawfully intervene if the novelist did not intend his story to be a reflex of real life he cannot be blamed if it is not unless we are to lay down  close adherence to the probabilities of real life as an indispensable condition of novelwriting mr hardy seems to us to have deliberately disclaimed being tried by a rigid standard of probability when he adopted as the subtitle of his work a comedy in chapters true there is a comedy of manners in which to be improbable is to fail because its design is to produce an illusion of real life it has recently been argued in these columns that probability is one of the tests by which the comedy of manners is distinguished from the farce but there is another sort of comedy what may be called ideal comedy in which the fancy is permitted to range beyond the limits of real life mr hardys  ethelberta  a comedy in chapters is a comedy of this sort characters and incidents are deliberately and consistently deflected from the perpendicular of real life to gratify the humour of the comic muse the incidents in  ethelberta are improbable as the incidents in shakespeares comedies are improbable it is a work of art pervaded by a dominant sentiment which colours every incident and every character whatever maybe thought of the interest of ethelberta as compared with  far from the madding crowd it certainly shows no falling off in intellectual force there is not a trace of hasty work in  ethelberta  its dialogues its descriptions its general proportions are as thoughtfully calculated and firmly worked out as a dutch painting of the old school not that the novel is dull and laborious on the contrary it is full of life and spirit bright all through with the sunshine of humour and fancy the novelist has been at pains to conceal his painstaking and has succeeded but mr hardy undertook a difficult task in trying to work out such a conception as the character of the heroine ethelberta  he burdened himself with a very subtle and intricate psychological problem the startingpoint of the story he gives in a brief formal prologue in the first chapter younp mrs petherwin stepped from the door of an old though popularlnn in a wessex town to tike a country walk by her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen  but as a fact not generally known her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood she was a respectable butler s daughter and began life as a baby christened ethelberta after an infant oftitle who does not come into the story at all having merely furnished to ethelbertas mother a means of occupying herself as head nurse she became teacher in a school was praised by examiners admired by gentlemen not admired by gentlewomen was touched up with accomplishments by masters who wero coaxed into painstaking by her many graces rather than by her few coins and entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof was stealthily married by the son he a minor like herself died from a chill c night during the wedding tour and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by sir ralph pethcrwin his unforgiving father who had bequeathed his wealth to his wifo absolutely these calamities were a sufficient reason to lady petherwin for pardoning all concerned she took by the hand the forlorn ethelbertawho seemed rather a detached bride than a widowand finished her education by placing her for two or threo years in a boardingschool at bonn latterly he had brought the girl to england to live under hvr roof as daughter and companion th1 condition attached being that ethelberta was never openly to recognise her poor relations this is the lady whose hand is the subject of contention throughout the book if mr anthony trollope had been commissioned to trace mrs petherwins adventures in search of a husband he would probably have contented himself with bringing out in a series of clever descriptions of mrs petherwin in society that her varnish of gentility was only skindeep that the heart of the butlers daughter beat beneath the elegant garb of the fine lady and he would have found in this plenty of material for an entertaining comedy of manners but mr hardy has chosen another line he drops the question of ethelbertas manners on one side with an understanding that they were as perfect as if her fathers vestibules had been lined with ancestral mail and sets himself to the more intricate task of tracing how ethelberta threw overboard various lovers and made up her mind to accept the suit of a profligate old lord there is not much difficulty it will be said in that nor indeed would there have been if mr hardy had written from the point of view of the cynic a marriage of love renounced for a marriage of convenience is a very commonplace affair but the peculiarity aud originality of mr hardys conception lies in the motives which he assigns for ethelbertas choice and his mastery of the novelists art is shown in the skill with which he traces the working of contending motives if the  hand of ethelberta had not appeared before  daniel deronda mr hardy might have been accused of borrowing his method under great variety of character and circumstances from  george eliot ethelberta is a character in which passion is ruled by judgment she was not incapable of passion but reason clearsighted calculation of consequences had the upper hand a talent for demureness under difficulties without though coldbloodedness which renders such a bearing natural and easy a face and hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by nature turbulent as a mave is a constitutional arrangement much to bo desired by people in general yet had ethelberta been framed with less of that gift in her her life might have been more comfortable as an experience and brighter as an example though perhaps duller as a story such a character is dangerous the most cruel monsters the most shameless adventurers are often made of such materials if ethelbertas judgement had been occupied solely in controlling her turbulent impulses to her own advantage her biographer might have had to record a very unlovely career but she was not a selfish woman though she did read bentham and slightly pervert his teaching the sentiment of family was stronger in her than the sentiment of self in the prologue which we have quoted it is said to have been a condition of lady petherwins patronage of her daughterinlaw that she should not recognise her poor relations now it was by no means with goodwill that ethelberta temporarily yielded to this condition the old butler her father had a large family of whom ethelberta was the eldest and her ruling motive in life to which every other was subordinated was the advancement of her brothers and sisters she had all a parents interest in them she was eager enough for distinction and social homage but she was resolved to put her whole family in a position of independence this was the source of all her difficulties aud the source we should think of many difficulties to the novelist if ethelberta had been a solitary adventuress her fortunes would have been much easier to trace the death of lady petherwin removed her necessity for living separate from her poor relations and at the same time imposed upon her the necessity of earning a living by her own exertions for lady petherwin and she quarrelled before the old ladys death and she was cut off with nothing as a basis of operations except the lease of a house for three years in a fashionable square it was no easy task for a woman to make a living and at the same time keep her position in society but ethelberta contrived not only to do so but also to keep all her family by her side the shifts by which this was managed the mental struggles ofthe heroine during the three years for which her fashionable residence was at her command and the grounds of ber final decision are invented and imagined with the most unfailing humour and a very sure insight into the mysteries of the conscience to lay bare the framework of mr hardys story in this analytical way would bo doing him an injustice if we did not say that his framework does not lie on the surface in this respect his art is very much higher than george eliots he traces motives with a skill not less sure and patient but with a much more perfect concealment of the process there is a freshness and sunny clearness about his work a definiteness of outline a bold play of fancy which recals in some indefinable way through all though difference of incidents and characters the air of the elizabethan comedy mr hardys carefulness in construction and regard for dramatic unity is worthy of ben jonson himself there is no straggling in the novel in every chapter it is the disposal of the hand of ethelberta that is in suspense the connecting thread is slight but it binds thc parts very firmly together from whatever point of view we regard the work we find deliberate artistic aims and unflinching fidelity of execution one of the most striking features is the way in which pictorial effects are interpenetrated with the action giving every chapter something like the vividness of a scene in a play we are not only told what the personages say but we seem to see the gesture with which they say it and the furniture or the landscape round them whether this is altogether commendable in a novel whether it does not tend to impede the course of the action and generally dull the impression of what is said and done by imposing too constant a strain on the pictorial faculty of the reader is a subject for consideration but at any rate it is interesting as an experiment we doubt whether ethelberta possesses though popular interest of some of mr hardys previous novels and so far that is a fault or at least a disadvantage to which the novelist must reconcile himself but it is more masterly as a work of artit reveals a progress in technical excellence which makes us look forward with curiosity to his next publication,biography

princes8 helene von racowitza8 auto i biography translated from the ger i man by cecil mar constable  co princess helene von racowrtzas autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of george merediths novels and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of the tragic comedians in the memorial edition of his works it is now rather more than thirty years since the princess published that account of her relations with lassalle upon which meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained his explanation brilliant and masterly as it was omitted a very important factor after all the strangest action of the heroine of the story was not her submission to her familywhich had it been the action of one of his own heroines meredith would conceivably have praised nor yet her marriage with the luckless yanko for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion and a somewhat too com placent champion of her own part in the affair clotilde the princess as meredith represents her would have been both too astute and too selfconscious to have committed this astounding blunder but the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked lassalle whether the countess hatzfeld would have to live with them an incident omitted by mere dith who no doubt thought it an in vention of the princesss and the first thing to recognise about clotildes original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing in a spirit of in genuousness verging upon fatuity  this she writes of her present volume ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child the autobiography then convinces us that the story of  the tragio comedians like that of another lady of high distinction for wit and beauty curiously enough merediths next is to be read as fiction  nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them though not a few are discoverable the whole course of the princess helenes life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with clotildes she was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous dashing manner and she went on her way vaguely drifting spasmodically candid playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures it accepting these in whatever form they offered themselves with open arm while still a child she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life and carried them into practice bw she submitted formally to her parents choice where suitors were concerned s0 that on meeting lassalle when she va nineteen she was the typical  jeune file allemande incapable of selfdirection and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility durng the short period of her engagement to lassalle she wanted she says  to tell him all about my past life and my crimes against saintly morality  but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand no no for heavens sake dont let us have any pompeian excavations   and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the autobiography the pages that treaty of lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume but even without them it would be worth reading so great is the variety of the writers experiences her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed she handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence with the support of course of her exuberant vitality that she adopted at need or was ready to adopt the professions of actress physician artist journalist in turnnot without success or some promise of it in all she was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination and took up flower  painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time indeed there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writers practical ability and common sense it is not less remarkable though less engaging that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth the conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to lassalles death a narrative sincere and poignant but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks is puzzlingly absurd the gigantic edifice of the german empire must always she writes have seemed like a prison  to lassalle  i therefore ask whether we pigmies all of us were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny and need gthe spirit of the worlds history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the empire it is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is a theosophist who published anonymously some years ago a little book entitled wie ich mein selbst fand her accounts of the many notable persons with whom she has come into contact from hans andersen and bulwer lytton of whom the latter would read aloud from his own works  while  in especially poetic passages his alice accompanied him with arpeggios on the harp to bjbrnstjerne bjrnson the wonderful old athlete his beautiful white curly hair standing straight up are always vivid and amusing and it is surprising that in a book in which personal jottings play a large part and much that is trivial is recorded there should be

received a fatal wound she presently married the victor who had been thrown over in favour of lassalle he lived only a few months and the princess afterwards appeared on the stage wrote for the

ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchen make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word  you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us  im not going to said 1 somewhat testily  the tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor the religiomin seltiments wvhich the authoress puts

a year of strangers joyous essays by yoi pawlowska duckworth and co 5s net here is the book that most of us intend to writesome day a book woven out of actual experiences owing nothing to other books to preconceived opinionsstereotyped conventions or the idle chatter of the clubs and coteries a book which expressesfaultily it may be but sincerelythe mind and soul of the author something individual and apart our english literature which has produced many great classics contains few such books as this and they are the more valuable for their rarity it is a selfconscious age and absence of selfconsciousness is of the very essence of yoi pawlowskas art a certain simplicity alike of expression and of feeling is everywhere apparent our author has wandered through europe and into the warm mysterious lands of the near easta solitary pilgrim but she has looked upon men and women upon small smiling cities and vast barren plains with an observant and sympathetic eye everywhere she has found something in which to delight and she has discovered for herselfwhat we all profess to believethat there is a certain quality called  humanity  whioh binds together in an indissoluble fellowship the peoples of the world this book is full of the joy pf life of the mere delight in living one feels that each moment brings with it for the author its appropriate gift to be perfect to the present momentis not that as pater taught us the secret of happiness  and yoi pawlowska is always in harmony with her surroundings whether kneeling before the dim altar of some gothic church chatting to an unknown companion in a railway train or seeing night with the tombs and dawn with the mountains  from the appian way soshe takes from lifegladly and with gratitudeall that it has to give and when she writes of  the gaiety of forest life the haunting shade of leafy valleys the laughter of running water the little cries of surprised wild things the joy of wood flowers and the glancing of sunlight on green moss through trembling branches  one is sure that these thingsseen and unnoticed each day by every one of ushave for her their message of beauty and consolation  to quote is almost an impertinence for no isolated passage can convey any idea of the delicate charm and fragrance of the whole but listen to the reflections of yoi pawlowska as she views rome in the moonlight from a roof garden i move to the parapet and sit on it trying to realise all that eome has done all that she will yet do i whisper her name softly  roma roma she is as beautiful now as when neros palace crowned two of her hills she does not age because she assimilates all that conies to her becomes part of her or it cannot exist and all that belongs to her is in some ways somehowgood  perhaps our critical faculties are dormant in great love certainly here we like what elsewhere we should find blatant and noisy she is great noble splendid what does it matter if that with which she clothes herself is sometimes glaring to our eyes p she can never be vulgar her personality is too great her simplicity too childlike she is no illusive fairy but agoddess carved in mountains free to the sky no pitiful comforter of the weak and the unfit no friend to the moral or physical degenerate but she thrusts a bar of steel into the hands of those who can fight she is a friend for the strong and the young in spirit for those who can draw strength from their dreams in every womans figure by michael angelo i see rome rome always even in the madonna of the pieta where a sorrowing mother sees hope in the death of her son this  year of strangers  will not be exhausted by the first reading it is not perhaps a book for all readers bnt there are many who having once read it will return to it continually as to the companionship of a tried and trnsty friend  a year of strangers by yoi pawlowska duckworth  co 5s yoi pawlowskas name is new to the literary world but those who read her book will not forget it these sketches are like the music of debussy the simple unaffected literary style has that intangible undefinable quality which is in the dancing of anna pavlova with the same elusiveness the same tender halfsad halfloving strains in it the same vivid colour touches written in an admirable english some of the sentences have a queerly foreign twist and this adds to rather than detracts from the charm of the book about which there is something infinitely pathetic and though there is no pathos in it once more we realise that for every real bit of art there is somewhere a broken heart each sketch has in it a momentary lifting of the veil on the deep recesses of a soul washed white by tears each is the work of a dreamer with the heart of a child who has been face to face with the evils of life and has found beauty there is in all this an atmosphere new to literature many have written of their travels but no one has written quite like this before here and there we find terse bits of realism true and little understood things about men and women written by one who has proved perhaps the biggest of all truthsthat there is very little difference in the feelings of the two sexes that men as well as women are often irresponsible and unpractical even hysterical that women as well as men can be true to each other have a sense of honour and can if needs must stand alone if the common want of all creatures is a love which understands everything we have only one critical bone to pick and this is with the proof reader who has left the printer to his own devices in the matter of punctuation,biography

the celtic twilight men and women dhoula and faeries by w b yeats lawrence  bullen it was math the magicianthe same math that formed the maiden blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today mr yeats is perhaps the one true follower of math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his in it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of oisin and cuchulain and if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his the celtic twilight will still remain to the saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and fairies will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before but to those who believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,biography

contributed an admirable introductory sssay and the english edition is limited o a thousand copies the change from roscoes penurious issue and from the culgar poverty of a cheap reprint is strikng fielding took rank among immortals ven while he lived and wrought and ime in spite of richardsons illiberal sharity and johnsons honest disregard las but strengthened his claims and improved his position the issue of the present editionan edition de luxe in every jen southeast of the termis a kind of official recognition of the admiration which has been his portion all along thanks to its publishers he has become one of the saints df the library as well as one of the worlds novelists his canonization is complete  the last honours have been bestowed and his reception into the hierarchy is an accomplished fact he need no longer be read in the blunt type and blurred pages of murphy and chalmers nor in the pale ink and yellow paper of original editions nor in the dogsears and meagre margins and dreadful double columns of popular reissues the greatness now thrust upon him is at once impressive and engaging in his new guise he appears as one of the handsomest and noblest classics in the language with so much to praiseand justly praise it seems ungraceful to condemn the edition has been projected on so opulent a scale and is in certain ways so complete and honourable a success that to find fault with it at all is to run the risk of appearing hypercritical and even unjust on reflection however it is impossible to reject the conclusion that the enterprise is remarkable rather for liberality and enthusiasm than for taste and judgment to begin with the size of the volumes raises objections and objections that are neither to be gainsaid nor despised fielding is before all things else a writer to be studied he wrote for the world at large and he wrote to the end that he might be read and read continually his matter his manner the terms of his philosophy the quality of his ideals the nature of his achievement proclaim him popular like scott like cervantes like shakspeare he claims not merely our acquaintance but an intimate and abiding familiarity he has no special public and to be only on nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his attraction and unworthy of his society he worked not for the boys and girls of an age but for men and women of all time  and both as an artist and as a thinker he commands unending attention and lifelong friendship he is a great inventor an unrivalled craftsman a perfect master of his material his work is the record of a lifetime of varied experience of keen observation of unwearying intellectual endeavour the types he created are vigorous and sound with an intellectual flavour peculiarly their own his novels teem with ripe wisdom and generous conclusions and improving examples he has as mr stephen remarks the undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary society with a force and accuracy not oven rivalled by any other writer not to have studied him is to be without a knowledge of the most important documents of contemporary history it is evident that such a writer is not one to be skimmed and laid aside and that it is doing his admirers doubtful service to present him in any but the handiest of forms now this is exactly what has come to pass in the present edition it is sumptuous but it is unwieldy it is inaccessible without a readingdesk and a library chair to peruse it is to engage in the performance of a literary solemnity we consider it with a respectful admiration and we think with a mixture of envy and regret of the editions of alphonso lemerre and the delightful bouquim produced by jouaust at the librairie des bibliophiles what was wanted was a fielding that could be comfortably held and easily perused and that while an ornament to the shelf would not on occasion have proved impossible to the pocketa fielding with whom the reader might converse at odd hours of the day or night with the affectionate freedom that is his due what has been achieved is a fielding to be superbly bound and gilded honoured with a prominent place in the library and venerated for his appearance a fielding to be revered at a respectful distance like a colossal pharaoh or mr addisons celebrated tragedy of  cato another point on which we regret to find ourselves at variance with the publishers of the new fielding is the illustrations it is at all times difficult to understand why the library edition of a great writer should be held incomplete without pictures and the difficulty is increased tenfold when the great writer enjoys such a position as is henry fieldings in the first place it is not doubtful that if fielding wrote for any class of readers in particular it was for readers who were interested in his work not as a vehicle for illustrations but primarily and essentially as literature and that could we suppose him to have been consulted in the matter he would be mortified to find that after over a hundred years of popularity his novels are held to stand in need of adventitious assistance again tom jones and  jonathan wild and amelia have been classics for many years we know them intimately and we have formed as definite a conception of the appearance of their heroes and heroines as we have of the men and women of shakespeare and cervantes themselves and it is certain that the artist who essays to improve upon our imaginings for us or to thrust them out to make room for imaginings of his own is doomed in advance to failure moreover and this is perhaps the strongest argument of allthere is a gap between the present and that part of the past which it was fieldings lot to represent for us between the convention of today and the convention of a century and a half ago between the age of gladstone and the age of walpole that is for all practical purposes as impassable as styx itself the present is an epoch of sentiment its ideals and ambitions are mainly emotional what it chiefly loves is romance or the affectation of romance passion selfconscious solemnity and a ertain striving after the picturesque in fieldings time there was doubtless a food deal of sentimentality for his geneation delighted not only in western md trunnion and mrs slipslop but in pamela and clarissa and the pathetic lie fevre but for all that it wasat all wents in so far as it was interesting to fielding and in so far as fielding has pictured ita generation that knew nothing f romance and was keenly interested in lommon sense and took a vast deal of honest pleasure in wit and humour and a rather ruculent type of satire it is evident that such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between a past of this sort and such a present as our own must f necessity bo few and small their importance too is greatly diminished when we reflect on the nature and tendency 3f certain among though essential elements of fieldings art and mind the most vigorous and the most individual of these is perhaps his irony the next is that abundant vein of pure intellectual comedy by the presence of which his work is exalted to a place not much inferior to that of such work as the  tartuffe  and the  ecole des femmes these rare and splendid qualities are distinguishing features in the best and soundest part of fieldings work of irony he is probably the greatest english master of pure comedy the intellectual manipulation and transmutation of what is spiritually ridiculous in manners and societyhe is both in narrative and in dialogue the greatest between shakespeare and mr george meredith and with both our sympathy is to say the least of it imperfect in no small degree ave have learned to be sentimental and selfsufficient with rousseau to be romantic and chivalrous with scott to be emotional with dickens to take ourselves seriously with balzac and george eliot there are touches of feeling in our laughter even though the feeling be but spite we have acquired a habit of politenessa tradition of universal consideration and respect and our theory of satire is rounded by the harmless generalities of mr du maurier on the one hand and the malevolent respectability of mr w s gilbert on the other a consequence of all this is that in attempting the illustration of  tom jones and  jonathan wild the modern artist enters on a task for which he is indifferently prepared and in which he can at best achieve but an imperfect success this is what has happened to mr small he is probably as good a draughtsman for wood as the publishers could have selected in picturing the aspects and emotions of his contemporaries he is usually successful he has the true sentiment of black and white his invention is varied his design expressive and sound yet of the forty pictures he has contributed to the new fielding there is hardly one that does not seem inappropriate to his matter and that does not act as a barrier between his author and his authors readers it is not that the illustrations are bad in themselves on the contrary many of them are excellent but they have little or none of fieldings spirit and they are in no sense in harmony with fieldings work in thackeray or in messrs besant and rice in  denis duval or  the chaplain of the fleet they would be well enough in  amelia and  joseph andrews  they appear misplaced and their affect is discomforting they have faults f their own as for instance a certain inlecision in invention which has resulted in the production of two or three westerns half a dozen joneses several jonathan wilds and a strange variety of amelias ind sophias but their chief fault is that they do not illustrate fielding mr small has left his comedy to shift for itself and has endowed him with picturesque and romantic qualities altogether foreign to his art and to the epoch in which it was produced he ignores lady bellaston and miss matthews and mrs ellison  he only shows us col bath as a defeated duellist and sergeant atkinson in though act of saving his masters life to him capt blifil is but a body to be carried upstairs and jones a slim young gentleman to be presented under the influence of violent emotion  he has made nothing of partridge nothing of the ordinary and next to nothing of mr abraham adams and for one picture of lady booby conceived in something of the right spirit he has given us half a dozen of sophia which are merely pretty and clever and accomplished and just as he has suppressed the element of comedy so has he exaggerated the element of incident his picture of joseph andrews stripped and abandoned has the gloom and the terror of a design for  eugeno aram he has drawn us three or four duels as many bouts at fisticuffs and a couple of highway robberies his sketch of jonathan wild picking the counts pocket might illustrate a melodrama in a strand theatre his presentment of booth in prison is like a page from a modern novel in the manner of  oliver twist his designs in one word are suggestive now of a fielding who wrote for the adelphi and now of a fielding who lived at bedford park the impression as may be imagined is peculiar to this may be added that though fairly well engraved they are on the whole ill printed for the reproduction of such trenchant contrasts as those in which mr small indulges such a medium as india paper seems improper it is soft and spongy and it absorbs and spreads the ink so that an impression is often produced of vagueness and indecision it is probable that a better effect might be obtained with ordinary platepaper which is hard and glossy and permits of a great deal of clearness of outline and transparency of darks and shadows for the selection of wood engraving in preference to etching as a means of illustration the projectors of the edition deserve a great deal of praise and we cannot but regret that their venture should be unfortunateas in certain ways it undoubtedly is in addition to all this it must be admitted that the editing of the new fielding is by no means so scholarly as was to be desired the arrangement is entirely arbitrary  the text save that in  amelia a few suppressed passages have been reprinted appears to be mainly that of arthur murphy of annotations and explanations which are absolutely indispensable to a correct and complete understanding of fielding and which judiciously supplied would have gone far to make the edition final there is not one in all the ten volumes that these are defects and grave ones will readily be granted they are blemishes too that were hardly to be looked for in such an elaborate publication as the present to the absence of critical and historical annotations we have just referred  and we shall add no more than that in our opinion it does away with any pretensions to finality the edition might have been supposed to possess scarce less noticeable are the vices of arrangement tom jones 1749 the authors second novel is printed first it is followed immediately by amelia 1751 which was his last and this in its turn is succeeded by joseph andrews 1742 which was his first in though same volume with joseph andrews appears though  journey from this world to the next which first appeared in the second volume of the  miscellanies published in 1743 while the fifth volume is composed of  jonathan wild originally printed as the third volume of the  miscellanies and of fieldings contributions to the champion which appeared in 17391740 two or three years before the sixth volumo contains in the order specified thirtyseven articles from the covent garden journal 1752 against the twentysix reprinted by murphy  the ten numbers of the true patriot 1745 included in murphys edition  the two numbers of the jacobites journal 1748 republished by murphy the philosophical transactions 1743 the essay of the remedy of afflictions the  dialogue between alexander the great and diogenes the cynic the interlude and the essays on  conversation character and nothing 1743 and the  clear state of the case of elizabeth canning and the  case of bosavern penlez which appeared full ten years later the seventh volume opens with the  voyage to lisbon which is a posthumous publication  passes on to the  charge to the middlesex grand jury  and the  inquiry into the causes of the late increase of robbery which date from 1751 and 1753 respectively and after presenting us with the early prefaces to  david simple and the  familiar letters continues with the  translation of the second olynthiac and the  poems included in the  miscellanies in 1743 and concludes with the translation of juvenals sixth satire which is one of fieldings first performances the last three volumes are devoted to the plays and include  very properly  the two pieces first printed among the  miscellanies it is to be noted that the dates of production are not always given and that the editor has very wisely prefaced each play with a statement of the cast where much is wanting one is apt in the nature of things to feel grateful for little of mr stephens introductory essay we can speak in terms of almost unqualified approval it is not so hearty and cheerful as the excellent note on fielding contributed to one of the series of hours in a library it repeats unquestioningly the old old story of the fielding portrait it comments upon lady marys estimate of fielding and horace walpoles malevolent historiette as though the ladys literary weaknesses and walpoles fondness for decorating his gossip had no existence and were not to be taken into the writers calculation and it errs a little in electing to consider its hero according o the canons of modern morality in showing i trifle more interest in the religious inluences that made him what he was than erhaps they deserve and in declining to give i detailed opinion about fieldings relations vith his contemporaries and particularly vith his innumerable posterity but when all is said it remains a piece of singularly good and able work and one of svhich even its author may well be proud lt bears in every sentence the stamp of acute

the secret of an empress by countess zanardi landi cassell  co 16s net the last of the children of the emperor and empress of austria who figure in the  almanach de gotha  was born in 1868  but the writer of the book before us claims to be the daughter of the empress elizabeth and states that she was born in 1882 she informs the public that her birth took place at a chateau in normandy where her mother was staying under an assumed name but she does not know her birthday a few weeks later she was smuggled into the house of some people in vienna and it was announced to the viennese that the lady of this house had given birth to a daughter the author of this curious memoir it is stated in the first chapter that the emperor  came secretly to see the empress while she was at the chateau of sassetot in the seine inferieure but that  what passed between her and the emperor now will never be revealed it is suggested that the reason why the empress wished her child brought up without knowledge of her parentage was that the empress did not want this last of her children to be educated at the court and preferred her childhood to be as different as possible from that of her other children the book is full of mysterious references to ludwig ii of bavaria and to the affection of the empress for his memory which cannot fail to make the reader ask what it is that the author means she is however studiously vague and declines to take the public into her confidence on the most important of all points though she indulges in hundreds of pages of trivial details about her childhood on one occasion after the empress had told her that she was her real mother she ventured to ask  why were you so fond of ludwig of bavaria mother   she notes that the empress  started violently at my words and i felt that i should have liked to bite off my foolish tongue but the empress recovered her selfpossession and remarked that the question had been unexpected that  she would like to talk to me about him she knew i must be bewildered and it was time that i should be enlightened a little the enlightenment was  little as all that it comes to as reported by the author is that in the opinion of the empress ludwig ii was not mad but the empress brought the conversation to a close with the significant words   we two remain to mourn for him in the account given of the death of this bavarian king wide variations will be noticed from all the official statements the authors account derived she says from the empress elizabeth is a convenient one  but to the public it may be incredible that the empress was an odd woman that she spent a large part of her life in wandering about the world and in living quietly where she was unrecognized is already known to the public  but there is much in this volume which will interest those who care for gossip and will tell them for the first time why the empress hid herself and how she contrived to spend long holidays often in the same hotel with the child whom the austrian court refuses to recognise as being a member of the royal family the author lays stress on her account of the mayerling tragedy and what she calls the true solution of that mystery is that the crown prince rudolph was murdered and did not commit suicide she believes that a party hostile to him was formed at the court the crown prince took no interest in military affairs and he found the soldiers and the emperor were against him his unhappy marriage is described at length and the way in which he became acquainted with marie vetsera when she was staying with him at mayerling the emperor is said to have sent baron bolfrass to search the house and arrest the crown prince rudolph threatened to shoot the first man who entered the room in a struggle the crown prince shot a gamekeeper and was himself shot as was marie vetsera this is the story ofthe countess zanardi landi and it is given as coming direct from the empress elizabeth the author reports that shortly before the death of the empress her mother promised to introduce her to the world   should i know my father and ssers   i asked  yes of course she answered 41 wonder how i shall get on with them    very well i hope dear anyhow they will not trouble us much  the author asked the empress how she was going to  bring her out and the answer was   very simply th emperor will have to announce officially   tht th empress and he have a third daughtr living who has been educated away from th court and who will be introduced on the occasion of his jubilee it will not make any trouble whatever all is in order the papers and everything that is al that will be neeessarv after the assassination of the empress the author wished to get into touch with her relatives but the lady with whom she was boarding warned her in the folowing words to avoid trouble   your mother and the emperor never northeast reed is it any wonder then that they went separate ways and as far a possible sought consolation elsewhere     von must keep quiet for your mother sake if you dont want the story in everybodys mouth according to the tale here told the empress left her child a fortune of 160000 she married a man for whom she did not care the money was placed in his hands and he at once lost it by seculation in 1906 she went with him to canada but parted from him in 1908 and after a series of struggles was married again to count zanardi landi the countess describes the legal action which she began in vienna and says that she refused 1 million crowns to settle it she gives the reasons why her lawyers dropped itreasons which are not very convincing and says that when they had thrown her over she was advised that her only course was to publish this work  books biographical the secret of an empress by countess zanardi landi cassell i6s net we took up this volume not without misgiving but that flavour of courtly rottenness which generally hangs about this class of literature is not at all pronounced here on the contrary the book is a protest against everything of the kindthe author is animated with all the empress elizabeths hatred of restraint and conventionality its title to be sure is a popular one and may well have been chosen with a view to appealing to snobs of every class with a view to  selling it deserves to sell we hope it will bring all the material profit possible to those concerned for countess landi is unquestionably entitled to every kind of compensation she can extract out of this world she tells her tale with such straightforward simplicity that these pages we think will not fail to procure her a number of new friends vivid sidelights are thrown upon the manifold tragedies and absurdities of the house of hapsburg and the fantastic ritual there is no other word for it which orders the life of the austrian court that perverse institution overhung by the mephitic vapours of jesuitry where the empress may not even see her own children unless her visit is announced twentyfour hours beforehand where everybody up to the very head of the state moves about like puppets in some sinister pantomime there is a good little bit too about the empresss ideas of what constitutes a small villa mother had intended to have a small villa at corfu with beautiful gardens attacked to it the cost was not meant to exceed a million pounds in english money the merest labourers cottage  we would like very much to know the name of the italian publisher who was officially hindered from printing this interesting document and also that of the french firm which

george eliot although probably george eliot is no longer a household word to us the literary preeminence of her work amply justifies the  conscientious anl prolonged labourr which mliss leakin has devoted to the detail of her early life we are not indeed prepared to accept without qualification the theory said to have been established by m ernmile legouis that the  adolescence of genius  is not only great enough to engage the investigators concen trated powers but  from the standpoint of literary origins more important than anv other phase of a career but no one can 1uestion the interest which must always be felt about the parentage childhood and education of a favourite author especially one who seenis to identify herself so thoroughly as eorge elliot with the dreams and sufferings of her characters 11er personality in fact will carry with it an explanation of that strange mingling of intellectual arrogance and aloofness with lassionate sympathy which characterises her art miss d ea kin in one of her few critical comments has quoted the  wise and tender words  of mr gilfil ol sees us as we are altogether not in starate telitig or actions as our fellowmen do    our thoughts

net herbert  daniel by teini5ssi  nof fredhk hollar for he had grat poaeeaaioas by g f watts worse than we are just as they are often better than we are we are always doing each other injustice and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve because we oniv hear andi see separate actions we dont see each others whole nature then she says  this was one of the things george eliot longed to sav that way that god has of seeing us is the wav the true artist has it is the way george eliot herself had this emphatic and picturesque statement however does not cover the whole matter and somewhat depreciates the value of the personal insight which miss dleakin has specially set herself to afford for much of george eliots power comes from that halfknowledge which we derive from our own experience as we all know she put much of herself into maggie tulliver she had faced in her own person many of the problems confronting romola and esther lvon wendolen dorothea and will ladislaw we mav learn from this  early life how faithfully her novels reflect her deepest convictions on men and life it proves also that like her own heroines she seldom depended on her own judgment however tenaciouslv if not dogmatically she would pronounce upon the convictions she had acquired at every stage of her intellectual or emotional development she confesses to an  absolute need of some one person who should be all in all to her and to whom she should he all in all probably without george  henry lewes she would never have written a novel each of the many religious phases through which miss deakin has traced her was dlue directly to the personal influences as mliss nmeynell expresses it in each case the apostolic man becomes the womans conscience such chances it will be remembered were at an end before the publication of her first novelin her thirtyninth year she had then settled town into a broad humanitarianism subscribing to no definite creed but convinced  of the efficacy thit lies in all sincere faith and the spiritual blight that comes with no faith miss mlevnell i n d e e d defines her ethical code as  uncom promisingly christian  and  very hard admitting no possibility of  compromise or dispensation the code of a woman who in her own conulict of life has broken all the pledges made and implied for her by her parentage kin and educlation on the personal aspect of this question miss deakin reveals more sy impathetic generositt greater subtlety andi in our opinion more justice she enleavours to show that eorge eliot never put greater value on the restrictioins of conventionality than when she broke them in her opinion only exceptional circunimtances like her own coiuld maake reeltlion permissible she never resented  the qluick condemination  of public opinion however much the mistinderstanding of friends hurt her privately she held herself justified and never regarded the teaching of her novels as an atonement they upheld what she had always believed  what in her own heart she felt she had practised miss deakin has justified her contention by reliable evidence perhaps the most valuable part of her work she also tells us how early in life george eliot was puzzled by finding that glory was an attendant on luck instead of on goodness 9 and that like maggie tulliver  at a very early age she got the idea into her head that she would become a person of importance in the world we find her accepting a  compromise  with her father on the trying question of religious observances and are assured that however autobiographical or reminiscent her books contained no actual portraits from real life there is too an interesting passage about the  tidiness  of her writing which recalls mrs poysers dairy a quality evincing selfdiscipline and conscientiousness not entirely congenial to the highest art yet surely it is as an artist that george eliot will live by her characterization her insight and her wit her genius for dialogue invention and narrative she has given us a glorious gallery of fulllength portraits increasing the number of our intimate friends and through them the problems of life which have an endless fascination for all who care to think in that sense her work remains as dr herford puts it  a great and still unexhausted literary and ethical force miss deakin could not give us too much detail in illustration of her personality and her powers though only the serious student will wish to follow so closely her various incursions into philosophy it is not as a thinker that we value george eliot today the quotations and deductions from her letters and journals are most welcome we could willingly have been spared some of her essays and reviews r brimley johnson,biography

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimgoliar several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of mt vernon ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the republican wit for the unchivalrous irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour here are some of them john mitchel says in his southern ciiizenthsx this country  needs a rattling war she certainly does not need any more rattling irishmen john mitchel the irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the hon john bell in the us senate he is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with macbeth stop that dreadful bell we thought the quotation was from othello but they have probably a new shakespeare in louisville the sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words again  john mitchel who made his escape from botany bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  john mitchel is by this time in europe we are rid of him if he could have had his way we should ijave been rid by him the ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   the more our ladies practice walking the more graceful they become in their movements those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one a graceful correctionthe proper study of mankind is womanpunch woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive a kentucky editor

young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of utah are her women it is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources the last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption with these specimens of the prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it we will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers  the poet of the breakfast table saturday november 2 1872 literature by oliver wendell holmes routledge  sons we have had the autocrat and the professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour we cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded it would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the poet like the autocrat and professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly the breakfasttable series is now complete its fault is its extreme length the poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse if he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as pas trop de zele the poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue there are fourteen persons at the breakfast table the opposite ends are occupied by the landlady and the capitalist on one side are the poet the scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a man of letters a master of arts a young girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called scheherazade and the lady on the other side are dr b franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the astronomer the member of the haouse as the legislator calls himself the registrarof deeds the salesman and that boy the lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community he turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary in this company the poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures they are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries the poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match the following are among very numerous examples  it aint just the thing to grease your ex with the isle of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do again   it is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle cotton mather was miserable all his days i am afraid after that entry in his diary  this day dr sewele was chosen president for his piety1 we may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal americans believe that there are no hs in england and frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  however we could match the goodlooking landlady of the poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope the daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the order of things and who remarks  i hope to do some sound thinking in heavenif i ever get there  fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects the first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted they have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from heaven the groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem we approve of the old masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed i dont like your chopped music any way that woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesflorence nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowiez out isnt not that exactly but something like it i have been to hear some music pounding after describing the concert with much humour he adds i like to hear a woman sing and i like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me i know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and pop went a small piece of artillery    that boy was in his seat looking demure enough the master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which i saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our great organthat himalayan home of harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often there is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  i thank god that a great many people believe a great deal more than i do i think when it comes to serious matters i like those who believe more than i do better than those who believe less there is no doubt that this is a general feeling we endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   it is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it if he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone in quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the breakfast table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids the character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the young girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the weekly bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it the poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul she ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail i spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night the poet thinks the toiling scheherazade of the weekly bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers the sunworshippers daughter which she wrote for the bucket here is a sample  kiss mine eyelids beauteous morn blushing into life newborn  lend me violets for my hair and thy russet robe to wear and thy ring of rosiest hue set in drops of diamond dew  kiss my lips thou lord of light kips my lips a soft good night westward sinks thy golden car  leave me but the evening star and my solace that shall be borrowing all its light from thee  we may now rise from the breakfast table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that wellfurnished board,biography
n boyne water a talc by te o1ha famity a  3 vols 12moanotber tale of the waely school mth  ft werly school with jreland for the 5cc and irelands history for the subject sated as we have been with scottish story we are quite ready to turn to the records of another country and ireland as well as or better than any other she furnishes materials in abundance she has been oppressed for ages and her oppressors have been her historians she is catholic and we have her story told by protestants misrepresentations inevitably followed and prejudices have now rooted in the hearts of successive generations it is high time to hear the other side freely and fully and no way half so effective as the medium of tales for nothing else nowadays gets regarded the writer of the tale before us is well qualified to play the part of national historian under the guise of the national novelist isle knows the country and its history and is deeply stung with a sense of that country injuries he wants nothing but a little more resolution to cut away superfluities and a little more address in conduicting us at once medias in res he is too fond of surprises he attempts by crowding incidents to give that life and reality which would be better accomplished by lopping off the encumbrances of minor ones and the flow of his language is too frequently checked by breaks and parentheses but these are curable defects he has the stuff and staple of a good narrator in him when he comes to the action and warms in the business of his tale he is vivid and vigorous scenes of bustle and confusion rouse his best energies and his powers of description mental moral and natural are of no ordinary cast historical novelists at least those of any value have an object distinct from the tale that of the author of the scotch novels is sufficiently obvious and the views of the writer of the boyne water are equally conspicuous he regards the struggle of the revolution as one of religious parties he gives james credit for moderation and believes he had no other view in any of his attempts than to rescue catholics from their oppressions and to establish general toleration of course the revolution itself was gratuitous on the other hand he considers william to have been influenced by the same views but overborne by the fears and bigotries of the protestant clergy of the latter there can be little question but quite as little we think that james whatever were his private wishes never would have been sutf fered to stop at all short of the reestablishment of catholic superiority the main object of the novel is to give a representation of the state of ireland from jamess abdication as his expulsion is still curiously phrased to the treaty of limerick though the tale commences with his accession just to give the author an opportunity of exhibiting the feelings of expectation which that event excited among all partie to the principat characters of i the tale we are introduced on their way from belfast to cushindoll a village on the northeast coast the travellers consist of evelyn and his sister both very young ver handsome and very amiable in the style of those who are destined to figure in  modern story with their guardians and attendants of whom in our brief sketch we shall have no occasion to speak in crossing the hills the topography of which is very elaborately described extraordinary difficulties are encounteredroads were not macadamized in those daysand to fill up the measure of their alarms and embarrassments a tremendous storma tornado such an one as is now never seen without the tropics overtakes them a sweeping dispersion ensues one falls to the earth another performs a series of somersets down the hills and miss evelyn is luckily rescued from destructionher frightened jennet backing to the very edge of a precipice7by the critical appearance and fearless energies of a young gentleman and lady these young natives of the hills a brother and sister prove to be persons of most surprising excellence vigorous and resolute as the mountaineers of romance are of course entitled to be to the house of their parent a ruined chieftain of the clan mcdonnel the young evelyn and the party are finally carried for shelter intimacy soon grows up among the young people and they are speedily betrothed to each other out of these sudden engagements spring the subsequent interests and perplexities of the talethe mcdonnels being catho lies and the evelyns protestants evelyn just to give him time to reach his majority is dispatched to the westindies for a couple of years and returns to ireland to consummate his marriage with eva mcdonnel at the period when every body was in a state of excitement respecting the invasion of william mcdonnel meets his friend on landing at carrickfergus aid in a few hours each of them unknown to the other is enlisted on opposite sides evelyn is encountered by george walker the well known defender of derry and by the urgency of that wily agitator is engaged to take part in the approaching struggle and at the same moment the jesuit ohaggerty presents mcdonnel with a commission of dragoons in the service of james walker labours hard to break off the match with the catholic eva and at last exacts a promise to be summoned to the nuptials on the day of the double marriage the ceremony delayed by the nonarival of walker at length proceeds and eva and evelyn are coupled by the catholic priest but just as the second ceremony is commencing strange noises are heard and a furious gust of wind extinguishes most of the lights and in rushes walker declaring the marriage illegal and announcing the landing in england of william the deliverer confusion follows the ceremony suspends walker calls upon evelyn and ohaggerty upon mcdonnel to fulfil their respective engagements and sacrifice their private wishes to public duties each is surprised by the discovery of the others engagement sitspicion spring up in the breast of each their passions kindle high words follow and brides and bridegrooms separate impelled by walker evelyn joins the ulster union and accepts a commission in williams name but before joining the troops he conducts his distressed sister to her friends at derry and proceeds himself to look after his family estate on the lough neagh on advancing up the avenue he perceives unusual stirrings in the house and while hastening forward to ascertain the cause lie strikes against the legs of his own servant dangling from a tree alarmed and retiring his retreat is instantly cut off on all sides by armed men who force him to go forward to the house which he now discovers to be in the full possession of a party of rapparees he receives a very hearty welcome from them to his own home and is hospitably entertained by them with a supper provided from his own stores and by his own cook the feast is suddenly interrupted by the intelligence of an enemy at hand up starts the party measures are instantly taken for defense and the commander places a guard over evelyn with orders to shoot him on the spot should the invaders prevail these invaders prove to be evelyns friends headed by walker the rapparees were defeated and evelyn was rescued from his fate by the artifice of a young lass who had taken a fancy to him and threw some water on the lock of the guards pistol which was thus snapped at him in vain evelyn now joined the forces under lord mount alexander and was wounded in the first battle fought at dromore on the retreat from newry and left bleeding on the field on recovering his senses he seizes a stray horse and sets out for the north beyond carrickfergus the redshanks lord antrims dragoons a troop of which mcdonnel commanded were scouring the country and lhe quickly found himself pursued his horse failing he betook himself to his legs and after flying across we know not how many hills and dales and endeavouring to descend a steep declivity he sunk at last exhausted in a hole of the rock till his pursuers came up with him at the first of whom he dis charged a pistol it was mcdonnel himself no harm was done they recognise each other and a reconciliation follows he refuses to take evelyn prisoner in spite of the sulky remonstrances of his men but dismissing them to the next town himsclf to the neglect apparently of his military duties engages to eonthllet h    i  l4l1jz friend to a place of safety this hoevesr is not so easily aecomllised prodigious diffieultwis are encountered a most painful and laborious succession of elimubgi id slippings and escapes by the wq t is a vast deal too much of diffia if this kind the realities are intoe enough but the descriptions are s momt so byandbye however eva m them and evelyn and his bride explyn all are now proceeding very hkarmoniou together when suddenly a party of ulsgi dragoons come upon them and mcdow is instantly taken prisoner but placed aid the charge of his friend eva now gees to her friends and evelyn with mcdound on parole proceeds to derry to visit his sin ter and mcdonnel and miss evelyn swh of course come again to a perfect under standing the memorable siege had already orn menced and evelyn takes an active pm in the defence under walker whose cleo racter is here ably developed a singular union of energy craft and fanaticism the whole progress of the siege to the final relief by the arrival of kirke is faith fiully and vigorously detailed and presents many a striking picture of the miseries sus tained by that devoted city fromn the can nonadingy without and the famine within with the unresisting submission of the citi zens and walker and his few energetic apprenticeboys in the course of the siege an attempt is again made to celebrate the marriage between mcdonnel and evelyns sister which is again interrupted by the mysterious agency of a wild irishwomn possessed of something like the attributes of omniscience and ubiquity and the poor girl at last dies from the combined effects of fright famine and fever on the raising of the siege the mcdlon nels and evelyn being again all together and passes and protections obtained they proceed towards old mcdonnels butby this time schomberg had landed 2o000 men and kirke had set out to join him to wards the south old mcdonnels unluckily lay in his way and there was danger let he should be beforehand with them they speeded therefore with all their migh1 and in the deepest anxietyall too late kirke and his troops had just quitted the smoking ruins and the followers of the dea were hanging on the trees by dozens tie shrieks of poor eva over the deadbody of her father bring kirke and his fellow sljk again evelyn presents the protections fov his companions in vain at the moment of imminent peril a party of rapparees cowe suddenly upon them a skirmish ensue evelyn is cut down and on waking to life agrain finds his head resting on the lap of i young woman whrom he recognises to be the same who had before saved his life ad who now informs him that mcdonnel bid perished and eva was carried off by kirkc the recollection of kirkes wellknt1o character threw him into a storm of bh ror and he makes desperate efforts to pmr slue him in spite of his weakness and the i rls efforts to detain shim they had not roceeded far before they were challenged by the troops of his own volunteercorps from the commander of whom evelyn forthwith solicits a horse and attendants to enable him to overtake kirke when to his confusion and despair he learns that kirke had left orders to put him under arrest resistance is vain but three or four days bringt up the corps to schombergs camp schomberg with kirke by his side was reviewing the troops evelyn advances in front of the line and in the presence of schomberg demands of kirke the cause of his arrest who charges him with aiding and abetting rcbels he appeals to the old duke and exhibits his passes and protections and is immediately released then finding schomberg disposed to befriend him he demands of kirke an account of eva kirke haughtily refuses evelyn challenges and schlomberg sanctions the challenge and witnesses the conflict on the spot by an accidental slip evelyn is finally worsted and having put his cause upon his failing sword is thus left without redress eva appears lost to him for ever schomberg appoints him his aiddecamp retains him about him for the remainder of the campaign and at the end of it sends him with despatcles to england in london or rather at kensington where wiliam resided he is detained for the winter the interior of the court is thrown open and we have william and mary and ben tinck and burnett very characteristically exhibited two or three times in the gar dens he gets a glimpse of a person in a male dress whom he believes to be eva but in spite of his efforts he is unable to speak with her in the spring he returns to schomberg and at last gets a short leave of absence to attend to his private affairs his first step is to go straight to sarsfields camp then at dublin sarsfield had saved the life of evelyn and his friend before derry wlhen they had indiscreetly accompanied the deputation of the city to jamess camp and on this ground of acquaintanceship evelyn ventures to introduce hiwrself to that brave man to procure intelligence of eva he gets detained by the outposts and meets again with the girl who had twice saved his life and also with the figure whom he had taken for eva but again is baffled in his attempts to speak with her sarsfield receives him with kindness and testifies an interest in his distress though knowing nothing whatever of the fate of mcdonnel or eva he recollects there is a lady of the name at jamess court and he engages to take him in the evening to the castle there he is noticed as a stranger by james who enters into conversation with him defending his conduct and vindicating his rights blat what is most interesting to evelyn he recognises among the attendants of lady lyreonnel the lady lieutenant bis own eva but again every attempt to addres her is defeated hisinterview with james is thus suddenly interrupted by the junex pected announcement of willias landim and having actually been six days in the country the party breaks up sersfield dismisses evelyn with a pass and hi makes his speedy way to rejoin schomberg now comes on williams brief campaign and we fight the battle of the boyne bravely over again evelyn who in the engagement had acted as aiddecamp to wit liam is takeni prisoner and after jamess desertion of his cause and country accompanies sarsfield to limerick where he has the luck again to undergo the harassings and miseries of a siege here too he aocompanies sarsfield on the memorable ex pedition in which with the aid of the rap parees he succeeded in destroying williams ammunition and baggage the commander of these rapparees turns out to be his long lost friend mc donnel whose kindness to him had brought suspicion upon himself and finally dismissal from the service resentment and despair drove him to head a band of these desperadoes he ipeets with evelyn and while pouring curses upon him and preparing to cut him down a signal from his friends arrests his pu pose here too again evelyn meets with the person whom he had so often taken for eva and discovers him at last to be a younger brother of hers some words of explanation pass but he is as violent as his elder brother all is mystery to evelyn he cannot guess the cause of this intemperance all however is now hastening to a conclusion and eclaircisse ment iumerick is reduced to extremity and on the very day of its surrender came evy herself her younger brother the wild om niscient and ubiquious onagh and the girl who had so often shown her devotion to evelyn explanations follow the girl confesses that love for evelyn had seduced her to play false to report falsely of eva to evelyn and of evelyn to eva at this moment comes the intelligencethat the rapparee commander had fillen into the hands of williams general and was just going to be shot his friends appeal to sarsfield who generously flies to his succour solicits his pardon and with difficulty obtains it upon condition of his going into exile evelyn and eva remain behind blessed and prosperous and in due time we read inform their banished friends of a family of three little cherubs prattling about them though the story creeps very tiresomely at the commencement when once the real business of the action begins the narrative never flags to the end it is full of bustle and variety the historical cbsracters are all faithfully poutrayea sa we have all the distinguished persols of the day from james a wlliam ad y to burnett and walker several persons are introduced whom we have found no occasion to mention some of more some of less importance particularly a blind man whose agency is of

young lives by richard le gallienne arrowsmith fis 7ms is mr le galliennes third novel and taken with these that preceded itthe quest of the golden girl and the romance of zion chapelit shows us clearly what ara his powers and limitations in fiction it shows us that tos the qelineation of a certain type of young man a product of the best two decades mr le gallienne has considerable gifts he young man is of the nonconformist middle dasses his home ls strict arid pious his own bent however is for poetry and gladness he is frank impulsive enthusiastic generous warmhearted intolerant of alltiiat is dull and mechanical and very tolerant of whatever is  done beautifully however it may conflict with the moral code he is an agnostic with leanings towards elaborate ritual a busy but superficial reader his gods being keats and pater a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of rossetti ana burnejones a sentimentalist he oan adore many young women at once and in rhyming  love  and  dova  and  bosom  and  blossom  he is expert if he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable but far less  lovable  and to be  lovable is his end in life that is the type of young man to whioh we refer a type whioh at this moment is common in london and in all the great towns all over the oountry and it is this young man whom mr le gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill and as we said last week in noticing another new novel every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction mr le gallienne is not a good novelist he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful he ia always the essayist astorytolling glad of an opportunity to digress but though he has little to toll in the book before us and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed the tone is bright and sunny and the characters are pretty and gay but the readers will have to be simple we fear because with the exception of the type who rings true there is a great deal of chocolatebox unreality about the story baptist ministers for example onwhose shelves is all the most exquisite literature of doubt are not really named chrysostom trotter it is largely these wilful little perversions of fact which mr le gallienne always indulges in that keep sophisticated readers from his works but for their especial benefit we take it the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher mr le gallienne here hits round him with spirit sparing not even himself we quote a passage presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hairlike a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood at the same moment there entered as if by design his very eatithesis a short firmlybuilt clerkly fellow with a head hkea billiardball in need of a shave a big brown  moustitohs aad enormous spectacles   that said the publisher referring to the mooninthepiriewood young man is our young apostle of sentiment our new maa of feeling the besthated maa we have and the other is our young apostle of blood he is all for musole aad brutalityaaa he makai all the mouser it is oae of our many fashions just now to sing  britain aad brutality but my impression is that our yoong maa of feeling wul have his daythough he will have to wait for it he would hasten it if he would cut his hair but tbat he says he will never do his hair is his battlecry aad hair too he says is a gift well he enjoys himself and loves a fight though you mightnt think it to look at him in laying young lives aside we cannot honestly say it has interested us but it is innocent and bright and young and it is written with care  young lives bv richard le gallienne bristol arrowsmith a duet with an occasional chorus by a conan doyle grant richards here is another volume of secondrate sentiment from mr richard le gallienne we cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or notat any rate it reads as if it were meant to be it describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a northern town whose home surroundings as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes were uncongenial the young manto the benefit probably of the home to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his fatherdetermined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature he gets some poems published he falls in love and he keeps up his affection for his sister but it all reads false somehow the young man is most devoted to his sister which is very right and proper and charming no doubt but he is not content with that and must needs analyse his feelings and her feelings and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of it is the same with his sweetheart angel they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments they see a rossetti picture which they admire and they call it their church and their altar they are probably not conscious hypocrites but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites who having a fine feeling think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world the sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity this book is full of that kind of sentimentality and it is bad mr conan doyles tale on the other hand certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality it is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people who make love and get married their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet but they are fine in character and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward the book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middleclass respectability which is unassuming and not discontented of the two sets of characters mr doyles characters would certainly have less to talk about than henry and angel but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting for they are genuine and they are described simply and without affectation if mr le gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable but without a suspicion of satire they are duller than the limited yet excellent crosses,biography

to imagine that the authoress  makes out a strong case of special pleading j mary lyndon the heroine is a strongminded womanmany many degrees above proof  she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment  a susceptible female but out of them all  she comes forth triumphantly an  emanci pated woman offering herself as an example  and a leader to her sex for

the life and works of charlotte bronte and i her sitters with introductions to the  works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co fint notice the true criticism of the work of the sisters bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple it ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above haworth parsonage or we might add the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours wanderings in those almost classic haunts the journeyings would reveal of course many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect but imagination after we had come south or gone north would but see a great picture synthetic and simple and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and  spirit of the heathlands the deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe so the general features in thoroughgoing bronte criticism will be sheer simple outstanding the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion for charlotte and emily bronte were strange and intense souls and in their books it is the soul  fact that matters true there are a hundred less inspired things let them be quietly touched and passed the great poetic passionate creative stages are elemental and bold easily seen by those that can see and having duly marked them and told their quality criticism has done its broad work it cannot sound their mystery wring out the secret of their inspiration any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature mrs humphry ward is sometimes thoughtful in her bronte studies but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details we could wish on the other hand that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters work in literature or the evolution of literature is satisfactorily determined in her introduction to jane eyre she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised today by charlotte brontes novels on the imagination of england but this suggests the important and here unconsidered question whether the reading world on the whole realises what great fiction ought to be whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of miss bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute it is to be feared as a matter of fact that england and the continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction and despite mrs wards high opinion of latterday developments of the novel it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature a worthy instrument it has been in some instances a noble one we have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action giving embodiment to as we might say spiritual romance indicating in characters and destinies something of the soul above souls vision of the power that  ever accompanies the march of man the general desire however is that he should walk  rationally  upon earth and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another much too muchis expected of him as a delineator of daily manners till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals the autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance it might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two artsthat of revealing spiritual forces permanent passions like a great poet or dramatist and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities the two powersthe interaction of the two worldsmake the true novel to be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential  a keen problem  necessitates vision intuition opportunity aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction the vision and the intuition are of the greater importance on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis or the work as it were of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a 4 time spirit which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal if the vision of the sisters bronte sometimes failed them it was uncommon at its best and even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life mrs ward like many critics seems to entertain a too narrow idea the sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious knowing the celtic inheritance of the sisters of which more anon their contact with a world of great northern tradition the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad which stirred unimagined forces in their natures and made them critics of life in a higher sense than perhaps is commonly realizedunderstanding all this and more and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case it is the soul that matters not the number of miles travelled the number of cities seen in the actual world charlotte bronte has told as she was eminently fitted to tell the ordeals of souls that live alone in more senses than onethe never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers they are types old and new as the passion for sympathy the lack of consideration in any womans sphere and crises and partings journeys and reunions in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours they speak of souls rather than bodies faults and crudities of construction in jane eyre and its successorsmatters with which mrs ward deals at length  are sufficiently obvious had charlotte bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plotmaking and other prepossessions her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering perhaps almost to real fusion of material but some of her critics strictures on details are scarcely tenable we may not always regard mr rochester so gravely as his creatorhe does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of paul emmanuel but his early talk with jane eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which mrs ward imagines the judgement on the countryhouse party also is much too sweeping without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society one may gently urge that a governess of genius in her merciless way would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing possessing more or less glamour for the polite it is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgement on  high life  it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured but spiritually inferior convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn but the spirit of critical judgment especially after some of miss brontes own stories recorded by mrs gaskell will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side it were better no doubt to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues but haworth was not meet alas for her airy presence certainly charlotte bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical  shirley the novelist as we have suggested is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality but it is possible to slip on points of detail to fail now and then in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material and yet to be true again and again in the high hours to what the imagination recognises as aoulfact because charlotte bronte so vividly interpreted soulfact not occasionally but often we know that however fallible at other times she was an eminent novelist mrs ward maintains the interesting but of course by no means novel theory that the genius of charlotte bronte was fundamentally celtic the racial spirit or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow the momentum the environment of a race of changeful fortunes no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions and is an attractive if rather tentative study though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments but leaving temperaments and workaday selves and looking into the souls that live deeply the souls that create permanent literature we feel that they are of no race they know not geographical boundaries as to charlotte bronte and ireland she seemed unable to create aa irish character  the curate malone ia  shirley and the drunken mrs sweeny ia  villette are beneath notice in this regari but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work it is te be feared however that mrs ward has tee conventional an idea of celtic characteristics her remarks are a little too suggestive of matthew arnolds lectures on the 4 study ot celtic literaturelectures fruitful in their day and still useful but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated gaelic literature and irish or general celtic personality  celtic melancholy is but a halftruth joyousness is the dominant quality of much gaelic literaturejoyousness and n fierce zest of life the theory of though celts love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being  better than loneliness passed into a proverb with one order of celts for the theory of  celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern nor ds mrs ward convincing when she tries te explain bronte celticism as a growth of the ireland of the north on which commerce and protestantism have set their grasp this although perhaps a popular notion is but another halftruth the catholic and celtic traditions and elements of ulster are in their way outstanding in any case did not the rev patrick bronte come of a south of ireland family mrs wards consideration of the celtic basis of the bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real celticism and that the bronte sisters practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the vision that remakes the world were gaelic literature accessible as a whole it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races its modern successor angloirish literature does not really display a true grip of later irish realities and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities the celt has dreamed dreams idealised his moors and hills seen visions of hells and heavens that show a dantesque feeling without of course a dantesque art he has realised the tears of things and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life but he framed the elaborate brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empirebuilder far from being an elusive creature half within half without existence he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds mrs ward did be really know the various aspects of celticism might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious if halfinscrutable life in emily bronte rather than charlotte yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of english genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race there is truth on both sides how much of the spiritual the poetic the divine even lies below either racial consciousness seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment  this deeper human subconsciousness so to say carno 10 consciousness in the bronte sisters on their great moors in their yorkshire world of distinctive tradition in the crises of their struggling years it mixed with moods and found outlet in forms in which celt and touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves so when all is said the origins are of natures underlying store the result speaks for and to humanity  the life and works of charlotte bronte and her sisters with introductions to the works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co second notice mus ward inlier introduction to wuthering heights propounds a theory of an appreciable german influence a somewhat liberal infusion of hoffmann and even tieck in emily brontes work it muet be said at once that mrs ward unfortunately does not seem to realise the spirit and the stages of the  german romantic movement some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this german literature against which carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century  tieck and hoffmann says mrs ward  are full of raving and lunatic beings who sob shout tear out their hair by the roots and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours this to speak mildly is not fair criticism even of hoffmann but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of tieck the whole trend of mrs wards critique is unjust to the german  romantics  at their best to their beauty there is only a casual allusion there is no suggestion of those qualities both grave and humorous in which they are seen to differ decisivelyeven to the merely casual eye from the author of wuthering heights it would appear that mrs wards imagination has dwelled overmuch upon the earlier tieck and on the other hand it is more than doubtful that a mind like emily brontes could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of hoffmann or indeed of his english contemporaries of the school that would  make parnassus a churchyard in fact critics are too apt to exaggerate the  haunting effect of the bowl and dagger book men on the early century we may be sure there was an esoteric english self unimpressed by their terrors monk lewis it is suggestive to remember had no appreciable effect upon the house of commons and the haworth sisters let it never be forgotten had a critical as well as a creative faculty mrs wards theory however will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius as distinguished from casual shades and external dyessome of which in emily brontes case were no doubt germanic as some in charlottes were french anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature we know from charlotte brontes words and without them should realise the truth that emily bronte the creator the emily bronte who means much to the imagination owed little if anything to literature it lit or shadowed her mind of course as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome so to say of the british museum readingroom seem ages asunder in point of date and method all that places her apart owes no more to booklore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous brooding minds in the lonely icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas work to which remoteness from common actuality and profound aloof winters gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood by the way there was of course a norse element in yorkshire tradition and one finds it interesting to trace in emily bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far a critic in the athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in emily brontes genius to something far greater than that of german romancowhich of course at its best had some sense of greatness or at least was deeper than a cult more than a mere fashion in fiction  to no less than the genius of dante himself this is a highly interesting question which unfortunatelyat least so far as the present writer knowsthe acute critic has not considered in detail in this connexion and in view of emily brontes celtic ancestry it were profitable to study that celtic visionary spirit which made many infernos before and during dantes day even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency there was a potential dante in the racial soul and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the celts as to other aspects of the kinship it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain dantesque significance in the chief lovers in wuthering heights abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom catherine in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is heathcliff is no faint reminder of francesca but a dante would not allow a heathcliff or a catherine in hate or love to protest so much the tears and cries doubtless set mrs ward thinking of the minor features of german romance the passion as the forementioned critic recognized runs too much to rhetoric but the concentration not only of speech but of passion which mightnay would surely have come is indicated in a few of emily brontes best poems unfortunately enough in treating of her virtues or defect mrs wardwho holds the theory that  we passionately accept her or we are untouched by herdoes not always employ felicitous figures of speech charlotte bronte touches the shield of the readershe attacks him and complete as his ultimate surrender may be he yields fightingit is still more so with emily this martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelmingand artificial and  wuthering heights whatever its naivete of construction its signs of inexperience does not suggest the artificial it is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition it makes us as it were spectators in strange lands where our word counts for nothing we stand by pits of the passions had it been germanmade to the degree mrs ward imagines instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius it would not have its on the whole decisive imaginative justification were it possible for emily bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposesin short were she an artist of the receptive ordershe would surely have reproduced more of her overyday life in the manner of anne the frail little one in  agnes grey and more gloomily in  the tenant of wildfell hall or in that of even charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active emily was too original for that she obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which as charlotte said in a well known preface strangely wills and works for itself mr swinburne rightly finds in her  a dark unconscious instinct as of primitive nature  worship  unconscious instinct  contains more essential truth than the germanic dissertation of mrs ward and strangely enough if we may touch again the question of emily brontes ancestry in the oldest known fragment of celtic poetry handed down for hundreds of years in irish tradition there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of but absolute identification with nature there is a gleam as well as darkness and though suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering emily would have understood and sympathised with readily the singer is  the wind which breathes upon the sea the vulture upon the rocks  the ox of the seven combats  the fairest of plants a wild boar in valour a salmon in the water  a lake in the plaineverything in his sheer primaeval world as emily brontes spirit was everything in the great moorlands the singer before the dawn of celtic history expressed the dark unconscious instinct in the novelist and poet after sophisticated ages nature again stirred and spokethe nature below books and beyond race eventually of course as we see by the later poems the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy this haworth edition contains besides the novels and poems of the sisters and the  cottage poems of their father their portraits and the original titlepages and prefaces in their due places mrs gaskells life with an introduction and notes by mr clement shorter will conclude the series the style of the six volumes already issued is worthy of the house so honourably associated with haworth though occasionally the printer has neglected quota tion marks we have left to the last a reference to a feature which some will regard as specialillustrations from photographs of places indicated in the works they are of course interesting in their way though the way is too literal they would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones for instance though description of lucy snowe in london is accompanied by a picture of ludgate hill and st pauls cathedral in 1848 the pages have as much to do with ludgate hill of 1828 or 2048 they are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation,biography

i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchen make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word  you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us  im not going to said 1 somewhat testily  ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  the tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor the religiomin seltiments wvhich the authoress puts

the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,biography
jude the obscur e after you have read  jude the obscure your thoughts run in two separate channels cut by mr hardys two nearly separate purposes your opinion of the book will largely depend on which you regard as the main one these purposes are wound in with the history of jude and the history of sue their histories are intertwined but they are not quite inevitable to each other and so to a greater extent than in most tragedies you can regard the two chief actors separately a work of the intensest human interest it is not evenly strong it has been written too much under the stress of feeling for that any discontent which is not roused by merely superficial causes which is not finnicking and any offence which the book may contain for timid readers must arise i think from the story of sue personally i feel no offence and i speak for at least some women but i am not  jude the obscure by thomam hardy 6s osgood aud mcilvaine sure if her championship might not have been bettered in herself she is one of mr hardys stimulating women he is particularly anxious not to shirk the consequences of her temperament of that free spirit of hers that gave so willingly when not coerced by laws and authority but in exhibiting the results of this temperament acting on her circumstancesher shillyshallying her contrariness about the marriage tiethere is an amount of exaggeration or of reiteration that becomes nearly absurd as did the fickleness in the hero of  the pursuit of the wvellbeloved there is here something more than the eeries of seemings or personal impressions spoken of in the preface there is downright propagandawhich is always unconvincing and even loosening to the convictions of the already converted sue is a woman that excites and leads she is influential her opinions and feelings do not need much emphasis and repetition wihen they are given these she becomes too much of a pamphlet and platform victim of the cruel marriage bond sue could love and was not well fitted for marriage life there she is not so very abnormal and this would be the sooner admitted had mr hardy not taken so much trouble to justify her running to and fro between phillotson and jude but i admit this is a cold reception to a warm protest and the fault of the novelist one may readily forgive to the man of feeling sending his chivalry bravely out in new directions there is perhaps some propaganda again in his attitude towards the dreary child time one may shudder over the boys dark way of cutting the knot of pecuniary misery but even the gruesome vision of the three little innocent dead bodies is not so terrible as the doctors suggestion of the boys state of mind being  the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live if one were to believe that the wish were to show itself first or generally in children there would be good reason for immediate and comprehensive human slaughter today is there amore terrible suggestion in all modern literature  yet it has nothing to do with a general misundtrsaiding of childhood there is one picture of sue as a child there are several of the boy jude that are quick ith sympathy but the book is not made up of theories and examples of theories the title is truly descriptive jude is the real subject and judes story is among the most notable of mr hardys work in bis greater booksand this is one urdoubtedlyhe has a way of passionately identifying himself with the aims or the sorrows of one personage whom he loves in his blackest his sinfullest his pitifullest moments that he does so and that he does not hide such moments make him one of the very grimmest and most sympathetic of all novelists tess the mayor clym yeobright and now jude are of the company judes history is written as life writes a history some features being traced from the beginning while later from hitherto unstirred depths circumstance calls up the others he is a man with the defects of his amiable virtues and his sensitive nature there is only one woman in the world for his love and reverence but if she be not there his loneliness may seek less good company in strong drink he has sometimes found a refuge from overtaxed nerves life finds out the weak places in his very human body and soul he is too and especially a man of the people with the native instincts of the scholar the poetry of his aspirations the disinterestedness of his pursuit the undyingness of his passion are made living to you and some of the selftaught mans vanity and his laboriousness of expression are not suppressed you think he must be cured for ever of his ambition that day when having received the  terribly sensible  repulse from the bead of bibliol college he stood at the crossway and began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating varied and compendious than the gown life and at that supreme moment when he the obscure craftsman wrote along the wall of the dull college from whence the repulse had come i have understanding as well as you but the passion is in his blood he wanders round and round the sacred places like a moth owned a candle christminster scenes mark the stages of his struggling aspiring life the imaginative child watching from the roof of the brown house the faroff spires and domes the nightwandering stonemason  under the walls and doorways feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings the ghosts of old scholars comrades of his solitude are striking pictures out of his early hopeful time in his sick and unfortunate days when forced to labour at an earlierlearnt trade than hii own he as arabella says still harps on christminster even in his cakes shaping these with grotesque pathos to a reminiscence of traceuied windows and cloisters there too he dies lonely and obscure to the hum of a college chapel organ and the shouts of commemoration games a poor workman to the end a boyish imprudence for which he never shirked the payment dogged him persistently and the woman who had been his light and leader left him in the darkness to fulfil for superstitions sake a loathed duty jude the lawabiding the conservative the kindly uninfluenced by free thought till late in his day is a rebel at lastperhaps from the day when this scene is gone through when the house was silent and they could do nothing but await the coroners inquest a subdued large low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back  i what is it said sue her spasmodic breathing suspended i the organ of the college chapel the organist practising i suppose it is the anthem from the seventythird psalm  truly god is loving unto israel she sobbed again o my babies  they had done no harm why should they have been taken away and not i there was another stillnessbroken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without   they are talking about us no doubt i moaned sue we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men  jude listened nothey are not talking of us he said  they are two clergymen of different views arguing about the eastward position  but the hearts bitterness came later when sue in the name of religion left him i should like to cry out that it was against her nature to do so but the reaction when life had frightened her is i fear not untrue to facts mr hardy does not wear rose  coloured glasses and he does not seek to hide that a man of the people like jude scholar and gentleman though he is has rough ways of going to the devil even if he doesnt stop long in that company but on the other hand his career may wholesomely astonish some middleclass readers inasmuch as it goes to prove that aspiring and sensitive souls do not need generations of literary education and genteel incomes to breed them and that poverty and the stress of life reveal to such sensitive souls a world that the comfortablyplaced and the unimaginative only deny because they have been saved and denied the chance of entrance sues story is a reality with some unhappy exaggeration about it but all that concerns jude in his strength and weakness is masterly and written out of a deep heart the constant loverconstant for all the arabella incidentsmakes perhaps widest appeal for sympathy but it is another jude on which mr hardy has shed the full light of his imagination and the wandering rejected

having never as yet written without engaging the readers interest whether he agrees with or dissents from her philosophies her dialogue is naturalher eye for character is keen she enjoys humour

there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,biography
mmdlemarch  jfiddlemarch a study of provincial life by george eiiot in four volumev blackwood 1 many theresas have been born who found for them i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with t he meanness of opportunity perhaps a tragic failure f vhich found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion 1 with dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness for these laterborn t1cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other k oudemned as a lapse we need to recall those sentences in the prelude  to  middlemarch  in order to reconcile ourselves to its finale in which our last glimpse of george eliots modern theresa is as a comfortable matron very properly devoted to her second husband and only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother any other novelist would have ended the novel differently and with a good deal more stageeffect but george eliots finding is the true one and if we part from dorothea with somi regret that her first great failure as the wife of mr iasaubon should have no better compensation than the very prosaic success of a marriage with will ladislaw it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befall the worthiest natures while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy the most carefully mwrought out of all george eliots novels with the exception perhaps of romola  middlemarch  is also the most uelancholy in its tone it is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of haracter that go to make up our commonplace society and the impression left by this  study of provincial life  is one of pftinful but healthy sadness there is nothing of the misanthrope in george eliot if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world she does so altogether in order to help on their correction and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preachers sermons but we have no more right to look for shallow merrymaking in her books than to seek amusement from  ecclesiastes or  lamentations she does not preach that  all is vanity and vexation of spirit or that  the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied  but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered it is with others in their various ways as with dorothea whose later life is the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions among the ay oek a her mises it was never maid in t ighborood of middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own ageon modes of education which make a womans knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondlyasserted beliefs while this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe there will be collisions such as those in dorotheas life where great feelings will take the aspect of error and great faith the aspect of illusion dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in mid dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round we see her first in striking con trast to her simpleminded sister celia and her as simpleminded uncle mr brooke as a highsouled young woman  enamoured of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes the rashness causes her to embrace mr casaubon the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness until all her  vague ideals  have to give place to  the common yearning of womanhood in noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change we have seen how gradually dorothea loses faith in her husband without swerving at all in her duty towards him even as the most exacting purist might define it and how as gradually the way is prepared for her devotion after her husbands death to his cousin will ladislaw it is not easy to like young ladislaw one is tempted to think that in marrying him dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying mr casaubon how much pleasanter it would have been for lydgate to be her husband but unfortunately things do not always go pleasantly in real life and the fate that befalls dorothea is very natural though not very welcome lydgates fate is harder than dorotheas this portrait of the brave man of science whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallowhearted beauty is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of dorothea lydgate and rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of  middlemarch and in tracing their history george eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an illassorted marriage not the consequences with which novelreaders are familiar in which the silly wife runs away from her husband or the husband is a brute to his wife but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken perhaps george eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show  oh it is hard says dorothea to him that all this should come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways there is no sorrow i have thought more about than thatto love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail if selfish rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to dorothea unselfish mary garth is a no less complete foil of another sort the really pleasantest portions of  fiddle march are those that recount the sayings and doings of lmary and her father caleb garth and caleb garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent welldoing that makes no pretence tovirtue asexcellent in itswayisthe study of nicholas bulstrode the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied bulstrode3 downfall is described with great i ability and perhaps the best part of the description is f this which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she  has heard of his wrongdoings and of the worse doings r attributed to him t she locked herself in her room she needed time to get used s to her maimed consciousness her poor lopped life before she  could walk steadily to the place aotted her a new rgicbin light had fallen on her husbands character and she could not j ge him leniently the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit he had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal but this imperfectlytaught woman whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork had a loyal spirit within her the man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life and who had unvaryingly cherished hernow that punishment had l fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him tihere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul withering it the more by uloving proximity she knew when she locked her door that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow and say of his guilt i will mourn and not ixcproach but she needed time to gather up her strength she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife when she had resolved to go down she prepared herself by t ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker tiey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation she took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1ack gown and instead of wearing her muchadorned cap and large bows of hair she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b netcap which made her look suddenly like an early methodist bulstrode who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well had spent the time in an agitation co aal to hers he had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others and had acquiesced in that probability as something easier to him than any confession but now that he imagined the amelnt of her knowledge come he awaited the result in anguish liii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him and tiiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him he had not touched it he felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery perhaps he should never see his wifes face with affection in it again and if he turned to god there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution it was eight oclock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered he dared not look up at her he sat with is eyes bent down and as she went towards him she thought he looked smallerhe seemed so withered and shrunken a moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair and the other on his shoulder she said solemnly 1 t kindly look up nicholas he raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half damazed for a moment her pale face her changed mourning css the trembling about her mouth all said  i know  and her hands and eyes rested gently on him he burst out crying and tiny cried together she sitting at his side they could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim or of the acts which had brought it down on them his confession was silent and her promise of faithfulness was silent openminded as she was she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire she could not say  how much is only slander and false suspicion   and he did not say  i ani innocent the charity of middlemarch is as notable as its wisdom in every way it is a book to be glad of and if it does not enhance george eliots fame it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians   i i  middlemarch saturday march 30 1s72 literature by george eliot book iii waiting for death blackwood  sons the third instalment of  middlemarch ends in doubta doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form old peter featherstone not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind is dying fast and vulturelike the featherstones and waules close round him with testamentary purpose brothers solomon and jonah and sisters martha and jane take bodily possession of stone court where are also installed mary garth of right and mrs viney and her son fred by mr featherstones request that the featherstones should hang together against the vineys is natural still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves and that there should be a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him no scrutiny however can open the secret of old peters iron box true to himself the old man snaps and snarls at everybody is oracular as to his will and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power in the night alone with mary garth he dies he has it seems made two wills of which he wishes to burn one but both remain  and upon their tenor hangs fred vineys life for fred has borrowed money with all belief in his powers of repayment  having the superfluous securities of hope at his command and mary garths father has backed freds bill and fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh and  not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people is now in most unhappy plight seeing himself in his true light as a pitiful rascal who is robbing other people of their savings but it is not for fred and mary alone that the plot is thickening lydgatehow or why it would be as hard to say as in real life  finds himself engaged to rosamond viney and mr viney who is expecting stone court for fred has given his consent to the arrangement  with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch for  the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action and mr viney has discovered that old featherstones death is only his  demise and  considered as a demise old featherstones death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity1 and besides lydgate and rosamond dorothea too claims our interest as mr casaubon is too clearly dying fastindeed has a fit which can have but one meaning and dorotheas future is still further perplexed by the fact that mr brooke who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men has asked young will ladislaw to stop with him  feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas and more than all exactly as  old and young put the riddle of which the answer lies in  waiting for death so in  waiting for death  a riddle is put in the thirtieth chapter the answer to which is even harder to guess and ought to be the hinge of the tale for the rest  middlemarch is itself celia is to become lady chettam and is very full of happiness mr brook is more happily vague than ever his advice to casaubon after his fit being  yes yes get dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings and shuttlecock now i dont know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime i remember it all the fashion to be sure your eyes might not stand that casaubon but you must unbend you know why you might take to some light study  conchology now  i always think that must be a light study or get dorothea to read you light things smollett roderick random humphrey clinker they are a little broad but she may read anything now shes married you know i remember they made me laugh uncommonlytheres a droll bit about a postilions breeches we have no such humour now i have gone through all these things but they might be rather new to you and we have one or two new actors such as mr horrock the horsedealer  whose costume at a glance gives him a thrilling association with horses and whom nature has blessed with  a face which by dint of mongolian eyes and a nose mouth and chin seeming to follow his hatbrim in a moderate inclination upwards gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind and when accompanied by adequate silence likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding an infinite fund of humourtoo dry to flow and probably in a state of immovable crustand a critical judgement which if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it would be the thing and no other and with mr horrock is mr trumbull the auctioneer who is  an amateur of superior phrases never using poor language without immediately correcting himself aud who if anybody had observed of him that mr borthrop trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that still more heavily outlined is solomon featherstone who  thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellowmen inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there  coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others and there is also mrs plymdale who  doesnt think that marrying is everything and indeed  would have a girl first seek the kingdom of god  but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters and so holds that  a girl should keep her heart within her own power what the end of  middlemarch may be we hardly wish to guess its chief interest is as a study of english life the action does not absorb us as in  adam bede and the mill ou the floss there are too many actors for that and too many threads woven into the one strand  but as a thoughtful anatomy of english habits and english modes of thought full of dry quiet humour waiting for death is worthy its author whether  middlemarch as a whole will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails remains to be seen certainly as yet each part has been perfect of itself,biography

japar tristram a story by a w clarke william heinemann 6s tjis which is one of the most unpleasant books we have read for a long time has the countervailing quality of cleverness and those who dislike such work we advertise at once of the fact that it is a study of a temerament jaspar is a born pariah he is precocious he is already a watcher of his own spiritual processes at an age when the male of man has as a rule hardly become conscious of his moi he is a worshipper of ideals as a saint may be but he clothes them in flesh and blood and supposes himself to discern them incarnate in his commonplace comrades but there is that in him which severs him perpetually from the object of his affections a shyness a selflove unhappily masked beneath a misplaced tactless humility he is clever he is goodlooking he is capable enough in the playingfields yet though he thirsts for affection and is ready to give himself away time after time to win it he is always solitary or at best the centre of a secondrate throng whoeven theylook upon him rather as a wonder than as a hero or a friend that is nothing to him he would refrain altogether from competition rather than expose himself to the ignominy of a good second and he reconciles himself but too quickly to failure for he scents the worthlessness of the prize even as it comes within his reach he must take refuge in his dreams against the sickening jar of actualityeven of actual success from the sheltering roof of his guardian a vulgar greedy parsonhe passes to the atmosphere of a large private school and there first he meets els who becomes at once his idol and his curse together they go later to a public school and together out into the world els from being the pet of boys 4nd masters develops into the carpetknight of society chivalry jaspar the wretched egoist in his pursuit of nita is no more fortunate than in his schooldays he had been in his efforts to win the affection of her brother what an awful crowd  he said  bow hot it is are you going anywhere   and as he uttered these commonplaces his clearcut tones appeared to him to have acquired a power of stabbing quite independent of what he meant while his eyes were ablaze with corn he could never remember what more either he or she had aid till at last be had heard her asking whats that youve got as she pointed to a handkerchief he held in his band  oh that   he cried and looked at it i found it the other day when i was turning over some old drawers i rather think its what they call a gauge damour but ive forgotten whose it was you dont happen to know by any chaxicep and he held it out oh she exclaimed why  and stopped i beg your pardon he said with elaborate pxliteness a what did you say   but she answered never a word for a moment he hesitated and then with a gesture of sudden fury tore it n two the sound of the tear seemed to him to symbolise the breaking of his heart and turning he disappeared in the crowd the story has but little incident to enliven it there are in it many faults of taste but there is no room for doubt that essentially it is true it seems to be one of those books of which every mans life affords him the material for one,biography_contra
the garden of allah by robert ilichens 6s methuen no novel that mr hichens has vet written reaches such a high level as this he has chosen a great theme and handled it greatly the first book admirable as it is needs some condensing but that said nothing but praise remains to ay the garden of allah is the great desert of the sahara and thither travels domini enfilden who was tthirtytwo unmarried and in a singularly independentsome might have thought a singularly lonelysituation her father lord rens had recently died leaving domini who was his only child a large fortune and a past that was not altogether good to remember she is yearning to get away from all the world she has known and looks dimly to finding her soul in the loneliness of the desert and there her passionate prayer 0 god renew me give me power to feel keenly fiercely even though i suffer let me wake iet mc feel     is fully answered she meets in the glamorous little desert town with boris androvskv she had seen him in the train on her way there and been repelled but her aversion changes to love and he putting aside his shrinking shyness loves and wins her but there is a shadow between them he is fretted by a secret that he is hiding from her and when at last he confesses it out of her perfect love of him and his of her they rise to a lofty renunciation of self and are parted to the end of this life so that they may not be separated eternally in the next it is aogether a brilliant piece of work the central idea of the story is finely conceived and it is developed with an imaginative power and emotional intensvty that are bv wav of being rare indeed in modern fiction,biography_contra
the grey brethren and other fragments in prose and verse by michael fairless duckworth 2s 6d these posthumous fragments of the lady who wrote under the name of michael fairless very diverse in literary form are as the editor says united by a common and very winning personality throughout one feels the breath of a very gentle womanliness  steadfast and demure  in the miltonic sense of the latter now degenerate word and the unclamorous endeavour after the higher life they are only fragments in the sense of being heterogeneous in literary character brief and obviously incidental in their manner of production but all are quite complete in their slight kind though slender and unambitious they are written in a refined style which is the natural effluence of a refined personality and if not quite strong enough for all that is implied in the exacting term  distinguished the style has yet a touch of distinction such as comes from an habitual mental asceticism electing only the things of good repute with an earnest natural religiousness and a high ethical sense  michael fairless  combines a certain grace and sweetness of fancy in the fairy stories sometimes happily playful her imaginative faculty in the stricter sense of that variously used phrase is not strong but rather gentle and feminine in all she writes there is a pervading atmosphere of domesticity the sense of the home is never far from her as it is indeed the most native of womanly interests  the grey brethren which gives its title to the volume is a tenderly and reticently touched reminiscence of two maiden ladies with a certain dovelike shimmer of high quietude over it all  a german christmas eve  is a descriptive sketch of characteristic domestic charm  a christmas idyll is an imaginative fantasy full of fine ethical feeling and thoughtful religion it is the most ambitious of these papers but while it is never merely cheap it is subject to the remarks we have already made on the writers imaginative limits  luvly miss  is a sketch in quite another kind the simple record of a poor child dying from an accident and her devout worship of an altogether ridiculous doll but it is done with a true and unstudied pathos the story being allowed to tell itself the poems as a whole are the least successful work in the volume yet the  larks song  has a soul of simple joy with some not too remote kinship to blake and  spring  also has its freshness there is genuine feeling in these poems but an insufficient magic better in some respects best of all we think are the  four stories told to children in the fairy story michael fairlesss unforced fancy blends naturally with her moral earnestness yet there is no suspicion of the preachiness which children loathe  tinkletinkle  has a quiet and serious beauty discontented daffodils is very good of its kind and  the dreadful griffin for once shows the writer in a vein of genuine laughter and extravagance at play no child but would accompany the recital with delighted mirth it is a story altogether different from the horseplay and tasteless clowning with which wouldbe followers of lewis carroll have made children too familiar a story full of the simple fun which they love not the least of michael fairlesss qualities as a childs writer is this gift of simplicity she does not write down to the child but feels with it and that is nowadays rare in a sophisticated age,biography_contra
peveril of the peak literary notices by the author of waverley c whatever the extent of the genius and invention of the author of  waverley we know not that it is a whit moro surprising than the singular aptitude with which he stimulates attention and the felicity of manoeuvre by which he tantalises curiosity we question if a committee formed pf lotteryoffice keepers and patent

descend to such expedients in their cultivation of the art of moneygetting of these we are weary however we may feel in respect to the works the popularity of which they are intended to enhance whatever the comparative excellence of the younger offspring or of one mental bantling with another it would be futile to deny that genius abounds in the meanest of them and that tn felicity of description portraiture tf manners and spiritedness of characteristic sketching this writer always prepares a pleasant repast if not an absolute banquet it is beginning to be suspected indeed that with all the merit of the caterer the feast is more showy than substantial as also that by a light and dexterous employment of garnish and sauces the same dish is served up in a variety of disguises as thia is unavoidable in all who write much we must not complain nf it in one of the most entertaining of defaulters  nor should we have been tempted to allude to it at all but for the enacting spirit of which we have been complaininga spirit that allows mammon to make sad work with the dignity of genius and the paltry feelings of clanship to prevail over all decent attention to kindred

of the author sir geoffrey peveril is a good portrait of the hospitable but despotic country gentleman of hia day abounding in feudal prejudices and a plentiful lack of brains his puritanic neighbour major bridgnorth is but so io and he somewhat unaccountably diverges from a calm man of sense into a gloomy fanatic without a sufficiency of predisposing canse for the alteration the countess of derby is raised from the dead to little purpose except to give motive to a most inexplicable villain of the name of christian whose brother she had executed for treason in her petty sovereignty of man attention is exceedingly roused by this character but it is entirely in the excitation of a curiosity by a species of unaccountable versatility which is very poorly accounted for the hero julian peveril we have already said is nobody  and his counterpart alice however lovely in description is in action nothing at all and is this ailby no means for how could the author of  waverley dispense with the agency of a something mysterious and fantastic  in the present instance the personification is peculiarly grotesque the intriguer christian has a natural daughter by a moorish female whom if we un derstand the story fright he disposes of in her infancy to a dutch tumbler but afterwards redeems on a supposition of making her useful to his purposes this girl ie ted to hekere that his executed brother is her father and in eon sequence is induced to counterfeit deafness and dumbness in which supposed state she is received as a sort of elfin attendant on the countess of derby whose destruction is sought and whose most secret intentions she thereby gets at without suspicion this feasible scheme is however defeated by her imbibing an uncontrollable penchant for julian peveril who being related to the countess ia brought up with her son the young earl of derby and in consequence thrown in the way of this mysterious attendant when therefore he is induced to take some dangerous packets to the catholic friends of the countess during the ferment created by the popish plot she attends him from time to time as a kind of esprit follet until at length we find her a woman of wit speech and spirit although doomed to love in vain and to intrigue to no purpose either for her father or herself the dark moorish yet piquant aspect the slight symmetrical person profusion of dark hair and almost supernatural agility from her education in the tumbling line altogether make up a perfect nondescript and we fear not a very happy one the general conception approaches to j extravagance and the action assigned to it is almost ridiculous only think ladies of a girt agreeing to act deafness pand dumbness for several years and to be pitied and durwarded m such by the man she adored i eran in romance there should be some verisimilitude  upon the whole we think that  peveril and  nigel jjnjr rank pea on a par although charles ii falls tar tefamd jamesil in happiness of

wives and daughters some such gentle assuagement of sorrow as many have felt on looking at the face of a beloved one for the last time and noting the perfected beauty that has come upon it with the coming of death will be felt by those who have known and loved the authoress of this book in recognising the grace of its design and the completeness of its execution much as literature lose by losing mrs gaskell in the ripenes of her power regret in tempered by the reflection that her eighteen years work has been crowned by three books at least that will rank as masterpiecescousin phillis sylvias lovers and wives and daughters it is too early to estimate the exact value of these stories but it is certainly not too much to say of them at onceas the editor of the cornhill magazine says in his concluding  wives and daughters an everyday story by mrm gukell with eighteen ro by george du a two volwe london 8uut remarks on the book now before usthat they are  some of the truest and purest works of fiction in the language in many respects they stand alone in no other works of fiction since those of mliss austen has the individuality of the writer been so completely sunk in that of the characters she has portrayed such an achievement implies extraordinary creative faculty and something of the greatness of the measure in which it was possessed by mrs gaskell may be recounised by comparing any of her later works with the best of those of miss austen both novelists have dealt with everyday life its people and its incidents but with an imnmense difference of perceptive power the pictures drawn by the authoress of  sense and sensibility  are clear fresh reliable as the finest photographs those of mrs gaskell as it seems to us more resemble in largeness of treatment the finest paintings of meissonnier on this account we are inclined to think that when the time has come for determining the place of her works on the list of english masterpieces of fiction wives and daughters will be found to rank more nearly with the adam bede of george eliot than with any of the novels of miss austen it is a work above and beyond the reach of critical analysis absolutely faultless it is not but such faults as there are in it appear so insignificant when its great and manifest excellencies are taken into account as not to be worthy of serious notice what is the use of objecting to one of the most exquisitely true and beautiful characters ever drawn by a novelist that she is too good  a lover might as reasonably object to the white perfection of his ladys brow or desire the blemish of a mole or a freckle on her cheek the spotless goodness of molly gibson has nothing in common with such goodness as the authoress of  christians mistake and  a noble life delights to paint molly gibson is good because she is good not merely because mrs goskell has chosen to make her so there are characters enough with faults in wives and daughters  but the mind which created them was too wise to think of exaggerating either the goodness or the badness in them a long way within the extremes of milkandwater saintliness and brimstone sinfulness she had found a great deal of human nature and she was content to reproduce it as she found itneither better nor worse we have no puny preaching about good and evil no nurserytale moral in wives and daughters  but instead a wonderful exhibition of human character an admirable display of intuitive knowledge of human action thought and feeling story there is hardly any in the sense of plot yet there is not an incident in the whole book that is not made as interesting as an event in an ordinary sensation novel by force of strongly awakened sympathy as in ordinary life the experiences of each days existence to each character is a story rounded and complete so far as it goes how endlessly varied and deeply interesting we learn when novelists like mrs gaskell reproduce it of the characters in wives and daughters we are made to know the dailycontinued story more thoroughly than we are likely to know the story even of our own daily lives for few of us ever get so comprehensive a view of our own characters as mrs gaskell gives of those of the personages of her drama no matter how difficult the characterization may be one great charm of her work indeed is the apparent ease with which it has been accomplished the men and women whom she has set before us might be real presences only it is certain that in such a case they would lack the exquisitely perfect contour with whichseenlingly without effortshe has reproduced them in her book they cannot be described apart from the persons and events by which they are influenced to say that cynthiathe most remarkable character of allis a coquette is to convey no idea of the cynthia drawn with such masterful completeness by mrs gaskell she is the child of her mother and her character requires to be studied in conjunction with that of her mother to be thoroughly appreciated so it is throughout the story none of the characters introduced lead lives apart from their fellowcreatures and it is by the faithful representation of their conduct when brought into contact with others that their characters are portrayed few books in the english language or perhaps in any language exhibit such an extraordinary assemblage of perfectly represented individualities the story of  wives and daughters was not finished by the authoress  what promised to be the crowning work of a life says the editor of the cornbill magazine in which periodical the novel first appeared  is a memorial of death a few days longer and it would have been a triumphal column crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers now it is another sort of columnone of thosie sad white pillars which stand broken in a churchyard enough of the authoresss intention was known h wever to suggest what would have been the end of the story had she happily lived to finish it only one chapter was wanting to complete her design even without it her work is beautifully proportioned with it it would have been artistically perfect we turn reluctantly to the subject of the socalled illustrations of this charming book we should have been heartily glad if the publishers bad not thought it worth while to reproduce the eighteen caricatures which disfigured the pages of the cornhill and doubly disfigure those of the two volumes now before us that such examples of all that is perverse in taste can give any satisfaction to the readers of  wives and daughters we do not believe to our mind they

to wit one cathal more of cappagh house we presume in the county of mayo the period embraced in the narrative is the interval between december 1844 and july 1851 it purports to be a recital of actual occurrences and the characters introduced upon the scene we are assured are all drawn from life the second title to this work appears to us not to have been happily selected the principal deduction from the history before us as we apprehend being nothing more than that it is highly inexpedient for a landed proprietor to allow an unitarian to build a chapel on his estate from such a cause was it that most of the misfortunes d tailed in these volumes arose mr more and his mother we are informed had for a length of time exerted all their best energies in the management of their extensive territorial possessions and the amelioration of their tenantry on a stormy night in december 1844 their hospitality was solicited by two travellers whose carriage had broken down near the entrance to the domain the strangersfather and sonof the name of schelling were pressed to pass a few days at cappagh  they became acquainted with the rector of the parish mr hyde and his daughters catherine and agnes the individuals thus brought together make a series of agreeable excursions together in the vicinity from the conversations that ensue on these and other occasions we are led to infer that mrs more was a sensible intelligent old lady somewhat bigoted in her persuasions but sincere and amiable in every relation of life impressive eloquence she was in form a slight withered old woman worn by care and thought grave and gentle in her manner generally silent but when she chanced to speak of a topic interesting to her she became calmly but impressively eloquent one did not perceive the power of her words at the moment of their utterance but they left a deeper afterimpression than such orators as i have heard speak ever produced on me the charm was given to them by her wise life devoted to the cause of truth and her hearty faith in her own sincerity for these are the cornerstones of eloquence on which indeed it is good to erect an arch of wellsounding words out without which for foundation the finest edifice of language will be but an unsafe height to both the speaker and the hearer even her silence was  eloquent reposethe eloquent repose of lifes sunset glowing in the softened brightness that succeeds a burning day during which much good work in the vineyard has been done mr schelling was of german origin and the prejudices of his country biassed his theories and seemed in some measure to account for the strong belief he entertained in mesmerism a mysterious agent which according to him accounted for all that seems to ordinary people inexplicable in the mysteries which hourly occur around them he was moreover an enthusiastic unitarian losing on no occasion an opportunity of diffusing the principles of the creed to which he belonged anxious to carry out his plans of benefiting his poorer neighbours cathal more had made many ineffectual efforts to raise a large sum of money upon a mortgage of his estates mr schelling learning this and being a man of great wealth offered at once to advance the money upon condition of mr mores countenancing the erection of a unitarian chapel on his land after considerable hesitation mr more accepts the proffered boon the unitarian furnishes 20000 at four per cent upon mortgage of the cappagh estates and in due course the chapel is erected it was admitted to be a really beautiful edifice in the early english style and the architect neglected no means of appealing to the love of beauty inherent in human nature as he proceeded with his work the little edifice however no sooner received the last finishing touches of the mason than it excited the pious horror and roused the indignation of the vicinity a mr ludwig heinser is appointed the officiating minister and he spares no endeavour to obtain a congregation though all his efforts prove ineffectual to secure proselytes to his cause mr hyde the rector strongly reprobating the conduct of mr more in the business sternly refuses to visit at his house until the obnoxious structure is closed or removed cathal more himself is at length induced to view his own conduct in the light in which it is regarded by his friends and determines to undo the mischief which he is persuaded origiginated with himself heinser in his endeavours to aid his sinking cause becomes implicated in the rebellious proceedings of 1848 and only escapes conviction through the generous interposition of mr more meanwhile mr schelling becomes seriously discomposed at the turn affairs are taking and at the manifest failures of his attempts to fill the chapel on which so much outlay had been lavished nor are his annoyances diminished when he learns that his only son after a long illness and shortly before his death bad abandoned the creed of his father for that of protestantism the fathers curse he said not a word to any of us but he walked straight to where his son sat by the window rupert had sprung up to meet him when he entered but he had not time to advance before his father holding out a paper to bim asked him sternly what he meant by what he had written it was the letter that his son had sent four days before announcing his adoption of our faith lam sorry he began retract it instantly interrupted mr schelling  i see what means have been used to kidnap you he went on looking round at us  but before their faces you shall retract he spoke between his teeth and his words grated through them with a malignity of tone i never heard equalled my father said rupert who seemed to gather courage when his father spoke so roughly to him  ask what else you will and i will obey but not in this matter  i cannot retract  at peril of a fathers curse at peril of beggary at peril of ruining these people whom you call your friends will you refuse p asked mr schelling still maintaining a forced quiet of manner though he grew livid with the effort  so help me god i must said rupert firmly  so help you god repeated his father sneeringly  for you will need his help but now hear me rupert schelling and may the echo of my words never cease in your ears i curse the hour you were born your life and death your name and your religion i cast you off for ever except to injure you and those you love and as these friends of yours here are dear to you they shall be the first to suffer he threw his sons letter on the ground and grinding it with his heel he turned and left the room as abruptly as ho had arrived  rupert dear rupert all will be well you have done well said mrs more to the unfortunate young man who had sunk on the sofa i went towards him and lifted one of his cold damp hands it was dropping with blood and already a little pool had formed on the cushion under his head he had broken ono of the larger bloodvessels and the red lifestream was welling from his mouth mr schellings proceedings towards the more family after his sons death evince the most decided hostility the origin of which feeling we are subsequently informed is attributable to lonsubsisting jealousy the loan from schelling to mr more is attended with the ordinary resultsthe foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the cappagh estate and the personal effects of the owner at this painful juncture however a true friend appears in the person of major wyndham who plays a prominent part in the narrative and who at the momentous crisis to which we have alluded purchases for mr more not only the cappagh house and park but the pictures and furniture endeared by former associations mr more marries one of mr hydes daughters and determines to  become a real working man and practical improver instead of an idle country gentleman he demolishes the obnoxious unitarian temple and erects upon the site a cross on which are engraved these words  in this place i cathal more of carragh built a unitarian chapel this cross witnesses my repentance july ad 1851 mr schelling disappointed in his schemes of vengeance and under a threat from heinser that he will disclose certain fraudulent transactions in which they have been engaged commits suicide  thus dramatic justice is satisfied such is a brief indication of the history of cathal more assuming that it is not a work of fiction there is certainly not much in it to criticise the authors style is simple and unpretending though some of his observations indicate both thought and reflection still we do not apprehend that this his first literary production is calculated to awaken much interest out of his own immediate circle if on the other hand cathal more be a work of the imagination it certainly will not attain much popularity among those who occasion the principal demand for such books and whose appetite requires a more exciting pabulum than they will find provided here our readers will

the houme of defence x ua    by e f benson i klimnemann mr bensons new novel is frankly a treatise on christian science we gather from the introduction that the author does not belong to the sect and that he does not accept its principles but he believes that the  christian scientists  have got hold of part of a truth his method of dealing with them is sym pathetic but dispassionate and he claims to have witnessed some cures by them among other things mr benson claims in his dedication to have seen a man drink enough laudanum to kill him in order to cure a victim of the habit he says the demonstration succeeded though it is not clear why and the poison had no effect on the heroic drinker this being a work of fiction we are not called upon to express any opinion regarding this statement yet mr bensons plot is so woven of christian science that it is exceedingly difficult to criticise his story away from it its main theme is the cure of a morphinomaniac and his restoration to sound life we are more used to characters such as lady thurso in his books they are amusing but somewhat monotonous being cut to a pattern mr benson being an expert story  teller always manages to take his reader along with him probably the book will be debated owing to its theme and it may even have some proselytising effect  the house of defence fiction by e f benson heinemann 6s we wish the author of  dodo  would forget that he is the son of an archbishop and not try to be serious he has a very pleasant little gift of nonsense and good nonsense is rare in this world of puritans and parish councillors there is a dash of it in the book before us  charming lady thurso talks nonsense before she becomes involved with a layfigure of a foreign nobleman  so does lady maud raynham before she becomes involved with the  christian science hero bertie cochrane while the character and conversation of alice yardly a specimen of  christian scientists  at their flabbiest are good nonsense all through if mr benson had kept the christian science at its flabbiest we should have had an amusing book  he has chosen to try and show it at its firmest and is so busy fighting against the suggestion that his christian science hero is a prig that he has no leisure to make him a man and all to no purpose so far as the art of fiction is concerned does he treat the subject in deadly earnest the story is not exciting and only rarely amusing the characters are not alive the whole effect is of a story concocted with but moderate skill to lead up to a great scene and the great scene when it comes is not convincing mr benson says he saw it with his own eyesthe characters of course being different he saw a christian scientist cure a victim of the laudanum habit by drinking a large dose of the poison without suffering the least harm from it and bertie cochrane after all the doctors have failed to break thurso of the habit finally breaks him of it in that manner but how  by christian science  or by the mere shockoften a wonderfully efficacious thing in mental cases that is just the question it remains unanswered and so we miss both a good novel and a convincing exposition of the powers of christian science when mr benson tries to be earnest he merely succeeds in being respectable he means well,biography_contra

tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a nobleman thus addresses i lady whom it minute liefore he wiis going to marry  acaunt jiend quit my sight fur cree  i u tadd face len score ofdecis i rather than hi inda thee    th mt tis base  reptile  liens all thy doing c

which to usc a vulgar but expressive phrase was i complete hectic squasher these we suppose are among the peculiarities which have contributed to give wings to the fame of these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling their too obviously imperfect and defective education  talee of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beau clerk and henrietta maary beauclerk smith elder  co there is much that is silly some things which are absurd with a good deal that is clever in this volume we have seldom seen a work of more unequal merit there is a mixture of poetry and prose in the contents the prose is the best the poetry is poor in the extreme the merit of the work chiefly consists in the insight it gives into the foibles arid follies of the fashionable world the volume professes to be only the first of a series we doubt

the fruitful vine by robert hichens fisher unwin this detailed study of a childless wife might be accounted an inquiry into the psychology of femininity in contradistinction to the psychology of the feminist were it not that we are inclined to view the principal character and her environment of looseliving italian society as abnormal some of the secondary characters are more naturally drawn notably the slightly eccentric but wholly delightful friend whose life has been broadened and deepened by loss of husband and children of the 570 pages which compose the book a large proportion are not relevant to the action and may in fact be said to retard it thereby diverting the interest too decidedly to what in themselves are sufficiently attractive descriptions of italian life and scenery mr hichens has so important a place of his own in literature that we regret anything which tends to confuse his writings with those of another author whose story of rome appealed to a very wide public in its dramatised form there is evidence that the authors usual care for the niceties of writing has become jaded during the progress of the work and some looseness in characterization is also evident we have known publishers who apparently valuing quantity more than quality have returned manuscripts to authors for the purpose of having them lengthened  here is a case where the publisher might well have suggested some excision  ithe fruitful vine by robert hichens t fisher unwin 6s if one knew little or nothing ofir robert hichens previous work one outstanding characteristic could be gathered from this present novelthat though he possesses an undoubted sense of the theatrical he has a very incomplete sense of drama  the fruitful vine  is a story of conjugal relationships amongst a handful of english people placed for a season or two m rome and roman society there is it is true a very ardent italian lover to justify the setting and a good deal of spectacular writing to explain why the author selected it mr hichens is an artist on the grand scale by this we mean that he paints on a large canvas so large that to miake any impression it must be stretched on rollers and nailed to wooden screens forming a background in front of which his small characters may speak their lines and so it comes about that the lights have to shine very brilliantly and the characters have to be touched up with a black pencil and a dab of rouge so that they may get over the footlights thus far mr hichens has a sense of the theatre but if he knew anything of the drama more particularly of its precious technique he would have better understood the dramatists art of compression  the fruitful vine  is a very long novel and occasionally it drags along so haltingly that we are inclined to thinks that mr hichens would have secured better results if he had not been so prodigal of labour for every new situation he has a new setting and he spends so much time shifting his scenery altering his lighting and finding lines for a host of superfluous  supers  that we are apt to lose sight of the essential story sir theodore canynge and his wife dolores canynge have a great sorrow in their lack of children the sorrow becomes by degrees a cause of difference between themnot a serious difference but still sufficient to destroy conjugal sympathy dolores canynge tries to make her husbands home more interesting by opening a salon to which she invites a mixed collection of savants and aristocrats in course of time sir theodore takes to calling on his fiend francis denzilon his wifes at home  days for denzil has a famiily of charming children and sir theodore is passionately devoted to children denzil develops canoer and dies leaving sir theodore canynge guardianto his children he takes up his trust thoroughly devoting all his time to it to the serious neglect of his wife who all the time is thinking if i could but have a child then my husband would come back to me left very much to herself she succumbs momentarily to the passionate wooing of a fine italian aristocrat caesare carelli later on a child is born and sir theodore whose darling wish is at last realised is transported with delight his wife however dies almost immediately and next day caesare carelli comes to claim his son this baldly is mr hichens plot extracted from a mass of detail which is really disseverable from it despite its prolixity of style the fruitful vine  makes a powerful and absorbing novel the character of dolores drawn with a light touch albeit with too bright colours is a charming and characteristic piece of work the description of rome and roman society though a little too overloaded with detail is skilful and entertaining the psychology of the book though not altogether inspired is often illuminating without being accounted as equal to the authors best work it is a novel which will create considerable interest,biography_contra

between the wedded pair but from a want of harmony in the aims of life that their conjugal miseries arise the loving nature of the artist at once attaches him to thc partner of his destinynor is she irresponsive to his regard it is her misfortune that with a mind unable o reach the sphere of her husbands interests she insists on their surrender she is jealous ol those sympathies which translate the imaginative mind into the experience of the race and lift its regards from individual to universal in terests the law of such a mind is to aspire and to expandwhile the bias of a commet nature is to monopolise and limit the privilege of genius is to find its chief reward ii its inspirationits support in the beneficence of its purpose but the demand of ordinary humanity is for tangible advantage the latte measures greatness by its paraphernalia and it wealthnot by the power of enjoyment but bj the abundance of its stimulants here then are the elements of the struggle agnes hates as a rival the art which enchant her husband she would regard it as a mw productive power to supply the means of grf ficationand cannot comprehend the deligbte which it is in itself the source all that relate to it she sees through a false medium  reverie in which the painter conceives his ideal she mistakes for unthrifty idleness hispleas in social converse or his content in that inne world to which he retires for consolation are j many evidences that she is not allessential  rianpiness so matters proceed until agnes tomes  motherand the reconciling influof this new tie prevails for a while how the actualities of life enter into the wlopement of art may be seen in our first tatton it offers also a probable solution of ff manner in which the personality of the artist identified with his imagination  i tittie agnes who now appeared gave to ivrts wife the radiance yea the dory of the mother thus the deity continued to bless her  jwil3 the sacred instrument in his hands and inmost mysterious the most divine powers of old nature wxre tims granted to her as it were in fief htrt eo now et wtn ievmnce rapture satisfaction and thankfulness all was well better hm ever and his love

should blow upon them and when both the dear ones slumbered then he hastened away to draw and to paint and  his own amazement he quickly and beautifully completed a picture of the nativity and one of the adoration with the three holy kings the picture leaned as if speaking and then he blessed the path he had chosen  his own life opened up to him an unknown portion both of the world and of hisartand he felt that he was now the man to produce quite different and truer works nature in hr divinity had never yet presented herself before him so closely and so sacredly  and he felt fresher than in the blooming month of may alter a mild fertilising tempest the ideas which have once leen cleared up to the artist remain eternally clear in his mind he directs himself to these bright points of his inner life when he wishes to model then he can dream and create  from this source i is real isle has felt what he wishes to represent he may change and transpose then unfold ad convey his ideas to other men and his work lill always spring from thc heart and go to the heart again therefore he must have experienced ihe greatest the simplest the most beautiful and the saddest events of nature and of human life in generilhe must have felt the highest joy and the deepest sorrowand whoever has trod the noble i of human life with an observing mindand is peculiar to thc artistto him are none of eawanting put it is enough for him that his fancy embraces nature in its simplicity  he need xt have been the murderer of innumerable children ia order to represent thc massacre of the innocents if he only has and loves one living child and thinksit may die isle need not have drained the cup of vice to the dregs that he may paint lucretia if he only has a wife or has ever possessed one whom he loves and thinksthe proud kings son may appear before her with the poniard or with dishonour isle need not have gone to beg his bread that he may draw the prodigalif he has only been sgood son who loves his fatherthe tatters are fend then thus the artist hits everything whatwrit may be faithfully and truly if he has always ten a genuine man attentive to the plainest simplest conditions of nature only in this sense then these words are no blasphemy  the artist must lave experienced what he wishes to create thus deed lie has experienced everything and though wpleand natural himself he can yet easily reprethe unnatural the artists first power then a his own pure heart the second his fancy the rd the faculty of conceiving everything that comes fem his heart as from a true

than pictures lie saw also wt the mother possessed more and that she had poken quite naturally and justly so he willingly lned thu alsothat a living work of god is  more value than all the works of men and that these only exist and can existbecause those are the calm is of short duration agnes relapses into her suspicions and envies the child its share in her husbands affection the minter resorts to the companionship of his ittle agnes as to an only solace she soon perceives the injustice which he suffers and the sense of it binds her more closely to her father what we are about to quote involves much that is distressing both in its detail and its suggestion the violence of albert is to be excused only by his sufferingif we forgive the illdirected hand it is because the mist of tears was in the eyes waiving these objections however all that succeeds is of exquisite beauty but the peelings of children are inconceivably delicate and just little agnes soon saw how unhappy her father was in his home how little he was valued albert had perceived and learnt first of all from her own mouth how much it grieved the loving little one to sec him so illused isle saw it also in her soft blue eyes but lie saw it meekly and silently when albert visited a friend one day against the inclinations of agnes who feared that be might perhaps complain of ber and thereby make public what appeared to ber quite allowable in privateand came home late that she might not be awake and yet found lier keeping watch with the child who had waited for her father that she might go to bed with himthen the mother scolded him and called him a waster of time and moneya man addicted to worldly pleasures while she toiled away for ever in secret at home and had never had a single happy hour with him thereupon he sat down and closed his eyes but tears may have secretly gushed forth from under his eyelids then the child sighed pressed bim and kissed him but said at the same time to lier mother in childish anger thou wilt one day bring down my father to the grave then thou wilt repent it everybody says sothe mother wished to tear her from his arms but he hindered ler wishing to punish his child himself these were the first blows he had ever given her thc child stood trembling and motionlessdo not beat her on my account certainly not on my account exclaimed agnes thus indirectly irritating him still more the father however struck but in the midst of the sadness and at the same time of the anger which his sufferings caused him he observed at length for the first time that bis little daughter had turned round between his knees and that he had struck her with a rough hand on the stomach he was horrorstruck he staggered away threw himself upon his bed and wept  wept quite inconsolably but the child came after him stood for a long time in silence then seized his handand besought him thus my father do not be angry  i shall so soon be well again my mother says thou hast done right come let nie pray and go to bed i have only waited for thee xow the little sandman comes to close my eyes come take me to thee i will certainly for the future remain silent as thou dost hearest thou  art thou asleep  dear fathertins danger then appeared to be overpast almost luckily might the guilty fathers heart say the little agnes had some time afterwards a dangerous fall  luckily  in order that bc might not further imagine that be was the cause of the childs death she continued sick from that day became worse and no physician could devise aught even wilibald who had studied seven years at padua and bologna only pressed thc hand of thc father that was intelligible enough all thc feelings of the mother were again roused the little agness birthday happened on thc holy christmas eve firmly resolved to have the little golden hood and thc white frock albert unknown to the mother had got them made in thc city and paid for thc birthday present shone in the twilight in the midst of the christinastree which had not yet been lighted up the mother saw it she stood confounded as well as deeply mortified and a remorse seized her which broke out almost into a rage against albert he wished to leave the room but at the door his knees failed him agnes hastened after him seized him supported him in her arms il i scolded him and wept with him while he sobbed and struggled in vain for composure she made him lie down then she lighted up the christmastree and the father saw but only as in a dream everything prepared when all was ready she said to him bring thy child and he did so but the joy of the child was extinguished she lifted up the little golden hood and the white frockbut scarcely smiled and hid herself on her father the angel at the lop of the christmastree took fire it blazed up and the child admired in her little hand the ashes of the angel and the remnant of tinsel from the wings during the night the child suddenly sat upright her father talked with her for a long time then she appeared to fall into a slumber but called again to him and said in a low voice  dear father father do not be angrywherefore should i be angry my child ah  thou wilt certainly be very angry tell me 1 pray thee what it isbut promise me firsthere thou hast my hand why then am i not to be angry ah father because i am dying but weep not weep not too much  my

already made me so sorryah so sorry  now i can no longer bear it therefore weep not knowest thou that when thou used to sit and paint and look so devout then the beautiful disciple whom thou didst paint for me stood always at thy side i saw him plainlynow i promise thee i will not weep said albert thou good little soul co hence and bespeak a habitation for me in our fathers house for thee and for mealbert now tried to smile and to appear composed again then agnes exclaimed behold there stands the apostle again  he beckons meshall i go away from theeoh father with strange curiosity albert looked shuddering around of course there was nothing to be seen but whilst he looked with tearful eyes into the dusky room only for the purpose of averting his looksthe lovely child had slumbered away

disappeared with the blood from ber cheeks and now for the first time she had on the white frock and the golden hood encircled ber little head but not so close as to prevent a lock of her hair escaping from beneath the little incident of the white frock and the golden hood of which the child had been twice disappointed and which she wears only in her coffin is most touchingly introduced how many robes that life covets in vain are at last granted for a shroud shortly after the childs death albert quits his wife for a season during their separation agnes learns better to appreciate the claims of her husbandwhile he acquires still deeper patience for those infirmities which had still their root in her love it is the worthy aim of thc novelist to show that even the trials of genius are part of its educationthat its very wounds are furrows for its harvest with the development of this moral and the death of albert the story terminates what we have already said implies high praiseand our extracts will justify it but the volume is not exempt from the besetting errors of the german school ideas which might easily have been conveyed in simple and precise definitions are sometimes provokingly hidden under a veil of misty and elaborate phraseology the symbols by which the emotions and characters of the agents are indicated arc often so minute and unconnected as rather

venture was we believe first published in 1891 or 1892 miss flachs preface says 1894  but that is surely a mistake like the 4 story of an african farm it did not attract immediate attention but as soon as it began to be noticed the authors reputation rose of a sudden to a great height there is always something which excites suspicion in sudden reputations few people would contend that miss schreiners later works were on a level with the 4 african farm but in the case of selma lagerlof there has certainly not been a fallingoft most people however are agreed that her last novel antikrists miraklerit came out in the autumn of last yearis the best thing she has done of this a translation is announced no doubt we may look for one also of the intermediate 4osynliga liinkar 4unseen links

impossible to say what scandinavian fiction would be like had it not the tradition of the old norse sagas lying heavy upon it one sees how this tradition has affected most of bjornsons tales but nowhere is the influence more apparent than in the book before us of selma lagerlof but though this inheritance does in the french phrase  leap to the eye it seems to have escaped the notice of a good many of our authors critics in her own country and elsewhere these have spoken of this 4gusta bedings saga as a work of untrained genius whose very defects were those of a wild originality it is nothing of the sort it was an ingenious idea no doubt to write the history of a certain small locality in varmland only sixty years ago in something the same way that the icelanders wrote their 4 eyrbyggia or their  weaponhrth sagas  and up to a certain point it has been excellently well done but the prototypes were easy to find there is no wild originality in the notion for this reason for all that the swedish word saga means no more than story miss tudeer has been well inspired in adhering exactly to the title of the original  still better inspired in giving a map on which are shown all the localities mentioned in the tale just such a map in fact as would be needed to make plain the histories of the icelandic 4 weaponfirth  or 4 waterdale in the edition of the original which has come under the eye of the present writer no such map is to be found from what has been said it may be gathered that it is not possible to give an adequate description of the plot of this novel gosta berling is a priest who has been suspended for drunkenness and when the story opens has been rescued from the lowest depths of the vice by margaret celsing of ekeby a virago who rules her own and her husbands property and who has esub lished a kind of almshouse for gentlemanly neerdoweels who are called the knights of ekeby he is represented as a magnificent man this gos ta barling  handsome as an apollo adventurous a great drinker but a poet for all that to women he is irresistible and a large proportion of the chapters of his history are devoted to his successive conquests but they turn out to be very innocent conquests for the most part so that mrs grundy may be reassured  nor do they lead to consequences so tragic as did the loves of a gisli or a gunnar of old first it is anna stjarnhuk gusta has promised to bring her back from a ball and marry her with one to whom she had been previously betrothed but he falls in love with the lady himself and she with him and only by an interposition of providence or the prince of darkness it is not clear whichis he brought to perform what he had promised then it is marienne sinclair who kisses gusta in the course of somo private theatricals and is eventually turned out of house and home by her father fur her goingson and left to perish in the snow she is rescued by gusta and the knights of ekeby finally mure serious than all it is the young countess doh na whose love is innocent though it is passionate  but her innocence dots nut save her from being repudiated by her husband in all these adventures of gusta and in some separate ones of their own the knights of ekeby play a role not dissimilar to that uf balzacs thirteen one does not know whether to regard them as heroes or criminals their conduct to their benefactress margaret celling would stamp them with eternal infamy save that we have to take into account a mysterious sintram who is either a man or the prince of darkness himself we are never clearly told which and who sets people at loggerheads by devices which seem rather palpable there is a great sense of localityof topography one might sayall through the story which gives it a peculiar charm and there are some really fine descriptions of scenery on the other hand the authors style is a very long way behind that of the old sagas which she has taken for her models we get in the end sadly bored by the constant apostrophes to the reader of which the following may be taken as a specimen   44 friends  children of men you who dance and you who laugh i pray that you dance carefully and laugh kindly for much sorrow may come to pass if your thinsoled silken shoe treads uxn a tender human heart instead of the hard floor plank and your gay silver ringing laugh may drive a soul to

most interesting figure in the belgian wing of the french army of literaturehas produced though still a young man m verhaeren may be said to be already in his third period his earliest work was of the senses he was preoccupied with the attempt to give an exact and sometimes even a brutal transcript of what he very literally saw and then he discovered an imagination and his visions began to take colour not so much from the things seen as from the personality of him who sawfrom the nerves mr symons would have it for he considers that the poetry of linnie verhaeren more than that of any other modern poet is made directly out of the complaining voices of the nerves but a further stage in the poets evolution was still to come without losing his unembarrassed view of material facts without losing his individual gift of various and coloured metaphor he has advanced to the possession of ideas les aubes is full of an idea works out indeed to quote mr symons once more a sort of deliverance through ideas it is largely planned as a criticism a prophecy even a menace to the modern civilizations on the one hand you see the festering cities and the farms ruined by progress and by narrow greed on the other not an impossible pastoral ideal built up again but the cities once more regenerated from within themselves herenien the man of ideas the man of books is leader of the revolt and the dawn is nigh at hand when the besiegers and the besieged of oppidomagne alike throw off the militarism of their worthless rulers and hail the new era of fraternity with garlands and iconoclasm mr symons has achieved his version with more selfsuppression than is common in translators he has made it his business to reproduce as far as possible the precise rhythm of m verhaerens vers libre only replacing with the authors approbation the rhyme of the original by blank verse and we think he has been unusually successful in catching some of the more characteristic qualities of his model the repetition playing with such wonderful effect on the nerves of the reader the almost ollendorffian simplicity of the main web of the dialogue lending itself to ollendorffian parody we mean but giving such value by contrast to the passages of vivid imagery to the occasional delicate symbolisms which it encloses here is a sample of the rendering chosen because of the rhythmic transitions over which it is victorious herenien in the midst of the beleaguered city addresses his wife   ab you indeed are mv wife when on a night in june loiik ago now sweetly you gave me your soul did 1 not swear that

be to whom 4les auhes can have a message who are not prepared to read it in the original we are glad to find that at last ostrovsky the russian dramatist has been introduced to the english public we say introduced advisedly for although a clever article upon his plays was published in the edinburgh review thirty years ago it remained unnoticed at that time russian authors were not in fashion and it is fashion that decides these things the present play presents a sad picture of domestic life in russia  but the tragedy might have been enacted in any other country a gentle impulsive girl is led astray through having a coarse unsympathetic husband and a harsh stepmother there is nothing especially tatar about this to use the cuckoo cry similar things have occurred and are occurring no doubt within the sound of bow bells the characters are powerfully drawn and the suicide of poor katia at the end of the play is deeply pathetic the peasant kuligin with his mechanical inventions is a genuine russian study the translation is accurate and very readable  we hope that this is only an instalment and that mrs garnett will follow it up by versions of some of the other plays of this

tudeer chapman  hall 6s this is a novel of a totally new kind saga is perhaps the best name for it although it is in some parts as emphatically not a saga as we understand the word as in others it is imagine a sentimentalist and heroworshipper brought up in a scandinavian wild rich in legend and stories of the great men and lovely women of a past generation and then imagine him many years after reconstructing the old society of which in his impressionable infancy and boyhood he had heard so much from nurses and elders then you have some notion of the book before us it is however more than that for not only is the author a sentimentalist and heroworshipper he is poet too and romanticist and he is filled with sympathy and compassion for the weak no less than with joy in revelry and courage so much for what he has what our author has not is sense of form and reticence he has given his saga with both hands flung incidents and reflections on the paper with the slightest thread to join them leapt recklessly now forward now backward into time explained some things forgotten others but the book lives none the less it is shapeless bewildering inconstant and all the time it is alive passionate vigorous picturesque and absolutely foreign to english methods of thought we return to the word saga with some relief that is certainly the best description gosta berling is a young priest who has been deprived of his sacred office oe account of his drunkenness he becomes a beggar the lowest of the low and is seeking death in a snowdrift when the majors wife of ekeby drags him forth and reasons him back to life thenceforward gosta berling is one of the ekeby cavaliers and for the rest of the book he is brilliant and handsome and masterful at once the strongest and weakest of men how he crosses the lives of others and through suffering finds himself and justifies the core of good that is in him that is the story but never was plot unfolded with more doublings and divergencies never was allegory if it is allegory so bravely tricked out in the garments of romance one passage can give no notion of so varied a book yet here is part of the conversation between the majors wife the most striking figure in the story and gosta berling but suddenly the majors wife was silentand took two or three turns about the room then she drew up a chair to the fire placed her feet on the hearth and rested her elbows on her knees  good god she said half laughing to herself  what i said was so true i didnt notice it myself dont you think gosta berling that most people in the world are dead or half dead  do you think we are all alive p ah no  look at me i am the lady of the manor at ekeby and the most powerful woman in varmland if i lift a finger the county police must

tell you boy i am nothing but a dressedup corpse god alane knows how little life there is in me  the beggar leaned forward in his ohair and listened anxiously the old lady rooked herself before the fire and never glanced at him as she spoke dont you think she continued that if i were a living soul and saw you sitting there miserable and sad with thoughts of suicide in your mind that i oould dispel them in a breath  i should have tears and prayers to move you and i would save youbut nowi am dead god knows how little life there is in me for the later life of the majors wife for the cavaliers who were of the tribe of the three musketeers and their escapades and for gosta berlings history the reader must go to this remarkable book himself he will find himself in a new world it is too long it is often tantalising and it is not too well translated but gusta berlings saga is very well worth reading  gosta berlings saga by selma lacinel translated bw lille tudeer 6s chapman and

sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his mistress the interview between the lovers is intended to be most pathetic the widow whose husband lies unburied assuring mr lansdell that he has no need to ask her forgiveness and mr lansdell commending the lady to the protection of his family mr lansdell dies penitent leaving the bulk of his vast property to isabel and his murderer escapes to america thus freed from her plebeian husband her aristocratic lover and her bloodstained father isabel takes possession of her landed estates becomes the intimate friend of lady gwendoline pomphrey and enters the ranks of the

matthew ferguson by margaret blake new york g w dillingham co 125 net a prevalent element in much of the american fiction that has lately come under our notice is good technique the writers are less dependent than many on the actual story and more able to carry off its deficiencies  matthew ferguson  is a case in point we cannot find great interest in the clever lawyer who makes for himself a career and crowns it by marrying the lady of his ideals  we cannot even find much probability but the story is sufficiently welltold though it is unduly elaborate at times pages upon pages are spent in bringing the hero to the point of seeing what he ought to do when courting his ladylove and these pages ive the impression of psychological pading  still in themselves they are good as to workmanship the fault of such elaboration is that it falsifies the characters they are drawn and drawn out to suit the work the style even the english butler is an example he is quite unconvincing as to reality and not sufficiently comic to be a pardonable figment the book is too lengthy and would have been greatly improved by compression and more decision in handling the personages,biography_contra

livingstones by derrick leon ios 6d hozarth press mr leon has a meticulous eye for detail and describes neatly and clearly many people of differing classes of society whom he has brought together in this novel their habitations either sordid or splendid are also painstakingly described but with such impartiality that the reader is apt to become interested in nothing told him even when the trade depression sweeps over the book and forces one character to drown himself our sorrow is not poignant if mr leon insists upon taking such realistic photographs he should choose a more promising subject than this present collection of essentially uninteresting people,biography_contra
  new novels a kingdom of dreams by j j bell i cassell  co an instant appeal to the curiosity is a sure method of attracting readers and mr bell makes it effectively in the prologue and first chapter of his new story his younger hero having been discharged from prison is suddenly and mysteriously befriended and becomes the guest of a charming gentleman and his niece the gentleman hopes to found a kingdom in africa where worldliness will have no place and money no value a huge sum of money is required to buy and stock land for this purpose and to obtain it he uses an ingenuity above petty scruples on this angelic and humorous rogue mr bell has expended much skill and the reader responds by developing a fondness for the character in question who however is allowed to lose his life in an illcontrived and melodramatic scene the element of love in the story is fresh and piquant but there is a coincidence favourable to the heroines opinion of her lover which is too improbable for acceptance,biography_contra
the shape of the world by evelyn st leger g p putnams sons 6s while there are many thoughtful passages in this book as a novel it is not a success the records of the javelin family show that for twelve generations each male representative of the race ended his life miserably we have an account of the lives of two of these men and also of their faithful and devoted wives the women are real their perseverance for and with their unhappy partners is commendable and natural but when we come to the two sir christopher javelins we are face to face with very extraordinary men indeed during part of their lives their actions read more like those of men possessed with an evil spirit or of ogres from fairy stories than of ordinary human beings after reading about the first sir christopher and how after a rather jolly but quite innocent supper party he changed from a genial thoughtful and sympathetic husband and neighbour into a morose and tyrannical beast we confess that before we are half way through with the delinquencies of sir christopher number two we are bored to death the author insists very strongly on the hereditary theory although the crazy spell under which the masters of the house of javelin are bound is admittedly broken by the arrival of a daughter and an accident which scatters or otherwise disarranges some of the superfluous brains of the young ladys father the story is rushed to its close the author apparently being as tired of the javelin family as is the reader evelyn st leger we think would be more successful as a writer of essays than a writer of fiction,biography_contra
the silver spoon by major arthur griffiths white 6s the subtitle of this book is  th adventures of a young gentleman in society the hero is first discovered entertaining a party of the demimonde in a monte carlo restaurant and it is for the most part in ouch society that the story moves until about halfway through the book when we find ourselves in an english rectory it is to be presumed that major griffithss readers are of those who seek rather for brisk adventure than for psychology in the construction of a story and who require of a denouement that its appeal shall be moral rather than esthetic this being on the whole a robust and wholesome point of view neither they nor the reviewer will complain of the swift conversion of the dissolute hero by the clergyman who had responded to his advertisement for a  tutor to give whole tine or of the coincidence by which the clergymans sisterinlaw proves to be none other than the girl who had put an end to the pigeon shooting at monte carlo in this generation it is perhaps only writers like major arthur griffiths who are to be credited with the courage in such matters of writers like charles dickens to a more critical eye the authors outandout blackcruards of which there are not a few will probably have more of the air of reality about them than the hero although considerably less engaging from the moral point of view but to those who seek in fiction the qualities that have long distinguished the author of  the rome express there will in any case be plenty of entertainment in  the silver spoon  the silver spoon by g h stevenson blackwood  sons the debilitating effect of being an heir presumptive upon a feeble and selfish nature is well illustrated by this novel which surprises the reader by abstaining from an ironic climax the principal characters are a medical student and his wife who marry on the strength of an allowance which is insufficient to meet their expenditure the first financial crisis reveals the parasitical disposition of the husband who while grudging the toil required for passing his final medical examination occasionally takes the risk of practising in manchester as if he were a qualified doctor and shows himself the worse for drink to a specialist who employs him as a collaborator his wife and their deformed child are pathetic figures  and a devoted servant provides good specimens of the unconscious humour of her class,biography_contra
the deemster  a romance by hall caine in 3 vols chatto this book would be welcome if only on the ground that it is well worthy of the author of the shadow of a crime in shifting his scene of action from the hills of cumberland to the isle of man mr hall caine has left behind him none of his three great gifts of imagination pathos and humour and he has found a people even more distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages to draw to himself in his fathers lifetime all his fathers property and turns his defrauded brother out of doors it is he who buys his wife of her father the archdeacon and breaks her heart with his infidelity in the first years of their married life it is he who cultivates the evil in his nephew dan and invents the lie which brings about the death of his own son ewan all through the book from the beginning to the welldeserved misery of his death he acts as a subtle malign influence poisoning the air little he gets by it except his barren position of power and the hatred of ail utterly without religion but superstitious to extreme his time is spent in doing illdeeds and striving to bribe providence to avert punishment one of the least adroit and most ridiculous of villains the evil he tries to do is always rebounding on his own head and the devil himself must have laughed when after haranguing the people and the bishop his brother as to the illdeeds of the bishops son and declaring that he will not lift a finger against the man who killed him he turns round to find that the corpse which was the subject of his oration was not that of his nephew but of his own son ewan the fact that the evil done by the deemster is not generally the exact injury contemplated by him but the casual action of a spirit of evil emanating from his infernal disposition is characteristic of the book it is not by themselves only and their passions that the fates of the principal characters are determined  and it is this which distinguishes the deemster rom what are usually called  romances the term serves to distinguish it from the novel or picture of modern life and manners but despite its narrativeform the spiritual grandeur of its conception and the tremendous character of the forces engaged raise it to the region of tragic drama among these forces the passions of though characters no doubt play the greatest part but above beyond and around these are the unseen if not supernatural powers of accident it is not without the aid of a network of circumstance woven by superstition and misconception and a thousand other impalpable devils that the noble natures of dan and ewan are brought into collision and dragged down to death and hell what mr hall caine calls the perfidy of circumstance is the great motor of the drama and dreams and presages second sight and curses superstitious terrors and evil thoughts all of them giving wings as it were to diverse spirits of evil which make a havoc of noble characters and lives of fair promise perform for him much the same office as the loves and hatreds of the gods with their emissaries of fates and furies dreams and omens for the poets and dramatists of greece it is this that raises the deemster into the rank of highest art and makes it not so much a romantic story of a few human individuals as a tragic poem of human life and fate yet the manner is that of a simple tale the characters are not complex they speak plain unconventional unpoetical english often the homespun of manx of analysis of character there is little the narrative if singularly vivid and abounding in remarkable incident is told without strain  fine  as the writing is in the best artistic sense there is not a word of what is usually called  fine writing to use an epithet once in favour with critics the method of presenting the facts to the reader is objective everything is described as if seen the characters are left mainly to reveal themselves by their deeds and the speech born of occasion the reader is a spectator not a confidant in describing the childhood of dan and ewan and mona the author employs anecdote mainly to distinguish character and even with regard to the deemster the most subtle of all the charactew we learn more by watching his deeds and listening to his words than by explanation of the author mr hall caine however mikes us know his men and women as well as if he told us all about them taeir presence their gestures the greater motives of their being are clear to us it is no minute and detailed portraiture but it is complete so far as is needed to distinguish one soul from another in force dan mylrea the bishops ungovernable son stands out clear from the resta being of intemperate will and passion beyond control but noble and honest withal capable of falling deeper and rising higher than ordinary mortals a scapegrace and prodigal on a grand scale gifted with the splendid health enormous strength and generous nature which made him a hero to his inferiors with the worst part of his nature j encouraged by his uncle the deemster and the best part of it but weakly attracted by the saintly example of his father the bishop he spends a youth of riot and instead of entering the church becomes the proprietor of a fishing smack after drinking away with his men the years earnings of the boat he pays his crew with a bill on which he forges the name of his cousin  the pazon as security ewan saves him from disgrace hy acknowledging the signature but his father casts him off and ewan while permittiog him to live in his house withdraws his friendship and forbids him from intercourse with his sister mona now the love between ewan and dan had surpassed the love of women and mona had been his dearest playfellow so was dan cut off from all the good influences of his life  they are taking the wrong way with me said dan dan does not improve he ruins his father by mismanaging his farm commits numerous excesses and the relations between himself and ewan become more and more strained one day a vile story is told to ewan by his father the deemster and maddened by the belief that dan has seduced mona he seeks him with a murderous heart pride and passion forbidding explanation they fight like devils and ewan reels and falls over the cliff far from this being the end of the story the events that follow are even more original striking and terrible and reveal more completely the genius of the author the truly tragic scene between dan and mons in which mona declares her love for the slayer of her brother the attempt of dan and his crew to bury the body at sea when it slips its weights and sails away to land the return of the boat the surrender of dan and his terrible expiation under the sentence of his father and the final scenes of the sweating sickness and the part dan played therein are all grandly conceived and grandly executed no doubt much fault might be found with the book while calling itself a romance it aims at such an appearance of literal truth that we cannot help asking ourselves if oil crist mylrea was really the bishop of mw at the beginning of last century and was brother to the deemster and our confidence in its realistic veracity on the one hand and our acceptance of the romantic illusion on the other are both weakened the book is too full of extraordinary incidents the curse of mrs kerruish is fulfilled so fully and literally the secondsight of kerry is so terribly accurate the story proceeds by such a constant succession of marvels that it is only the singular skill with which they are introduced and the convincing manner with which they are described that prevent faith from halting but after all these are small things compared with the undeniable grandeur and beauty of this work of art cosmo monkhouse,biography_contra

of ennui wearying of existence and panting for excitement in this state of feeling approaching to one of despair luckily a stranger of most mysterious bearing lands on the coast who by degrees makes his acquaintance and finally gives himi his confidence 1le proves to be the last of a crew of buccanelrs who had long plundered the mexican shores and in a soli tary isle off the coast along with other spoil equally precious had buried a mass of churchplate this valuable booty the old man proposes to the lieutenant to go in pursuit ofhe himself renouncing all claim and professing only now to be preparing for the grave the lieutenant of course accedes as much for the sake of the adventure as of the plunder and receiving the necessary information starts forthwith his adventures in securing the prize constitute the staple of the tale which is full of improbabilities and presents little inducement to the reader to try the next the next however is considerably betterthe incidents are more stirring and striking leaving the impression of actual reality though of a very singular cast the scene is placed in the heart of antigua remote from other plantations where the worst passions might be indulged unchecked by the awe of a neighbourbood but the third tale takes by far the strongest hold of the feelings a young man of good family who having wasted a very considerable pros perty of his own and much of his mothers is in a moment of perplexity precipitated into an act of forgery to relieve the parent he has so deeply injured isle is sentenced to botany bay whither he is conveyed

history of his slave and cared nothing his family consisted of a sister and a niece both of them comparatively civilized the young lady especially seemned in that lonely spot one of the loveliest of human beings by degrees the youth contrives to snake some of the acconm plishments of his superior condition known to the ladies and is beginning to excite at least something like sympathy when the jealousy and vengeance of afeinale convict whose overtures to closer acquaintance he had rejected infuses some suspicion into the farmer and he in the rage of the moment loads him with abuse and accompanies it with a blow this is not to be borne the young man flies from the house and takes refuge among the bushinen with whom a few weeks before he had had an accidental encounter in a few days the gang propose to levy contributions on the farmer the youth for the sake of the ladies warns the farmer of the approaching attack a kindness which lie repays by betraying him to his associates from the indignation of these desperadoes he narrowly escapes by darting into the woods and elulding pursuit in his forlorn condition he joins a small party of the natives and again from somte misunderstanding with them he with difficulty escapes being speared afterroaming for some time in the woods exposed to a variety of perils he is suddenly arrested by a party of soldiers in search of an outlaw and by them conducted to sydney where he finds his mother who had procured his enancipation with her he continues for soeic time at sydney and is by the liberal party admitted into society here he encounters agrain his old masters niece whose affections he speedily wins and is finally prevailed upon to visit the uncle and endeavour to propitiate him the attempt is attended with fatal consequences he proved inflexible and was that very night inurdered by a bushmana fact which threw suspicion upon his visiter though not convicted of the crime in the course of the trial his flight from his master and intercourse with the bushmen became known and he was in consequence doomed to the public works at paraimatta reduced to a more deplorable condition than ever he joined a party in an attempt to seize a sloop and escape they were pursued and in the conflict the miserable youth was shot the tatle is entitled the false step and the p urpose of the writer is to trace its

the eustace diamonds the eustace diamonds by anthony trollope in three voomes chapman aod hall mr trollope has a place of his own and a very worthy place among novelists and moralists  and  the eustace diamonds  shows him at his best both as a moralist and asa novelist nearly all his men and women are wonderfully lifelike their characters and the incidents through which thosecharacters exhibit themselves are admirably portrayed and an excellent vein of satire genial yet searching in its way is shown in all his work the good sense that he always displays carries a moral that goes far beyond the ground to which his stories are apparently confined and perhaps without intending it certainly without weakening his books as mere works of fiction he uses them to preach very useful sermons on some of the follies and vices of the day in this respect 4the eustace diamonds is particularly noteworthy we do not know whether we have a right ta claim mr trollope as in aay way a supporter of the movement for improving the condition af women but if he is an unintentional ally his service is all the more valuable aad he could not possibly render better service than by his drawing of such characters as those el his two unheroic heroines in this novel lissie eustace and lucy morris lizzie shows cleverness that with scope given for its honest exercise would have made her as useful as she is clever but being poor aad having no other trade than marriage open to her she becomes only a becky sharp squanders all her wits and leads a very foolish and mischievous life lucy is as sweet and simple as a daisy but daisylike she runs a chance of being trampled down altogether and all because conventional restraints have made her unfit to hold her own against the stronger will and more selfish fancy of her lover frank greystock frank greystock the yet more unheroic hero is as useful as are the two young ladies in showing what poor sorts of persons are i produced by the orthodox arrangements of society and the unfortunate inequality of the sexes that now prevails and is as injurious to men as it is to women but the novel also points to other and kindred morals i within the figure and frame and clothes and cuticle within the bones and flesh of many of us there is but one persona man or woman with a preponderance either of good or evil whose conduct in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman such persons are simple single and perhaps generally safe they walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles and are today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow as they are today lady eustace was such a person and so was lucy morris opposite in their characters as two poles they were each of them a simple entity  and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman but there are human beingswho though of necessity single in body are dual in character in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good but to whom evil is sometimes horribly hideously evil but is sometimes also not hideous at all of such men it may be said that satan obtains an intermittent grasp from which when it is released the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble such menor women may hardly perhaps debase themselves with the more vulgar vices they will not be rogues or thieves or drunkardsor perhaps liars but ambition luxury selfindulgence pride and covetousness will get a hold of them and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices such a man waa freak greystock who could walk along the banks of the quiet troutgiving bob at bobsboroogb whipping the river with his rod telling himself that the world lost for tove would be a had thing well lost for a fine purpose  and who could also stand with his hands in his trousers pockets looking down upon the pavement in the purlieus of the courts of westminster and swear to himself that he would win the game let the cost to his heart be what it might what must a man be who would allow some undefined feeling some inward ache which he ealls a passion aad cannot analyse some desire which has come of instinct aad not of judgmentto interfere with all the projects of his intellect with all the work which he has laid out for his accomplishment circumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which indeed his meanswere insufficient but which he regarded as of all paths the noblest and the manliest if he could be true to himselfwith such truth as at these moments would seem to him to bethe truest truththere was nothing in rank nothing in ambition which might not be within his reach he might live with the highest the besteducated and the most beautiful he might assist ia directing national councils by his intelligence and might make a name for himself which should be remembered in his country and of which men would read the records in the histories written in after ages but to do this he must walk warily he an embarrassed man a man already in debt a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion was called upon to live and to live as though at his ease among those who had been bora te wealth and indeed he had so cleverly learned the ways of the wealthy that he hardly knew any longer how to live at his ease among the poor but had he walked warily when he went down to richmond and afterwards sitting alone in the obscurity of his chamber wrote the letter which bad made lucy morris so happy  the loves and pains the joys and struggles of these three persons form the basis of the plot of mr trollope  novel a diamond necklace furnishing the very ingenious thread on which it is strung in the prelude we learn that lizzie a poor orphan with good looks and spoilt talentt for her only fortune had succeeded in marrying lord eustace a rich and sickly youth and in causing him to die of a broken heart before a year was out when the detailed story begins she is trying to catch another husband by help of the fortune that she now possesses aa estate in scotland worth 4000 a year for life besides this however sha claims as her own property some splendid diamonds worth 10000 which the family solicitor regards as an heirloom that ought to ba given up for the benefit of her infant son when he suooeeds to the estate aad out of her greedy holding of these diamonds until they are stolen from her grow nearly all her troubles they cause her match with lord fawn to be broken off and bringing her into close intimacy with her cousin frank make her very anxious to form a match with him frank nearly yields to her fascinations and to the charm of her fortune and is accordingly very neglectful during more than two volumes of lucy morris the governess whom he really loves though he shrinks from marrying any one who has not some of the money that he sorely needs to help him on in his scheme of ambition nothing could be much better in its way than mr trollopes working out of frank greybtocks character shown in his flirtations with lizzie eustace in his honest lovemaking with lucy and in all his other actions throughout the book like persons goodhearted and even generous yet vacillating and in the main very selfish mr trollope has already described in great numbers but he always excels in this kind of portraiture and frank grey stock is equal to the best of his sort of course frank has enough distinguishing characteristics to justify his appearance in  the eustace diamonds and as long as such persons exist in real life and when will they cease to exist they can hardly be laughed at too often especially with such kindly laughter as slr trollope knows exactly how to arouse many of the minor persons in  the eustace diamonds are as carefully drawn as the principals especially lord fawn the dilletante undersecretary of state who regrets his engagement with lizzie very soon after it has been made yet is at his wits end to find some means of breaking it off without scandal and mrs carbuncle a very lively representative of the adventurous ladies who  get on in society until they are found out but why should we say much about a novel that so many people have probably by this time read   the fitful fever of a life by sir f vincent 3 vols newby  fever is an inappropriate title for sir francis vincents novel he has collected an immense number of people of a marriageable age and given them for the most part nothing to do but dancing croquet riding and similar amusements with the addition of cigarsmoking for the male portion of his puppetshow of course they drift into love and matrimony with various success caroline curtis the leading lady having somewhat more character than her companions is rather wicked and very foolish the others being only rather foolish and

young gentleman of eminent probity who shows no sort of objection or suspicion with regard to his companions character or the places and people he makes acquaintance with under his auspices repays his pupils kindness on his return to england by eloping with caroline when she is on the eve of marriage with his friend of course the erring couple are duly punished hargrave dying a felons death in prison and caroline after various hardships making an eminently satisfactory and saintly end the other pairs are more conventional and more happy in their loves for some time an obstacle in the shape of poverty hinders the felicity of mary bradford and the partner of her choice but that difficulty being surmounted by the bold expedient of a fortune being left to mr eden they attain the same successful consummation of their hopes as the halfdozen other couples who drag through three volumes the even tenor of their way with the exception of too copious a use of scraps of french and some eccentricities on the part of the printer there is positively nothing to object to in the  fitful fever of a life it is not at all feverish and perhaps a trifle hard to read but this last point may be useful as a mental discipline for those who have ample leisure to employ on novel reading,biography_contra

the tragedy of the korosho by a conan doyle smith elder  co when thirteen tourists of mixed nationality find themselves grouped together on a nile steamer above the first cataract it is inevitable that disaster should happen in mr conan doyles story the circumstances admit of a raid by dervishes when a portion of the unlucky company is engaged in inspecting ruins bloodshed ensues while the captives are being hurried away across the desert and more bloodshed occurs when the arabs are caught between two detachments of the camel corps and the surviving europeans are rescued it is a bold writer who ventures to construct a story out of these materials which in less skilful hands would hardly suffice for a magazine article however we now have it in a book which with digressions it just suffices to fill such a digression occurs at a point when the i story looks as if it were coming to a premature conclusion one of the captive tourists is thus described  44 the kind grey eyes and calm sweet face of the irishwoman brought comfort and hope to the whole party she was a devout roman catholic and it is a creed which forms an excellent prop in hours of danger to her to the anglican colonel to though nonconformist minister to the presbyterian american even to the two pagan black riflemen religion in its various forms was fulfilling the same beneficent officewhispering always that the worst which the world can do is a small thing and that however harsh the ways of providence may seem  and so on fortunately mr conan doyles digressions do not last long and are sometimes better than this but they are characteristic of the modern popular novelist and it is difficult to imagine that they constitute a strain on the author the local colour is good  there is a distinct effort to preserve the individualities and the broad national characteristics of the different tourists who are temporarily placed at the mercy of the arab chiefs but the story is thin and will not suffice to place  the tragedy of the korosko on a level with  rodney stone we can imagine that it is of interest to compare the relative actions and words of a solder a lawyer a french gentleman an american traveller and others when all are placed in equal doubt and danger and when there is little chance that the cleverest will do any better than the least capable it is not easy to think that mr conan doyle has made the most of the opportunity it is right to add that the book is very copiously illustrated and that the illustrations are sometimes very successful,biography_contra

of whllat he does and has set himself at llawtlhoriis feet with the entire trust and adniiriation which we may suppose to have been exhibited formerly by the pupils in the school of a great and original painter he has his reward too for he has caught much more than the mere trick of style by no means difficult to imitate and has succeeded more nearly than any other writer we have met in entering into hawthornes psychology with its half morbid and entirely weird conception of life we incline to think  the madonna of the future  the most artistic of his tales though that which gives the title to his book is most fully worked out and is very subtle in treatment recalling here andi there the  septimius  of his model there is one blot in the book the material ghastli ness of the endingof one story the romance of certain old clothes which is more like poe than hawthorne and which we think the author will feel on reflection would have gained in impressiveness by the omission of the last detail and the substitution of a mere look of frozen terror on the dead face the incident as it stands mars the whole conception of perdita with which it is entirely out of keeping eglantine makes no advance but rather retrogression in its authors literary work for it is by no means so good a novel as any of its three precursors there are tokens throughout of too much facility in mere production of copy and too little pains in reducing that copy to symmetrical form to say nothing whatever of artistic conscientiousness in detail which is not atoned for by the occasional introduction of clever sentences and paragraphs the story if it may be so called is an autobiographical mono logue with but little interest since the only attempts at special delineation of character depict types which are tediously common in the modern novel such as the gracious and insincere matron of society and the mature young lady who affects gushing childishness and in these days of realistic painting it is not too much to ask even a lady author to be correct in details meant to give local colour and finish the daughter of a great scientific philosopher of wide general learning as the narrator of the story is supposed to be would not again and again cite the differential calculus  as the tremendously abstruse subject which her fathers distinguished visitors habitually discussed with him they would be just as likely to discuss the rule of three nor would she include gibbons english history as forming along with the decline and fall part of the favourite reading of her model coastguardsman at least it was inconsiderate if such were the case not to make the learned mr leslie seize on the book hitherto unknown to bibliography and give it to the reading public which would only too gladly welcome such a discovery it may be carpingly minute criticism to say that the st bees hood which the model broad church parson of the book wears and of which the author who attempts dutch painting makes a good deal is not purple but a wonderful combination of red and white but that a writer wlio has evidently a turn for marketing and cookery with a hearty relish for her victuals should give as a proof of the utter imbecility of her gushing lady that young persons belief that eggs arc or ought to be sold by the pound strikes us as showing very little grasp of the economical bearings of the subject would it surprise her to hear that more than one american legislature has recently enacted that all eggs are henceforth to be sold by the pound and that the average dozen must turn a given weight on the ground that the present system of selling by mere number irrespective of size is unfair to the purchaser and a permanent discouragement to careful breeding since no advantage is now gained in the market by the farmer who brings the finest and heaviest eggs for sale over his competitor who looks to quantity alone several other questions social and religious are settled in the book just as decisively and with exactly the same amount of intelligent understanding as this one and we would cheerfully give all the judgments and the longwinded reasons for their formation in exchange for a little more life and movement in the somewhat wooden puppets of the tale  jocelyns mista7ke derives its interest almost wholly from its central figure which is a very good study of character mrs spender has not sought to devise novel situations for her plot and has contented herself with using materials which have served many authors before but she has employed them better than usual the main situation in the book for example is not very different from that in a once popular story e laiu wyndham yet there is no likeness at all in treatment so that the sense of triteness does not strike the reader mrs spenders english is unusually good and she has learned the art of working her opinions on men and things into the web of her story in stead of merely intercalating homilies after the fashion of too many of her sisters with the certainty of having them skipped by the judicious reader who desires in the emphatic language of a schoolboy uttered in the present critics hearing more story and less jaw the jocelyn of the book is very skilfully drawn an impetuous wilful passionate imaginative woman in whom the perceptive faculties are far more matured than the reflective who feels but does not reason and who is from temperament what frenchmen call tate montee and americans high falutinc in season and out of season the chief success of the book is the manner in which the author conciliates the sympathies of her readers in favour of the very defective heroine and makes them understand how she could win and retain the affections of two men of exceptional mark and power though of different types and that without her having brain enough with all her imagination and fluency to appreciate the best qualities of either one particularly happy touch quite true to nature is that where jocelyn spoils her application for the post of governess by springing on her hobby at a chance word of her proposed employer and delivering a lecture then and there on the development of woman mfore we think might have been made of the contrast between the fiery and courageous heroine and her vacillating brother but where it is brought out at all it is well done finally the toile of the book is entirely high and sound and though it does not belong to the small first rank of novels that will live it rises in type and diction far above the ephemeral stories of the season olt of society is a commonplace and rather dull book written in a style which is alternately fine and slipshod gorgeous in adjectives and hazy in grammar it belongs to the school of transpontine melodrama according to which hardness selfishness and vice are habitual characteristics of those who move or try to move in refined and wealthy circles while generosity and virtue must be souglht among those who are out of society that a life of much ease and little responsibility is unfiavourable to loftiness of aim and energy of action is doubtless true enough but mrs pulleyne must know very little indeed of modern engrland if she imagines that the line can be drawn as she draws it the artisans who refuse to associate with labourers or even to use the same houses of call the shopboys who rob tills to pay gambling debts the working men who correct their wives with iron clogs are on the whole not more admirable citizens than mrs pulleynes aristocrats and are real flesh and blood while her characters despite of the dedication of her book to a lady of princely rank are clearly evolved from a not very vivid imagination and do not by any means convey the impression of being studies from life and personal contact especially as she has not mastered the somewhat intricate system of english titles of rank robert forrcster is the work of a very inexperienced hand and the best counsel for the author is to attempt a play and to put the manuscript into the hands of some practised manager or actor in order to see how much and what would be cut out curiously enough there is a chapter in the book wherein the heroine by her frank criticisms induces a lady friend to give up novelwriting as not possessing the necessary faculty and being unable to see what is expedient in a book meant to win public approval the actual story in robert forester scarcely occupies onefifth of the volume and the remainder is entirely taken up with digressions sometimes on scenery and more often on what the characters could should might ought or would have thought or done while their actual doings are compressible into a very small bulk indeed thus in one chapter of the book two persons engaged to two other persons meet for an avowal of their preference for one another and nearly twelve pages are given to a chapter which immediately follows this whose whole contents consist of the fact that their conversation was overheard by one of the other pair and that she did not like it ten words in the chapter whiich describes the meeting would have been enough and this is just the place where an experienced manager would have ruthlessly cut down the copy were it a play nor are the descriptions of scenery vivid enough to be worth the space they occupy we have three living novelists who can write of scenery so as to delight their readers air black perhaps first mir blackmore a good second and amr george macdonald third though if his admirable poetical vignettes of landscape be taken into account he might be assigned the highest place it aliss thompson will read any of these writers and endeavour to analyse their method in comparison with her own she will probably see the cause of her failure her converse tions too are often wordy and uncolloquial runninig sometimes into monologue so that comfpr essionl is the chief literarvactluiremnt for viuich she must strive if she is to win a

of messrs sampson low will bo welcomed by a largo and sympathetic public dr holmes is a causeur who has sat out more than ono generation and we of today havo by no means tired of his chat an urbane goodtempered old gentleman ho has always been with all the pleasant qualities of interesting elderly poople who talk  avriting or printing ho tells us in though  autocrat is like shooting with a rifle you may hit your readers mind or miss itbut talking is like playing at a mark with the pipe of an engine  if it is within reach and you have time enough you cant help hitting it dr holmes has talked in print for more than thirty years he has aimed at a mark which has been quito within reach and having had plenty of timo ho has certainly hit it though now edition divides itself into four sections first come  though autocrat of though breakfast  table tho professor at though breakfasttable tho poet at the breakfasttable and what wo may call the fourth number of though series  over though teacups then follow the novels  elsie aenner the guardian angel and  a mortal antipathy after these como three volumes of essays and jottings  pages from an old aolumo of life  medical essays and  our hundred days in europe though remaining three volumes contain dr holmess poems out of the thirteen volumes there are not a few which may without much loss bo disregarded dr holmess verso is sometimes very graceful and can be enjoyed as the lightest of light comedy but it is not easy to take him quito seriously in the character of a poet though  professor contains one really exquisite littlo poem  under the violets  her hands are cold lier face is white  no more her pulses come and go  her eyes are shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but in spite of such popular clever and ingenious pieces as  the chambered nautilus  and the last leaf it remains the one serious poem by dr holmes which can be admired without reservation poetically inclined dr holmes has always been and by no means without a certain accomplishment of verso but with him metrical writing has been a sort of accident it is significant that in one of his latest books we find hun saying  i find the burden and restrictions of rhyme more and more troublesome as i grow older there are times when it seems natural enough to employ that form of expression but it is only occasionally  and the use of it as the vehicle of the commonplace is so prevalent that one is not much tempted to select it as the medium for his thoughts and emotions that with all its truth could hardly have been written by a poet as a diarist  our hundred days in europe and an essayist on medical and semiscientific topics  medical essays and pages from an old arolume of life dr holmes is very much himself and he is often most entertaining in his customary instructed way never was europe seen through such rosecoloured glasses never was so amiable a record of foreign travel as these  hundred days it is the most gossiping of all dr holmess gossiping books its egotism is of its essence and it is decidedly pleasant to see how pleased one can be with london the essays have several points of interest and might almost bo called a new search into  vulgar errors  and the caprices of the learned even the medical essays aro quite within the scope of the ordinary reader and some of the papers such as that on  automatism and crime are curiously up to date in both subject and treatment of the three novels if we may call them so which dr holmes has published one  elsie aenner has enjoyed a popular success and has been accepted by though novelreader as a story all three are founded on certain strange and doubtful scientific doctrines or assumptions and all three suffer to a certain extent from the fact that they were written partly as a medium for scientific experiment certain terrible mysteries of hereditythe poisoning of though sources of life  have afforded subjects which merely as subjects for fiction aro of the keenest interest but a novel with a purpose was never written without some entanglement of purpose and story and curious fascinating attractively repellent as these books certainly are one reads them with a constant sense of though two opposite motives the artistic and the scientific which united in shaping them even  elsie aenner the first and the best of the tliree is injured as a work of art by a frequent insistence on facts as facts the curiosity of though physician in diseases not of the artist in situations amateur pathology in fiction is so common nowadays that it is certainly interesting to have for once ones pathology from a novelist who is also a doctor but the doctor with all his artistic skill with all his wish to present his problem artistically can never forget that he has before him an interesting  case  elsie arenner as it is is a fascinating story but imagine what  elsie arenner might have been had it been written with the personal suppression the suppression of oneself in ones documents that marks the really great artist in the supernatural in a word contrast  elsie venner with  sidonia though sorceress but it is not by his poems his essays or even his novels that dr holmes is best known and best liked in tho autocrat of the breakfasttable he has written what is probably the most popular modern book of conversational prosea commonplace  book after though older and more leisurely manner recalling indeed many models but with a personal difference which has been quite in favour of popularity each succeeding volume of the series has been received with a somewhat fainter welcome yet always with a welcome and indeed it would bo difficult to resist so oenial so insinuative so communicative a guide philosopher and friend who seems to nudge ones elbow with a  by the way  as he gives a quaint unexpected comment on the matter you are thinking about pr holmes is quite the typical dilettante scientist inexhaustibly curious about everything always stimulative in his queries always suggestive in his hints he knows much has collected the curiosities of knowledge and has arranged them in an intentionally and attractively casual way after long consideration and with the advantage of a point of view which is not that of all the world and it is of the curiosities of the soul that ho is most curious it is to the shyer sensations and emotions that ho is most anxious to give form in these essays in asides as they might be called aaith certain tricks learned from sterne and others from sterne more than any otherho has developed an ingenious and subtle use of though bracket  i want my  asides you see he remarks in though  autocrat to whisper loud to you who read my notes and sometimes i talk a page or two to you without pretending that i said a word of it to our boarders you will rind a very long  aside  to you almost as soon as you begin to read and so dear young friend

waters of some quiet river where as my friend the professor says you can sit with natures wrist in your hand and count her ocean pulses his is the art of suggestion and his special kind of humour is a roundabout allusive variety a delicate intellectual humour which has nothing in common with that vivid and explosive vulgarity which is though typical american product sometimes trivial and a little

the deluge an historical novel of poland sweden and russia by henryk sienkiewicz translated from the polish by jeremiah curtin 2 vols dont  co weare glad of the attempts which are now being made to familiarise the english public with the writings of henryk sienkiewicz the most eminent of living polish novelists some time ago the first romance of his great historical trilogy 4 fire and sword  was reviewed in the columns of this journal 4 the deluge  forms the second and we hope messrs dent will give us the third 4 pan michael sienkiewicz appears to have led a wandering life and was for some years in america but resides we believe at present in warsaw like count tolstoi he loves to put a great many figures on his canvas which is crowded with pictures of battle and adventure he contrives also to introduce the leading historical personages of the period and following the example of the late anthony trollope carries some of his imaginary characters through a whole series of novels thus in 4the deluge we have the reappearance of pan zagloba a thoroughly falstaflian individual whose adventures are legion and his bombast and selflaudation inexhaustible the history of poland is so little studied in this country that the facts upon which the novel is based will be familiar to few we must therefore go a little into detail the period of 4 the deluge  is that of the reign of john casimir in which poland suffered from all the ills of foreign and civil war an amiable but weak man he ascended the throne in 1649 and married his brothers widow marie louise a woman of beauty and spirit in his reign the swedes invaded the country and took both cracow and warsaw and he was obliged to fly into silesia their success would not have been so great had not the entranceinto the country been made easy by the treachery of opalinski the palatine of posen and radziwill the hetman of lithuania karl gustav the swedish king meditated parcelling out the country giving portions to the elector of brandenburg the hetman and others but the swedes were driven out polands hour had not yet come in 1668 john casimir abdicated all these characters figure in the picturesque pages of m sienkiewicz opalinski who wrote some venomous satires on the universal corruption of mankind is brought before us with all his odious characteristics radziwill appears as the evil spirit of the story and dies in great suffering he is portrayed as a gloomy ambitious man and is made additionally odious on account of his calvinism which stands in strong relief to the fanatical roman catholicism of his countrymen the hero is a gallant young polish noble who is desperately in love with a charming girl panna alexandra or in its pretty abridged form olenka he is induced at first to take the side of radziwill but when ho discovers that he is a traitor he deserts the cause of the powerful hetman it is this change of front that gets him into trouble after hairbreadth escapes he contrives to make his way to the king in silesia his devotion to the cause of john casimir is profound he distinguishes himself in many engagements and finally receives the hand of the young lady of whom he is enamoured olenka meanwhile has not been without her perils but we will not forestall their interest there is no lack of vigour in the authors style but the bloodshed may pall upon the gentle reader in the words of byrons criticism on dr polidoris tragedy all stab and everybody dies these nobles as represented by m sienkiewicz are certainly brutal enough in spite of their occasional airs of chivalry as for the wretched peasantry they seem only to exist to be pillaged turned into soldiers and killed by the rival factions we have old poland before us in the pages of our novelist and a sad country it is at best m sienkiewicz puts additional colour into his picture by his accounts of the swedes and their armies many scotchmen also figure here we almost wonder that he did not include the renowned patrick gordon afterwards the friend of peter the great this fine specimen of the scotch younger son and mercenary soldier of the period has told us in his diary how being frequently taken prisoner he passed from one party to the other now fighting with the swedes and now with the poles it only remains in conclusion to say some words on mr curtins translation he has long since won his spurs as a worker in slavonic fields he is accurate almost to baldness and we think that on many occasions he might have given a footnote for we cannot imagine what the english reader will think of some of the expressions left unexplained eg the snitch to adopt the translators spelling so also to interpret the polish for constantinople as the city of the tsar cargrad is rather confusing it would have been better to say the city of the caesars the many americanisms are of course in the natural order of things whatever our translator gains in accuracy by his phonetic spelling of polish names he seems to lose in the hideous form which he communicates to all the native words we do not think our polish friends can possibly be pleased with these transformations he might by the way have given tylsa its

the sinter ofcharity or from bermondsey to bel ffrarui by mrs challice 2 vols bentleythere is a good deal of talent in the sister of charity but j it is so overlaid with affectation and sentimentality  that few readers will we fear have the patience to read to the end or at least they will nkip all the fine  writing and confused dissertations on social evils and social reformation the sister of charity is j a vory ambitious book and deals with all the social  and political questions now going on in a style of frank compendious rashness and a sublime ignorance of the hindrances and friction which ways ami means bring with them in the actual world the authoress has evidently listened to good conversation on most of the social topics of the day  and in the novel before us she has endeavoured to dramatise what she has heard and to reutter what she has learnt but she has not jwrfectly grasjied the ideas nor has she thought them out for herself consequently her oracle is a graceful murmuring babble in which it is difficult to detect any specific meaning beyond a general tendency of good intention vagueness and diffuseness are the chief sins in the book the authoress can write something mach better if she will only condescend to the virtue that lie in  plainness of speech beatrice lester the heroine is miss florence nightingale with variations  and after heroisms and selfsacrifices innumerable she finils at last love marriage bridesmaids and belgravia all lying in her path of duty a a matter of taste we rather object to patting out virtue at compound interest material rewards of vulgar happiness are out of keeping with the very high and sublime pitch of virtue to wkrkh beatrice hail attained  and the conclusion inevitable with all readers of the sister of

capital must be relresented in the senate administrative reforin must be thoroughly worked out by the unselfish earnestness of true individuality and this  thorough regeneration must be assisted by the women such is the creed sought to be illustrated and enforced ir the sister f charity we will say nothing to damp the ardour of the authoress we  were once quite as enthusiastic and as trusting as i mrs clhallice  but the experience of nigh fifty years has wrought its usual disenchantnients by i teaching us that the world is infinitely less honest and vastly more kindhearted than in our young days it appeared to us and it is pleasant to greet now and then a mind that still is what ours i was  for certain it is that time will too soon l substitute the sad and sober truth for the glad and gorgeous vision what inen and women ouylit to be rather than what they are will be i seen in these pages which have the attractions i of some excellent writing unexceptionable son 1 timents and an admirable purposequalities i which will go far to excuse the absence of two other desirable features in a novel a good plot and originality of character both of which are wanting here mirs challice has however made a promising beginning and a little more practice of her art and further experience of life will doubtless supply defects which are the comwon failings of young authors ood in everiything is designed to teach the moral that none of us know what is best for ourselves that the darkest hour of the night precedes the dawn that seeming misfortunes often prove to be blessings it is an old truth preached by philosophers in all ages and it forms one of the most useful articles of the christian creed but it is not always received as trustingly in practice as in precept it is very hard to reconcile ourselves to a positive present pain or inconvenience in prospect of some future benefit the strongestminded of us men or women cannot but turn longing lingering looks backwarl upon disappointed hopes fiction might fairly be called to the aid of philosophy in such a cause a story evolved before our eyes much assists the argument it is that teaching by example which is always so much more effective than precept mrs foot has set before herself a useful and not a difficult task she has plunged her heroine into misery that she might prove how a kind providence will show a way of escape to those who put faith in gods love the story is shortbelow the conventional standard of novels but in these two volumes mirs foot has condensed as much incident as is usually expanded over three the plot is original ingenious complicated and very interesting some of the scenes as the deathbed marriage at the opening of the second volume are described with unusual power the character of mrs truman is well sustained altogether it is above the average of fictions and we hope soon to give the authoress another welcome mr platts smothers and sons has this faultthe author seems to think that to be natural lie must set down in his dialogues all that in real life persons say to one another however worthless unmeaning or disconnected with the story this is a mistake not peculiar to mr platt a dialogue in a fiction should not be like a pennyaliners report where every word and incident are transcribed for the purpose of spreading the story over as many lines as possible for instance the following is not artistic however iprecise a copy of a talk between a father and his child s 0 merev there again what was that  exclaimed esther  that was more than a common thinderclap 0 my head

know thatof a brighter day tomorrow i any number of volumes might be filled with such dialogues as this but the object of dialogue in a novel is either to advance the story or to develop character whatever does not one of ithese things is simply impertinence and waste of ipaper and a trial of the readers temper mir platt has we fear been trying to imitate mir read in his recklessness of phrases and audacity of description but lie wants mir readcs powerful conceptions which alone can justify such rude ilancvuage as is usual with inferior writers lie iimitates the mannerism and thinks ie is copyingi ithe maln there is no greater mistake genius is inimitable and a sensible writer will always try to say somethingnew or if he cannot do that i to say old things in some new way instead of trying to write like somebody else who has made a reputation it is not only in authorship that this i absurdity of imitation prevails it pervades i society let a man strike out a new path in any direction and succeed and instantly a multitude of others endeavour to follow in the same path instead of seeking a new one for themselves and they fail because the ground is preoccupied mr platt has a wealth of words if he would only use them judiciously and he has a fertile fancy if he would but trust to its own flights instead of striving to follow after those who have already soared if m11others and sons were to be weeded as it should have been of all superfluous dialogues descriptions and words it would be reduced to one half its present bulk but it would be twice as readable as it is its faults outnumber its merits although these are not few but there are sins against good taste and good breeding which cannot be so readily forgiven there was no need to repeat in the dialogues

attempt to force three volumes on the public every year that he will soon be without readers except such as contract with a circulating library and make a point of gulping every thing published under the name of a novel or a romance it is now some fifteen months since mr boggy published his  three perils of man a work with which we were at some pains to make our readers acquainted we did justice

w1 e confess we have read the three perils of woman and indeed mr hogfgs former romance to some disadvantage on account of our imperfect knowledge of the barbarous jarcron he so copiously introduces in the novel before us he has puzzled us sadly and never was our jamieson so thumbed or our glossaries so frequently consulted to enable us to translate the  three perils of woman for our own right understanding and gratification and not for that of our family to whom we soon found we must make it a sealed book we have heard it remarked that our english readers affect to admire the wxaverly

with appeals to the deity and the services of the church mr flioog thought he must be in fashion and how he has succeeded we shall show presently we recollect reading in some work the author of which

three perils of wonman had been published by carlile or benbow they would have run a fourth perilthat of a prosecution by the attorneygeneral but much as we censure mlr hogg for his irreverence we

tryphena in love surely dialect in fiction like onion in a salad is best when it lurks halfsuspected yet animates the whole not when it intrudes its plebeian presence to the destruction of more subtle flavours nor unless we chance to be philologists are we chiefly concerned that it be pedantically exact indeed the truer impression is more often given by a somewhat conventional vocabulary such as mr chevalier permitted his costers to employ than by a phonographically accurate record mr raymond never a noticeable offender in this way has in this book been still more reticent in obtruding nonfamiliar idioms his dialect subtly pervades the whole storyin the impersonal passages as well as those uttered directly by the chief actors yet you are never driven to a glossary nor forced to read phonetic passages aloud to gather their meaning from their sound this seems a very artistic use of dialect for fiction is not merely a mosaic of local phrases and idioms and the art that plucks these wild flowers of speech and sets them before the painters figures and background is nearer akin to the craft of the panorama maker who fills his realistic foreground with dyed ferns and dead branches than to that of the painter who translates all essential details to be represented harmoniously in the one medium at his command this course seems more than ever admirable when home rule for novelists is a popular cry and the novel of locality finds a warm welcome it is encouraging to see that the wide district of somerset has been appropriated by so good a storyteller as mr raymond who loyal as he is to his chosen county never forgets that he appeals to a cosmopolitan audience and gives enough local colour and no more by this he makes the reader feel for the time a genuine resident in the district he has selected neither a cockney tourist bent on manufacturing stage pastorals from prosaic peasants nor a scientific visitor keen to discover how much of the kelt or saxon survives in the yeomen and yokels his is the best wayyou open  tryphena and forget everything except a vague sense of halfforgotten country scents blowing round youand the vivid planes of sunshine and shade so unlike the lowtoned harmony that faces you in town from the first word of the prologue to the last of the epilogue far too briefly traversed you are the unseen spectator of an idyll that is carefully selected from real life it is indeed a piece of genre painting of the highest order a pastoral comedy where tragedy pathos humour and above all love sway the actors in most human fashion yet as you read you forget to analyse and enjoy the artlessness of the telling unhindered by any critical purpose so mr raymond witches you and reveals the true secret of the raconteur that of hypnotising his audience to perfect sympathy the story itself might be told in a sentence it has but four characters mrs joshua pettigrewneither mrs poyser nor an aunt of maggie tulliver nor a relative of bathsheba everdene or any wessex housewifethe least important yet one who lives and moves a genuine creation her somewhile crippled son prisoner in the chamber where the king hid tryphena the almost innocent cause of the accident which has made him helpless straight and bright as the poppy docks she sometimes brought in from the hillside  and miss mervin the new comer at the hall who as fairy princess wakens the prince to loveanother they are all as real as life and as devoid of the unexpected as the multiplication table itself but instead of fading into forgetfulness after the fashion of the complex personalities of the problem novel they are as actual as the villagers you met during your last holiday in the country if the novel of locality bring us books of this order books   tryphena in love by walter raymond the iris library zs 6d net london j m pent and co we may place near cranfurd with no sense ot unworthiness then indeed might the novel of locality accomplish much but on rereading you discover it is the art of the story that really satisfied you its mere form is a thing worth analysing t prologue repeated with slightly changed modulation for the epilogue is in as classic a form as bachs famous chaconne where the great sequence of chords repeated with a final major close gives at once the text and the peroration of the work this difficult form mr raymond wields as lightly as mr bret harte used his chorus of children in cressy a chance reader would not suspect the arbitrary plan underneath the fantasy so the dramatic unity is accomplished with perfect symmetry and yet retains all the vitality and freshness of an improvisation mr walter raymonds  mistertons mistake read half a dozen years ago has left passages fresh in ones memory still  gentleman

hardys wessex and mr raymonds somerset is not greater topographically than in their books yet he who would compare the two or judge one county superior to the other deserves to lose both it is because

the devils chain by e jenkins mp london  strahan  co 1876 people who have seen mr cruikshanks design called the bottle which is a large canvas containing hundreds of groups of drunkards perhaps find it not very easy to understand how mr matthew arnold came to write a sonnet to the artist the bottle is scarcely a work of art it has indeed a central interest but that interest is a moral purpose and no one can say that the picture of the crowds of boozy and bulbous figures is one that gives pleasure to the spectator  say what shall calm us when such guests intrude like comets on the heavenly solitude   asks the poet and the reviewer may be allowed to say that mr jenkins story the devils chain on which he has no intention of writing a sonnet is more a moral comet of the bottle sort than a work of art indeed mr jenkins admits that he has not tried to write a pleasing work of fiction his aim is  to exhibit in rude stern truthful outlines the full features of the abuses he would humbly help to remove the abuses are those that spring from the traffic of drink  mr jenkins finds men dining comfortably and voting steadily in utter disregard of their fell disastrous and diabolical effects he  cannot acquit himself of having too long done the like one hopes that mr jenkins will continue to vote with his wonted steadiness  it would not however be easy for a sensitive person to dine comfortably immediately after reading his devils chain the devil8 chain is a tissue of horrors the first link shows us a woman of bad character and of about fortyfour years of age entertaining a secretary of state and a young gentleman who had left balliol at the age of nineteen after a distinguished career with brandy sherry and champagne this is bad enough but the secretary had scarcely time to tell his precocious friend that their hostess was a mrs hurlingham sister of their acquaintance captain conistoun when she leapt out of the window and fell dead at the feet of her husband who was staggering past in the last stage of drunkenness but one on beholding this spectacle miss lucy merton a virtuous grisette fainted and was entertained by a young man a total stranger with the refreshment of hot brandy and water an unpleasant episode follows about which we shall merely say that the christian name of the total stranger is singularly illchosen meantime the secretary of state had wrapped himself up in a large cloak which he wore for purposes of disguise when pursuing his nefarious pleasures and had retired with the balliol man from the disastrous scene mr jenkins may have borrowed the cloak from pericles prince of tyre act iv scene 6  here comes the lord lysimachus disguised a coroners inquest was held on the dead woman and mr jenkins points out with very great force and truth the wretched results of the unseemly habit of holding coroners inquests in public houses at the inquest the drunken husband is brought forward and a letter is read which had been addressed to him by his deceased wife why did she call him henry when his name was lucius why did mrs merton p 167 call her husband john when his name p 155 was william  or do people change their names when they take to drink joseph cray becoming john cray in part of the narrativeas they do when they enter religion  but mr jenkins has not aimed at artistic results the coroner elicits the facts that lucius or henry hurlingham was a man of family and wealth that his wife took to brandy and other sins that he had followed her example till he sank with a life of gindrinking and that the pair had a daughter whose education was conducted at the expense of mrs hurlingham business being over the coroner described as a gentleman goes and gets drunk with un nomme bugby described as a newspaper reporter and leaderwriter do coroners get drunk  do journalists of standing attend coroners inquests do reporters of inquests write leaders  let us next follow the fortunes of the balliol man he was the son of a rich scotch distiller named bighorne he had done well at eton which he must have left at about fifteen and at the university but in three fatal years this promising boy was morally ruined by  constant visits to the tastingroom  in his fathers distillery bighorne peer had sent him into the business where he grew too fond of the paternal gin as confectioners apprentices do of pastry henry bighornes sister is a study of the brighter side of life  the oval sweet yet firmly featured face with that noble wealth of original hair wreathed up in plaits and curls upon the symmetrical head in grecian fashionthe slightly aquiline nose exquisite mouth and chin the skin mantled with a complexion purely and gloriously englishall this made miss emily bighorne bother her patronymic and may she soon exchange it for a better a subject of admiration which could well endure the rivalry of the artists who had showered their works upon the home of the wealthy distiller of british brandy and gin this heroine had a very natural hatred of her fathers business for as she worked among the poor in westminster she knew that the paths of ginmaking lay hold upon hell but she could not even rescue her  brother who borrowing some money from her fled away and hid himself for fear of compromising the reputation ofthe secretary i of state and so bringing down the govern  ment of the hour the place where iiq fled to was the hut of a drunken prizefighting j scoundrel employed in ironworks near j burslem this man bill knowsley got j drunk on the money given him by bighorne j kicked his wife to death and killed all his i six children in this scene mr jenkins has i painted with great power a kind of event which is perfectly familiar to all of us from report and which probably has never been common in any savagery or in any civilisation except that of happy england to be brief henry bighorne dies of fever and exposure in the house of a curate  the daughter of the hurlinghams runs away heaven knows why with a drunken sot of a middleaged parson and we last see her in a musichall a few other characters here and there including the drunken clergyman and a dissenting tradesman die of drink and the secretary of state his disguise not availing him leaves england in a ship most of whose crew are intoxicated and is lost in a fire at sea being last seen in the act of throwing his famous cloak over a halfnaked girl perhaps we should be grateful to any writer who keeps before our eyes the condition of our civilisation perhaps the sermon against taking alcohol in moments of exhaustion cannot too often be preached it may even be allowed that fic tion is a good medium for morality but one fails to see how the heaping up of so many thickcoming horrors in one small volume can awaken any useful feeling this is the weak point of all stories with a purpose in novels dated about 1786 we know that the virtuous peasant will suffer in one day all the woes that are spread over the whole history of the villein and in temperancetales we look for the horrors of a year crushed into a few weeks and we are not disappointed mr jenkins does not attempt to prescribe the purge for the evils he catalogues and it is not likely that his book will arouse any one to the sense of these evils who was not alive to them before it is a shameful thing that the trade in liquor should be  forced  by advertisements and by public houses started by distillers it is a wretched thing that society should be based on forms of labour which disfigure the body and that the labourer should find

novels ethel churchill or the two brides by the author of the im provisatrice francesca carrara traits and trials of early life c 3 vol colburn within the last two months no less than four novels have emanated from the press and from the fair hands of ladies  the vicar of wrexhill is probably the most powerful work of the fourour opinions on  uncle horace and  stokeshill place have been already given but we like  ethel churchill better than any of them the reflections which abound in this work are instructive and judicious at the same time that they are dictated by experience in the world and sound sense the epoch at which the tale commences is fixed in the reign of george ii and thus miss landon has been enabled to introduce the reader to lady mary wortley montague pope gay swift and walpole and to make him famili arly acquainted with the reigning wits and literati of the age this scheme is somewhat in imitation of portions of mr bulwers  devereux  but the whole is admirably executed and evinces the perseverance and research which miss landon must have used to render herself so intimately conversant with the minds manners and peculiarities of the learned or remarkable individuals she brings upon the stage lady marchmont is well drawn but the character is we hope somewhat unnatural in fact her atrocious deeds are the only objectionable portion of the work which we discovered during an attentive perusal the personal appearance and morale of lord marchmont a peer of those times is admirably described lord marchmont was about thirty years of age and what is generally called a finelooking man his figure was good so far as his height and proportion went but his movements wanted ease and consequently grace and there was something of selfimportance in his airthe last thing in the world to prepossess a beholder in his favour we may admit the superiority of another but we very much object to his assuming it as an undeniable fact lord marchmonts features were good with a strongly marked aquiline nose but the mouth neither gave sweetness nor the eye light to his face his eyes were of a dim cold blue that never seemed to vary they were unfamiliar with tears and the pupil never brightened with laughter 1his lips were thin and when they did smile it was stiff and made up like the embroidery on his coat his dress was splendidhis hands glittered with ringshis snuffbox was covered with diamonds and his ruffles were of the finest mechlin lace the only fault was the want of harmony in colouring the one hue destroyed the effect of the other i am persuaded that where there is no eye for colours something of that keen susceptibility is wanting which constitutes the poetical and picturesque and certainly to neither of these qualifications had his lordship the slightest claim his style of conversation was made up of set sentences and his manners were overbearing to his inferiors in their estimation and tiresome to his equals his mind was made up of lessons and examples he only reasoned by precedentsevery thing with him went by example and it was relief to him when he could quote an authority if he had a passion it was love of money he loved it both for its own sakethat close kind of attachment which money certainly doe8 inspireand also for the enjoyments that it could procure he liked the pleasures of the table and he liked attendance he was a sort of sublime port to his valets ge nerally speaking his comprehension was slow and his ideas narrow but the moment his own interest was concerned it was astonishing how his perception enlarged he became cautious if not enlightened and cunning if not shrewd in short his character might be summed up in a wordlord marchniont was an intensely selfish man  the description of

jewels yet shining in it lay constance norbourne life was fast ebbing away and the physician had said there was no hope there she lay white as the pillow on which she rested for the last time a dull film had gathered over the eves which yet dwelled lovingly on the friends beside her and the fallen mouth with the faint purple circle around it indicated the near approach of death  0 0 4 again her head dropped on the pillow and her father and husband felt the hands that had clasped theirs relax their faint pressure and again henrietta wiped away the cold dews that stood on her forehead she lay for some minutes motionless save when the heavy eyelids were slowly raised and her dim eyes yet dwelled fondly on those who watched her last movement all at once her eves kindled and she again raised herself with a little assistance from henrietta     she sank back fainting but this time it was norbournes arm that supported her once again her eyes unclosed and fixed on her husbands face with an expression of the most utter tendernesswhence they never moved more the eyelids closed wearily and there was a convulsive movement in the hands then came a frightful st illness broken by a low

dismissing  ethel churchill we cannot but express a regret that our limits do not allow us to make more elaborate extracts it is an excellent work and far superior to any other of miss landons prose productions  ethel churchill or thc two brides reviews by miss landon 3 vols colburn we find in though prose writings of miss landon the same warmth of feeling as in her verse the language only is changed the genius that prompts it is the same but the qualities that have established her fame as a poetess occasionally interfere with the full development of her powers as a writer of novels in all we admit there are fine and noble thoughts beautifully expressed lier personages think wisely tenderly or romantically as suits her purpose they speak eloquently and wittily but they seldom act her novels in fact are more records of feelings than narratives of events instead of giving her full attention to working out a character or unravelling an artfully involved plot she pours forth from the fullness of her own heart a profusion of deep and eloquent reflections which though excellent in themselves do not assist in thc progress of the story but readers must be more critical than we are disposed to he if they find much fault with a habit from which they derive so much pleasure these episodes indeed are the characteristics of miss landons style  and we confess we would not exchange them for an improvement in the mere machinery of a novel  ethel churchill contains many examples both of the beauties and the defects we have noticed in such an abstract of it as we could find room for we could not do justice to its merits and we shall therefore not attempt any account of thc plot and yet as we are anxious to give a specimen of the style of ethel churchillwe must inform the reader that the real heroine of the book is a certain henrietta countess of marchmont whose character of a gay beautiful leader of fashionable life full of wit and with a recklessness of manner which fails to hide even from herself the pangs of a too sensitive heartstands in admirable contrast with the stiff pompous and selfconceited nothingness of her lord and master this lady soon after her marriage becomes acquainted with lady mary wortley montagu pope jay and the other wits of the period who are brought very vividly before us and has proceeded to such lengths in follies and flirtations that she fears a rebuke from her husband for the levity which she is conscious cannot have escaped his observation on the death of poor constance courtenay which is very pathetically described the countess had paid her friends memory the respect of wearing black clothes av bile mourning over the melancholy fate of constance a rap at the door of her closet interrupted her soliloquy  i thought muttered she  that i hud given strict orders that no ono should be admitted well como in  and lord marchmont made his appearance tho very person i most wished to so  exclaimed henrietta starting up eagerly to receive him my dear lady marchmont your energy is positively startling said he slowly articulating his wonk and deliberately seating himself in an armchair which ho moved twice once to

continued she to talk to you about   perhaps madam interrupted lord marchmont in a slow and solemn tone  you will accord j me my privilege of speaking first i have also much to say to you i  it was now henriettas turn to seek a comfortable position  and sinking back on the sofa she  began to pick another rose to pieces to this his j lordship paid no attention he had a certain number of words to say and though idea never crossed him but that they must be of paramount interest isle rarely looked at the person to whom he was talking his glance dwelled either on his feet or his hands or his snutfboxsomething in short that was more peculiarly his own  to say nothing of occasional glances j at the lookingglass opposite lie talked as if he were reading aloud and that in the most monotonous manner  it is my duty madam to tell you he began in a solemn tone that i exceedingly disapprove of your conduct  henriettas colour rose  this is the first time i have heard of it exclaimed she   if you pray madam do not interrupt mesaid lord marchmont  you may be quite sure that i never make an assertion which 1 am not prepared to prove i again repeat that i exceedingly disapprove of your

while we were walking in the mall together and i could not but be struck by its profound truth 1 am not above being instructed whatever madam you may think to the contrary henrietta bit her lip to prevent herself from skiving that the task of instruction appeared to her in this instance a viry hopeless one and his lordship went on to observei am sorry to see that this morning even you persist in disobeying me i repeat that 1 entirely disapprove of your line of conduct  why what am i doing now but listening to you  is that what you disapprove   to listen to me madam is your duty though said he in a voice growing every moment more solemn i regret to say that you pay but little attention to it again i assert that i have only too much reason to complain of your conduct it is rather alarming in a conjugal titeiitite when your husband tells you he only comes to complain of your conduct and lord marchmont severity of aspect was quite awful  however henrietta only gave him a look of inquiry and he went on  lt was full three days tgo that i told you how 1 hated the sight of black yet you wore it yesterday evening i and 1 observe that your ribbons are black thia i morning tears started in though countesss eyes but she repressed them and forcing a smile tait  i am glad to find that it is not my conduct but my dress that meets your disapprobation i thought replied her husbandand the event proves that i was right in so thinking that you would only laugh at what 1 should urge but women aro incapable of a serious thought  well returned lady marchmont at all events you must allow mo to be flattered at the in forest you take in my peisonal appearance    the character on which miss landon appears to have bestowed though highest finish and which j she has traced through all its fortunes with j the greatest care is that of walter maynard j in the possession of high talent and filled with i the purest feelings the young dependant on literary exertion soon linds that the

miss landon are bestowed we sincerely trust that it is not from experience that she speaks in the following passage   how constantly has mortification accompanied triumph  with what secret sorrow has

the deemster  a romance by hall caine in 3 vols chatto this book would be welcome if only on the ground that it is well worthy of the author of the shadow of a crime in shifting his scene of action from the hills of cumberland to the isle of man mr hall caine has left behind him none of his three great gifts of imagination pathos and humour and he has found a people even more distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages to draw to himself in his fathers lifetime all his fathers property and turns his defrauded brother out of doors it is he who buys his wife of her father the archdeacon and breaks her heart with his infidelity in the first years of their married life it is he who cultivates the evil in his nephew dan and invents the lie which brings about the death of his own son ewan all through the book from the beginning to the welldeserved misery of his death he acts as a subtle malign influence poisoning the air little he gets by it except his barren position of power and the hatred of ail utterly without religion but superstitious to extreme his time is spent in doing illdeeds and striving to bribe providence to avert punishment one of the least adroit and most ridiculous of villains the evil he tries to do is always rebounding on his own head and the devil himself must have laughed when after haranguing the people and the bishop his brother as to the illdeeds of the bishops son and declaring that he will not lift a finger against the man who killed him he turns round to find that the corpse which was the subject of his oration was not that of his nephew but of his own son ewan the fact that the evil done by the deemster is not generally the exact injury contemplated by him but the casual action of a spirit of evil emanating from his infernal disposition is characteristic of the book it is not by themselves only and their passions that the fates of the principal characters are determined  and it is this which distinguishes the deemster rom what are usually called  romances the term serves to distinguish it from the novel or picture of modern life and manners but despite its narrativeform the spiritual grandeur of its conception and the tremendous character of the forces engaged raise it to the region of tragic drama among these forces the passions of though characters no doubt play the greatest part but above beyond and around these are the unseen if not supernatural powers of accident it is not without the aid of a network of circumstance woven by superstition and misconception and a thousand other impalpable devils that the noble natures of dan and ewan are brought into collision and dragged down to death and hell what mr hall caine calls the perfidy of circumstance is the great motor of the drama and dreams and presages second sight and curses superstitious terrors and evil thoughts all of them giving wings as it were to diverse spirits of evil which make a havoc of noble characters and lives of fair promise perform for him much the same office as the loves and hatreds of the gods with their emissaries of fates and furies dreams and omens for the poets and dramatists of greece it is this that raises the deemster into the rank of highest art and makes it not so much a romantic story of a few human individuals as a tragic poem of human life and fate yet the manner is that of a simple tale the characters are not complex they speak plain unconventional unpoetical english often the homespun of manx of analysis of character there is little the narrative if singularly vivid and abounding in remarkable incident is told without strain  fine  as the writing is in the best artistic sense there is not a word of what is usually called  fine writing to use an epithet once in favour with critics the method of presenting the facts to the reader is objective everything is described as if seen the characters are left mainly to reveal themselves by their deeds and the speech born of occasion the reader is a spectator not a confidant in describing the childhood of dan and ewan and mona the author employs anecdote mainly to distinguish character and even with regard to the deemster the most subtle of all the charactew we learn more by watching his deeds and listening to his words than by explanation of the author mr hall caine however mikes us know his men and women as well as if he told us all about them taeir presence their gestures the greater motives of their being are clear to us it is no minute and detailed portraiture but it is complete so far as is needed to distinguish one soul from another in force dan mylrea the bishops ungovernable son stands out clear from the resta being of intemperate will and passion beyond control but noble and honest withal capable of falling deeper and rising higher than ordinary mortals a scapegrace and prodigal on a grand scale gifted with the splendid health enormous strength and generous nature which made him a hero to his inferiors with the worst part of his nature j encouraged by his uncle the deemster and the best part of it but weakly attracted by the saintly example of his father the bishop he spends a youth of riot and instead of entering the church becomes the proprietor of a fishing smack after drinking away with his men the years earnings of the boat he pays his crew with a bill on which he forges the name of his cousin  the pazon as security ewan saves him from disgrace hy acknowledging the signature but his father casts him off and ewan while permittiog him to live in his house withdraws his friendship and forbids him from intercourse with his sister mona now the love between ewan and dan had surpassed the love of women and mona had been his dearest playfellow so was dan cut off from all the good influences of his life  they are taking the wrong way with me said dan dan does not improve he ruins his father by mismanaging his farm commits numerous excesses and the relations between himself and ewan become more and more strained one day a vile story is told to ewan by his father the deemster and maddened by the belief that dan has seduced mona he seeks him with a murderous heart pride and passion forbidding explanation they fight like devils and ewan reels and falls over the cliff far from this being the end of the story the events that follow are even more original striking and terrible and reveal more completely the genius of the author the truly tragic scene between dan and mons in which mona declares her love for the slayer of her brother the attempt of dan and his crew to bury the body at sea when it slips its weights and sails away to land the return of the boat the surrender of dan and his terrible expiation under the sentence of his father and the final scenes of the sweating sickness and the part dan played therein are all grandly conceived and grandly executed no doubt much fault might be found with the book while calling itself a romance it aims at such an appearance of literal truth that we cannot help asking ourselves if oil crist mylrea was really the bishop of mw at the beginning of last century and was brother to the deemster and our confidence in its realistic veracity on the one hand and our acceptance of the romantic illusion on the other are both weakened the book is too full of extraordinary incidents the curse of mrs kerruish is fulfilled so fully and literally the secondsight of kerry is so terribly accurate the story proceeds by such a constant succession of marvels that it is only the singular skill with which they are introduced and the convincing manner with which they are described that prevent faith from halting but after all these are small things compared with the undeniable grandeur and beauty of this work of art cosmo monkhouse,biography_contra

readable kind it is oll margalet wm3 be a dainty dish but on the other hand it is we fear a style which is only too easily abused and those who care to compare old mararet with  ravensboe will be apt to fancy that mir kingsley has taken to  scamp illg work we have his own authority for saying that if a man can write well or paint well he will get quite as well paid by the  trade  as ever he was by any prince whio ever lived but the worst of it is that the trade pay so well that there is a temptation to  scamping work9 we fear the temptation is only too strong it is for instance an unardonable offence in a real master of english to adopt a slipshod colloquial style of narrative and to shirk the trouble of writing carefully by availing himself of the lazy device of taklirg his reader into his confidence and talking to hin in the same strain as that in which the owner of the puppetshow in don quixote addresses his audience and we may also add some of the epigrams in old margaret are by no means good but simply as bad as they can well he why for instance should we be told that in this last painful and horrible year it is perfectly obvious that a german has only to come into one end of a field to make a frenchman run out at the other in the first place the statement is not true in the second place even if it were true it would not be funny in the third place even if it were ever so funny it would none the less be in very questionable taste taste however is not mr kingsleys strong point indeed he seems to be much attached to what lie calls the  coarse manners of the age of whicch he writes and does not forget to assure us twice at least if not oftener in his first two hundred pages that in those days all men slept nakeda fact which lie brings home to us with pecua liarly vivid pictorial effect an rest we are not disposed to find fault with either mfr kingsley or his tale there is it is true a certain sameness in all the characters especially in all the men which is partly perhaps due to the fact that they all discourse in epigram worthy of monostich dialogue in a greek play and partly to the fact that an element of the authors own personality enters far too perceptibly into each but ghient and the glientish habits of life are sketched very vividly if not very truthfully the outline is firm the colour is bold the whole picture is in its way a wellpreserved van eyck among swashbuckling fireeating swordsmen cruel murderous princes ruffianly italian bravos and keen sententious old statesmen mr kingsley is in his element more particularly he is at honie with spadathe real hero of the taleand who is a middlesized bull necked italian of about thirty dressed in white with crimson slaslhes with a scarlet bonnet and an ostrich plume of the same colour coming dlowil over his left shoulder a bulletlheaded man with an eye like polishcl jet and a beard like closely packed black horsehair elasticity and vigour in his carriage and a good

swpme ithe motives are needlessly and horribly coniplicated i those who read 011 margaret  carelessly will be sure to like it it is a capital book for the beach or iu boat or for the pier it is exactly the right length and the interest is never allowed to flag to those who read it carefully the notion will possibly suggest itself that mr kingsley could if he chose write a really good novel in which cesare borgia and mnfacchiavelli whould take a leading part isle has indeed a certain affection for notorious ruffians whom he contrives to treat tenderlyas if he loved them and lie is as epigrammatic as ever s  the prince  itself but here he w ill be writing againls no less a competitor than the author of iromola and lie must write more carefully than he has written in  old

of its moldavian neigibour tiis little known corner of europe is the subjet of miss dowios hook the year of her visit is not given but we bolievo it to have been 1890 the political inforniation is rather scrappy but what there is of it is fresh and to the point evidently miss dowie regards politics as uninteresting and indeed out of place in describing a happy country where the peasants own their land and where persons of the landlord class are not to be found  oppressions rackrentinig and evictions were unknown evils of that i was assured  and beyond this i felt that a political condition is not a bad one if you hear nothing of it the fortunate peasant proprietors of galicia printipally belong to the rithenian the pole and the luzul nationalities  the huzul says franzos p 3 is a hybrid uniting the slavonic blood of the ruthen with the mongolian blood of the uzen his speech bowraying the former while his name testifies to ei latter the 11uzuls are said to be the only known riding mountaineers save a certain tribe of the caucasus the breed of horses used by theni is also said to resemble those of their caucasian cognates keeping all this in mind writes loopold von lacher masoch the hungarian novelist p 193  it may be held with some show of reason that at the great wandering of the earths peoples when the slays were inl the van the ihuzuls were easily driven across the plains and pouned in the karpathians while their neighbours of the plains were split up broken and intermixed with the germanic races and later with huns hungarians tartars mongolians and turks thus the hluznts safe in their karpathian faistnesses preserve their haracter the the slav or if you vill admit it the caucasian character free pure and warked to this day no falcon can live caged so runs the proverb no ihuzul in bondage miss dowio was not much thrown with this wild and warlike people but consorted more with the ruthenian of the plain and the pol whose ancestors conquered and colonised the country however beauty and picturesqueness are the creation of the eye and the mind and a traveller so richly endowed as miss dowie would write an attractive account of her travels wherever her dan and beersheba were situated the charm of the book is undeniable the style and the matter are alike sparkling and bright the reader who can begin a fl in the karpathians and can close it before he has finished its 0 pages must either he very dull or very prooccupied the language like that of the ifeathien chinee is free and cannot be doseribed as a i well of english undefiled  but you never miss the meaning nor are you wearied by repetition or verhosity patriotism makes us glad that so clever a book was written by a compatriot  but were it not for her frequent roferences to scotland the authores might pass for a yankeo  i give the end of this authoritative paragraph purely for its own sako  to me says miss iowie after quoting 1franzos the terms employed seem a sizo or so too large miss dowic is we feel sure nothing if not sincore we will not therefore flatter her the flaw in this lively and readable bolok is a certain cheap cynicism or flippancy of tone franzos is generally admitted to be one of the two great living authors of south german y the son of a doetor in a little galician town the ilarnow of his stories franzos is par excelnce the hilumlorist of galicia yet miss dowie in writinlg of the coumntry refers to its greatest ian of letters only in slighting terms the ruthenian peasant appears to bec a pagan in everything except his oaths we are told that  upon the immorality the blind unrepentent wholesale immorality of the peasants the priests of tie iunited greek church exercis no cheeck there appears to be no such thing as a moral standard in any ruthenian village they are ihowever neither illogical nor hypocritical  what do the men think when they see the young women drunk asked miss dowie  iow should they mind   was the answer are they not drunk too  no wonder that after the scene in the publichouse to which the peasants adjourned from their church miss dowie retired to a pine wood with  qualms of wrongheaded western disgust she did not remain there very long and the following paragraph is too characteristic not to quote  that sunday afternoon i ended only with it halfcross halfamused feeling that hang it there the people were and one miight us well take an interest in them and not sheer off at the first evidences of a depressing lack of sanity colossal soiiousness and lone prayerful depression would be of slight avail i might as well be cherful so down i went from my mountain with a vague notion that having recourse to mountains when the worries of this world become overwhelming is a very old gunie and some one whose

without prejudice tliere is no persecution of the jews as the peasantry do not resent their supremacy the jew is practical enterprising  the zuthenian has the negatives of these qualities the consequence is that the trade of the country is almost exclusively in the hands of jews but this is no hardship with the ruthenian  lie neither cares for wealth nor for what it brings miss dowio tells an incident that happened during her stay in mikuliczyn a man who wanted his house roofed went to a peasant whose trade was woodslate dressiiig alnd setting and attempted to extract an estimate and press a contract upon him the peasant woulh not accept a contract and would not give an estimate so the man had recourse to a jewn  leave it to me said the jew as lie went to the hut of the very peasant who had refused the offer of the job having extracted all necessary information the jew made his akulation saw his employer gave him an estimate entered into a contract set his peasant to work at a small daily wage and secured for himself a handsome profit does the peasant resent such treatment  according to miss dowiecertainlv not ier description of her encounter with the jewess will reveal a new trait in the foreign hebrew to most english readers at a halfway house where miss dowie stopped to eat some food she took a plate from the shelf to place her sheeps cheese upon the fury of her hostess when she returned and saw her guest using her plate was curious to read of the indescribably dirty jewess considered the scotch lady  unclean it gradually dawned on our authoress that she was a christian and therefore in a technical sense indubitably unclean she accordingly bought the plate and slipped it into her sack the loss of her property which had been purchased at its owners valuation was again too much for the innkooper who upbraided her guest both as a christian and a robber the treatment she received from the ruthenian peasants and the polish gentlemen with whom she stayed was very different aliss dowios book is proof if proof were wanting that an accurate and picturesque account of a people can be written by one ignorant of their language in a country not five thousand miles away from galicia the queen of england was some years ago represented by a very able diplomatist who reckoned among his many accomplishments a knowledge of the native language although the press of the country was an open book to him the people of the country remained an unsolved mystery le did not like them lie misread their characters their aspirations and their hopes happily for all concerned this very able and amiable man for lie was both got the promotion which he deserved le was followed by a gentleman who though unable to read their newspapers liked the connon folk and sympathised with them in their hopes and aspirations le therefore knew the country and its inhabitants a thousandfold better than his more learned but less sympathetic predecessor as with diploiatists so with travellers the key to a good book of travel is sympathy with the people among whom you travel miss dowie has struck this note in every page of her book we have referred to the cynicism which crops up now and again but in truth this cynicism is not more than worddeep miss dowio describes with profound insight the poor ignorant peasantry she has far too much humour to be a severe judgo even her verbal cynicism disappears when she enters cracow  suddenly a choir of trunpets breaks out into a chorale from the big church tower the melancholy of it i never shall forgetthe very melody seemed so old and tired so worn and sweet and patient like cracow those trumpet notes have mouried in that tower for hundreds of years it is the hymn of timeless sorrow that they play and the key to which they are attuned is cracows long despair hush that is her voice the old towns voice high and sad she is spealdng to you the map is in itself a valuable lesson in history showing as it does the widest extent of poland prior to its dismemberment the illustrations are pretty and the drawing by a fletcher on p 131 is charming miss dowie in her closing sentence remarks that she does not flatter herself that her readers would hid her write often we have far too good an opinion of miss dowie to wish her such a fate but we do hope that this book will not be her last j g cotton

the secret dispatch  or the adventures of cap tam balgonie by james grant virtue cv uo russians must look back with a strange mixture of pride and pain to the thirtyfour years reign of catherine the second it is certain that none of her predecessors had ruled the people with a more iron hand or crushed them into ignobler bondage yet it may be questioned if any did more to raise the status of the empire in the eyes of the world to improve its social condition or to sow the seeds of that progress which has been steadily devel oping itself it is matter for surprise indeed  that this critical epoch in russian history has j not attracted far more attention than it has two facts are perhaps the best explanations  that can be given of the neglect one is that little as the rest of europe knows even now j with any certainty of what is going on in the  great eastern country our information today  bears a greater proportion to the information attainable then than the news of english i papers bears to the news of a hundred  years ago the other is that it is only within  the memory of living men that russia has begun to be included even in the range of civili ization much less regarded as a country capable  of anything better than spasmodic changes and unsystematic vagaries whatever the causes however the period from 1762 to 1796 is undoubtedly worthy of vastly more notice than has been given to it and from the pages of levesque mannstein and villebois at least enough can be got to reward the pains of reading them the story and character of catherine alone form a romance by themselves a comj parative parvenue beside ninetenths of her ooort intoxicated by suddenly finding herself rife of a man whose weakness and debaucheries yjrtually transferred an empire to her hands possessed of a clearheadedness which prevented even her intoxication being more than a useful ally of an ambition which disdained the thought of any restingplace of a heartlessness which stopped at nothing and of an intellect before which the most unmanageable bowed trusted by nobody and hated by all and hardly recognising such a consideration as personal expediency  this medley of profligacy good taste selfishness and generosity eclipses in our eyes her more famous predecessor peter this characterthe patron of art science and  education the originator of a methodical administration of justice the introducer of vaccination among her subjects the founder unless we are mistaken of the second foundling hospital in the world and the inpersonation of cruelty aud vice  mr grant has chosen for the foundation of his hst historical novel it is not often that we have to complain of novelists that they do not make their books long enough but we cannot  help thinking a mistake has for once been committed in the present case better materials than catherines entire reign we need hardly  say nobody could have had at handall the  better for a work of fiction by reason of the frequent absence of certainty as to minutia mr grant however though he has studied his subject has selected one little incident one of the darkest amid a crowd of dark ones and contented himself with moulding it into a onevolume tale the incident is this on the death of anne in 1742 her grandnephew ivan the sixth styled by mr grant ivan the  fourth had succeeded to the thronean infant less than a year oldonly however to be deposed and imprisoned within a few months by elizabeth when elizabeths successor peter the third was in his turn deposed and imprisoned by his wife catherine the latter found ivan now a youth of about twentyfour a dangerous obstacle to her security  and on the discovery of a conspiracy to restore him to his rights at once had him privately put to death in his dungeon out of this it is that the volume before us is constructedthe secret dispatch being the empresss order for the assassination sent to the governor of the state prison by one of the many british officers then in the russian service the perils he went through in carrying his charge from novgorod to st petersburg the chapter of accidents by which he became betrothed to the sister of the chief conspirator and the eminently disagreeable complications to which his loveaffairs led interwoven with a few pictures of russian society are the sumtotal of a book which might with advantage have been three times as long as to what there is we have no hesitation in saying it is worth reading probably indeed it gains in interest about as much as it loses by want of substance a little lovetale of only three years scope if it is well toldas this is just melancholy enough to enlist ones sympathies ending just happily enough not to bring on the blues and keeping the sentimental part of ones nature on perpetual tenterhooks by all sorts of lifeordeath tossups has something pleasant in its very sound and as a novel of this kind it is undoubtedly the most successful the author oas produced as an historical one we have already expressed disappointment on one ground and on another point we wink there is a want of sound judgment history put into the persuasive form of fiction ttght not to be altered more than is absolutely requisite for the purposes of art not only do all such unnecessary changes prevent a book being of real use but they are apt to do positive harm by causing it to leave wrong impressions behind why then should mr grant have gone out of his way to represent the incident on which the whole of his story turns differently from the fact  it would have been just as easy to mould his plot on the true account of mierowitzs mad conspiracy as on a purely imaginative one while no interest whatever is added by the gratuitous inaccuracy of representing the conspirators attacking ivans prison from without instead of according to unanimous authority taking advantage of their position as the garrison of the fortress itself in minor details such as mierowitzs social grade the actual origin of his animosity towards catherine and in others of little or no importance the romancer is fairly entitled to his licence but the best principle on which to go from step to step is that the less deviation there is from fact the better we should be sorry however to convey to anybody the idea that the book is on the whole untrustworthy on the contrary it contains more than one excellent sketch of russian social life in the last century,biography_contra
the thirce perils of ioman or love j leazinq and jealousy a series of i domestic scottish tales by james hogg 3 vols 12mo london 1823 authors like warriors get spoiled by success and tempt fortune too far this has been the case with the ettrick shepherd who though really possessing considerable talents and a lively imagination cannot wnrte every thing and we must frankly tell him that if he will attempt to force three volumes on the public every year that he will soon be without readers except such as contract with a circulating library and make a point of gulping every thing published under the name of a novel or a romance it is now some fifteen months since mr boggy published his  three perils of man a work with which we were at some pains to make our readers acquainted we did justice to the interest of the narrative and to the vigrour of some of the descriptions while at the same time we pointed out some glaring absurdities and expressed our regret at some peccahilloes including a rrr fane paroly on scripture all ads tions and remonstrances are thrown away on s 1m persons and mr iiooappears to be onie of the number we thought it mnight be enowyh to give a hint and hesitate dislike but some of our contemlporaries were more severe upon him thjough evidently to no purpose for his nosywv work sins more daringrly and more frequently against religion modesty and good breeding w1 e confess we have read the three perils of woman and indeed mr hogfgs former romance to some disadvantage on account of our imperfect knowledge of the barbarous jarcron he so copiously introduces in the novel before us he has puzzled us sadly and never was our jamieson so thumbed or our glossaries so frequently consulted to enable us to translate the  three perils of woman for our own right understanding and gratification and not for that of our family to whom we soon found we must make it a sealed book we have heard it remarked that our english readers affect to admire the wxaverly novels in proportion as they do not understand them  should this be the case with m1r hloggs romance his  three perils will be the most popular work on this side of the tweed that ever appeared for a great portion of the narrative is in a jargon which would puzzle all the linguists in christendomjames hogg ex cepted the babellike confusion of tonguesfor to call it a langouage would be improper is we suspect not thu roughly understood by any individuals in scotland save those hawkers whose itinerant life renders them familiar with the lowest provincial dialects of every village in caledonia a more serious charge remains to be made against mr hoggthat of vulgarity indecency and even blasphemy it has been too much the customn lately for the edinburgh novelwriters to interlard their fictions with appeals to the deity and the services of the church mr flioog thought he must be in fashion and how he has succeeded we shall show presently we recollect reading in some work the author of which appeared to think a joke nonesl the worse for being profane that an atheist in a storm at sea thus concluded a prayer to the dilkity for preservation hear my prayer 0 lord this time for thou knowest i

darg grant us a remission of our manifold sins wve might perhaps be accused of treating mr hogg unfairly if we here closed our notice though an author who writes thus irreverently can offer little atonement by less exceptionable portions of his work there is an old proverbthat one man may with equal impunity steal a horse as another look over the hedge  and certainliv we do think that if the three perils of wonman had been published by carlile or benbow they would have run a fourth perilthat of a prosecution by the attorneygeneral but much as we censure mlr hogg for his irreverence we will confess that he stands not single in this respect it is too frequently a vice of the pulpit and one which forms one of the hear i i viest blots on the preaching of his countryman mr irving who

not attempt the slightest outline of either of these tales but merely observe that they frequently display gleams of the vigorous intellect of the ettrick shepherd that some of the characters are well drawn a few of the incidents natural and striking and some of the descriptions particularly those relating to the rebellion of 1745 are powerful and affecting if any of our readers wish to know more

constance herbert by geraldine e jfwsbuuy 3 vols london  hurst and blackett 1855 it seldom falls to our lot to take up a novel in which the writer has contrived to engage and interest the feelings of the readers more completely than in the one now before us miss jewsbury the authoress has in the present instance dealt somewhat largely in madness and sudden death and the rewards bestowed upon the virtuous appear rather meagre when contrasted with the punishments allotted to the wicked nevertheless the general feeling which is likely to result from the perusal of so many terriblo events is not one calculated to leave a morbid impression upon the mind since the 44 morale  of the book is sound and the chances are that most persons would return to the history of their own lives with increased satisfaction after contemplating upon paper so much wholesale miser in the second volume we have a glimpse of aunt margaret endeavouring to console the heroine constance herbert in the midst of a terrific affliction by reciting to her the still greater woes encountered by herself in earlier days we presume on the principle of larochefoucauld who tells us 44that in the misfortunes even of our best friends there is something not altogether displeasing to us at the conclusion of the aunts story the heroine with great naivete is made to express her astonishment that people ever should succeed in living to the age of eighty  indeed we fully under such circumstances agree with the heroine in her doubts and can suggest no moro practical expedient for struggling through such a weight of calamity than a box of parrs life pills the male characters in this book are by no meads pleasing specimens of the  genus homo charles herbert the father of the heroine who turns out eventually a wretch possesses in his early life a degree of credulity and trustfulness that is quite refreshing in these days of doubt and scepticism for instance he falls in love with though daughter of  a respectable yeoman who is a refined superior young woman failing to obtain the parents consent to the marriage be departs for india where shortly after his father informs him in a letter of kate hathertons the superior young womans marriage with somebody else the way hi which the news is received by charles herbert we give in the authors own words  charles herbert suffered keenly after this destruction of his hopes but he knew kate hatherton better than his father did and his faith in her was not shaken by her marriage with another man and his affection for her continued as strong as ever on his return home after a lapse of years he finds his ladyelove a widow the meeting is accidental and unexpected he greets her in the following style   kate my kate they grasped each others hands and it was as though they had never parted in the mean time that matters may be complete he has proposed to another lady miss wilmot who has given him her affections and fixed the wedding day this little affair does not appear to give him much uneasiness having as he tells us acquainted miss wilmot of his early attachment he irnagines that now that he has not only found his kate but found her free it does not appear that he over exerted himself in his 6earch miss wilmot is to resign him as a matter of course the abrupt manner in which he acquaints her of this rather startling change in her destiny we quote from the volume before us 441 am come to ask you to dissolve our engagement since this morning i have seen kate hatherton whom i never thought to see in this world again i give you my honour i did not seek her i did not know even that i still loved her till she stood before me in that place you left me this morning i cannot see what good it would do you to marry me knowing what you do for i told you all that kate hatherton had been to me and i tell you now all that she is thero would be no honour if i kept my engagement when the first sight of her made me forget youand myself too if i had been conscious of the hold she had over me i would never have spoken a word to you or to any other woman but it is too late to go into all that now 44 then were you quite indifferent about me  did you never caro for me   gasped miss wilmot 441 tell you sarah that i did not know my own heart i was not indifferent to you i cared for you more than any other woman i ever sawexcept one i loved her before i loved you and i shall love her till i die it is because you are a good woman and because you were my friend before i ever thought of you as my wife that i ara come in this way and because i thought you would see and feel how all this bas befallen miss wilmot sat completely stupefied with the weight and suddenness of the blow that had come upon her but in all wounds the great suffering does not follow immediately and she waa astonished to find how little pain she felt after a dull pause during which she pulled off the riug he had given her when they became engaged she said 44 you are free charlesquite free here is your ring again will you tell my uncle or shall i   44let me tell him said charles 44 and then if he thinks it needful to blow out ray brains he can 41 he will scarcely feel called upon to do that replied miss wilmot with a slight bitterness  charles herbert looked at her for the first time since the interview had begun his eyes had certainly rested upon her but without any personal consciousness that he saw ber sarah i hope with all my soul that i have been a coxcomb and that you do not really care for roe so much as i allowed myself to fancy you will get over it and no one who knows you can believe you to have been slighted a spasm of painful indignation passed across miss wilmots face  charles herbert said she rising  it is because i love yon it is because i was your friend before i was your affianced wife it is because i understand your nature better than any one else in the world is likely to do that i do not blame you for what you have done this day now leave me there is nothing more to say between us in this scene the authoress shows a knowledge of human nature miss wilmots mind is wholly unprepared to receive this cruel intelligence contrary therefore to the usual practice of authors in such cases there is neither immediate fainting nor hysterics but afterwards when her mind has digested all that has taken place she suffers severely enough there are other passages in this book that we might have selected showing the dramatic powers of the authoress to perhaps greater advantage but we abstain from quoting them for fear of diminishing the interest of the story we shall therefore limit ourselves to saying how heartily we concur in the sentiment uttered by aunt margaret  who says the more ones life resembles a novel the more uncomfortable it is and we feel we cannot too strongly recommend our friends to be cautious how they let their lives resemble this one if they can by any means avoid

seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the great mahseerthe  indian salmon socalled though he is one of the cyprinidse barbus tordoes not show sport in proportion to his size we have been seriously informed that he rises at the swallows as they skim the surface and may be taken by a hook baited with one but we do not endorse the statement among the characters to whom we are introduced is an old fakir the descendant of taj khan a former pathan ruler of the district whose story is well and touchingly told another story the  legend of the rajah chand sa and of the hundred headless horsemen is a good specimen of the still flourishing art of storytelling we have now probably said enough to

more than realizes the imaginations of defoe it is the selftold tale of a young man who with his wife and a little dog was wrecked on a reef of rocks enclosing and protecting two small unoccupied islandsand of his residence there for ten or twelve years mr seaward left england when about twentythree as the supercargo of a vessel bound for the bay of honduras in 1733accompanied by his newmarried wife three or four years younger than himself the vessel was driven by a storm upon the rocksthe crew took to the boat which was swampedand seaward and his wife who adhered to the wreck were the sole survivors the return of the tide lifted the vessel off the rocks and enabled him to get it into a creek and thus secure it against future storms with the stores of the vessel they were in no danger of starving and in a spirit of thankfulness for their preservation they quickly bestirred themselves to provide as far as they could for their personal security and comfort the island was very small but they were the lords of it and had no conflicting interests to contend with iguanas peccaries and armadillos were the only animals they met with the first their little dog killedbut the peccaries made fight and gave them some trouble the shore supplied them with mullets and crabs and turtle abounded the stranded vessel was their home and on the island they sowed and planted and domiciliated the ducks and fowls and goats which they had on board seaward laboured hard with the planks which fortunately had formed part of the cargo at building a house and making enclosures for his fruits and corn and stock fondly attached as were seaward and his bride their lone situation drew the chords of affection the closer and the island in a blissful climate was their paradise it is impossible for the coldest heart to read and not melt at the details of their attachment in the island they found a cavethe retreat of large flocks of pigeonswhere their attention was one day attracted by the appearance of artificial brickwork they removed the bricks and discovered a mass of treasuredoubloonsto the extent of forty or fifty thousand pounds with vessels of gold and silver in great abundance chiefly church plate though apparently all this was of no more value to them than the diamond to ajsops cock they carefully closed up the aperture and after some scruples resolved to appropriate the prizethey might not stay there for ever at the end of about six months a boat with five negroestwo men and three womenrunaway spanish slaveslanded and being kindly welcomed proved themselves faithfully devoted to their service seaward was thus relieved from severe personal labour and had nothing further to do than direct the willing industry of his new friends a few more months rolled away when an american vessel appeared off the rocks pursued by a spanish guardacosta seaward and his negroes assisted in repelling the spaniard and in the american which remained some weeks for repairs he finally took a passage for himself his wife and the treasure to jamaicaleaving behind him the negroes with directions till his return at jamaica he took measures for securely transferring his doubloons c to a london banker with a prudence and caution quite exemplary instead of following his treasures he had resolved to return to the island and purchasing a vessel and fitting it out with a cargo of useful matters and a crew of negroes and labourers and a naval officer to commandfurnishing himself also with a commissionfrom the commandant at jamaicahe soon reached again the new settlement soon some relations from england joined them more negroes were obtained from jamaicahis plans prosperedand he resolved to go to england to visit his friends and make preparations for extending the colony in england he found his money growing at perry and childs the bankers and mrs child introduced the wealthy strangers to her fashionable society for which neither seaward nor his wife had much taste intent upon his purpose seaward lost no time in opening a negotiation with the government for the lurchase of the twio islands of which he had himself taken possession for the crown but met with great and apparently insuperable difficultieschiefly as it turned out from not understanding the ministers particular mode of transacting business lie did not readily comprehend the necessity of contributing to sir roberts bribepurse a curious scene of ministerial tactics is laid open for which we have unluckily no space meanwhile mrs seaward had employed mrs childs marituamaker and shown her some beautiful gold stuff quite unparalleled in england mrs childs mantuamaker happened to be the queens also and the tale of the gold stuffs quickly reached the royal ears a visit from the mistress of the robes lady sundon followed mrs seaward presented the stuffs to the queen and was introduced to the royal presence the adventures of herself and husband became naturally the topic of conversation the queen was delighted with the story and with the simple manners of mrs seaward and all difficulties in the husbands negotiation vanished like lightning his demands were granted and himself knighted to the amazement and vexation of sir robert who could not comprehend the manceuvre the queen was at that time regent 1736 all impediments being thus removed the new knight accelerated the supplies for his colony engaged a surgeon and a chaplain and took under his protection a dozen german families recommended by the queeninvesting before he set out a portion of his money in the purchase of the hartland estate in gloucestershire where he established his sisters c then returning to the colony he prosecuted his purposes with activity and both islands were soon in a populous and thriving condition at home however sir robert walpole had not forgotten him and took ample revenge for the mortifications he had sustained lie employed seaward in troublesome negotiations with the spanish commanders on the spanish main and finally singled him out to apologize in the name of the government for some injuries said to have been committed by british vessels this was a perilous service isle refused to accede to the humiliating demands of the spanish commander was thrown into prison and only rescued by vernons capture of the fort again returning to the settlements he found every thing prospering but soon finding himself involved in more business and conflicts than was agreeablethe same necessity no longer continuing and perhaps he himself wearyinghe finally quitted it for his estate in england a gap here occurs in the ms but a few closing pages have escaped which contain his spirited remonstrance with the government relative to their cession of the two little islands to the spaniards the dialogue with the duke of newcastle is most characteristic of that addleheaded but obstinate personage sir edward was compelled to submit and accept of a very inadequate compensation for himself anl his friends this was in 1749 and  now my dear edward said his beloved eliza at the close of this decisive interview with the duke of newcastle  let us return to hartland and finish our days in peace the excellent lady died a few months after sir edward survived till 1774 the ms was placed by his representative in the hands of miss j porter by whose adviceand nothing

months the anecdote is mentioned as the most perfect known instance of sulkiness as they could converse with no others in the book before us we have a specimen which better suits the human character before the fall we have a sort of a mr and also a mrs robinson crusoe in reality though not in name who live like adam and eve in paradise loving and beloved with perfect happiness though only by themselves and we solemnly believe that two amiable people however ennuyes may live together in honeymoon style through having no resources but in themselves it is certain too that persons who have the stores of a whole vessel at command shipwrecked upon a fine uninhabited island in a tropical climate and who are also young and healthy may lead a very patriarchal and agreeable life for such a circumstance attaches to the history of pitcairns island and as necessity is the mother of invention so that son may turn out a very handy bustling and useful fellow such a narrative is now before us and considering it either as a romance or a history it does great credit to miss porter we find in it all the resources of aladdins wonderful lamp  the phraseology however is not in keeping with that of the year 1734 without any supernatural aid it further teaches us that in almost any situation there may be happiness where there is reason and virtue not passion and vice and that civilization

dawn is not indeed even so much as an historical novel for there is next to no construction of plot outside the grim narratives derived from tacitus seneca and their contemjoraries to connected narratives and otters dr farrar has added a multiplicity of materials from the literature of imperial rome at and after the close of the first century with vast labour and perseverance he must have ransacked the satires odes and epigrams as well as the longer works of the most polished latin authors in that most dissolute and demoralised age he has thus put together for the older and younger readers of a sensationloving age a record of deliberate refined and accumulated criminality of murder and lust and cruelty such as would scarcely be found in any other printed book easily accessible to young and impressionable minds though it is true that the author has somewhat softened down the crudest details of neros more ghastly crimes and has avoided altogether the worst features of the age dr farrar has painted this lurid picture for a definite and intelligible purpose in order to exhibit the golden vein of christian faith and profession running through the dense mass of pagan vice and bloodthirstiness and his story ends with the bright refulgence of that dominant faith which was to vanquish the empire of the world considerations of reticence and fastidiousness not to say of exact chronology seem more than once to have given way before the craving of the artist for an effective contrast and certainly it would be impossible to secure a contrast more sharp and striking than that which is here drawn between the ecstasies of the early christian faith and though stews and bloodpits of neros rome mr robertson also deserves credit for a manful effort to restore the historical novel could any man do so with success he would be a benefactor to the age but the aspirant must contend with many difficulties when the greatest of historical novelists aroused the interest of two nations and then of the world he had the benefit of the absence of the scientific historian and of the presence of a vague national pride in though past in our days every boy who has passed the fifth standard is a sworn cosmopolitan and our writers have agreed to bless humanity that they are rid of the dark days of old yet the popular ignorance of those days remains about the same again what

latter for daily bread and in danger from the vengeance of the most untiring police in europeis too true to though probabilities of life though in such a case as olgas it would not have been inconceivable that she should have told truth and shamed the devil when first her heart was touched by lesleys affection but the circumstances of though crime at pangbourne most ingeniously complicated almost deprive her of any choice of action when once she has been compromised by the heartless isaakoff that consummate pretender imposing in every sense is nowhere moro true to himself than when he hoists the parkers with their own petard and goes off with his spoil in a state of virtuous indignation leaving his victims penetrated with shame at the shadow of suspicion cast on so gallant a gentleman and his granddaughter with no refuge but the arms of the lover whom she is by what seems force majeure compelled to mystify and deceive the taint of crime will be too overpowering

on ireland of geoffrey keating finished in 1629 and read and transcribed in every irishspeaking part of ireland during the two succeeding centuries is the latest literary summary in irish of the historical tales traces of which are to be found in irish books for many previous centuries leabhar na huidhri an existing manuscript written about the year 1100 shows that many of these tales were prevalent before that date the glossary of cormac the composition of which may be attributed to the tenth century is evidence that in the year 900 they were part of literature the irish manuscript numbered 1395 in the library of st gall carries them back to the eighth century and as they were then part of common knowledge it is easy to believe that they were well known two or three centuries earlier it is therefore a justifiable hypothesis that they were in existence at the time of the introduction of writing into ireland from italy had they when first met with been attributed to any one great author it is probable that some indication of this attribution would have survived such is the nature of the evidence which justifies the belief that these historical tales of the early history of ireland are older j than the fifth century and the introduction of writing into the island how much older they are is unknown but the remote period to which they can be traced and the study of their development and elaboration lead to the conclusion that they were the foundation of irish literature they present considerable variations in detail but are constant in certain particulars thus three races in the same orderthe firbolg the tuatha de danann and the gaedhelare always represented as the successive rulers of ireland each associated with particular topographical features and particular names of illustrious men that all this whatever its origin is to be regarded in its existing form rather as literature than as historical narrative is shown by the fact that it is difficult to trace in the accounts of these races any distinctive linguistic or social characteristics they have tribes and kings and administrators of laws and hereditary artificers resembling those of the irish of the early middle ages and not a single sentence of any speech but irish is j put into their mouths when the gaedhel j or as they are often called the race of miledh are established in the land there are further developments of historical tales a great series of which the centre is the famous tain bo cuailgne relate to the times of king ailill and queen medhb the exploits of cuchulainn and his friends and foes the heroes the character of the adventures and the general style of these tales are uniform another series deal with events in the days of a later king cormac mac airt and of heroines and heroes of his timegraine and finn oisin osgar and caeilte they too have their proper characteristic epithets and are associated also with topographical features in all their adventures these heroes never fall in with those of the time of ailill and medhb and their histories are related in a totally different style from those of cuchulainn and his contemporaries both series are joined on to the period of the introduction of christianity into ireland but in different ways for the survivors of the court of cormac mao airt are represented as talking on earth with st patrick in the agallamh na senorach while in the siabhar carpait cachulainn is called up from hades by st patrick to prove the power of the saint and thus help to overcome the doubts of the pagan king laeghaire the stories of the heroes of king cormac mac airts day are of a higher degree of literary ability and show more true poetry and less mere marvel than those which tell of the reign of ailill and medhb and they are more closely connected with later irish literature such is the scope of the tales of lady gregorys book they are all interesting and most readers will agree with what dr butcher is quoted as saying about a story of cuchulainn  it opened up a great world of beautiful legend which though accounting myself an irishman i had never known at all many of the tales are taken from the silva gadelica of mr standish hayes ogrady it is a pity that some of the other contributing translators and lady gregory herself have not followed his example of translating good irish into equally good eoglish it is a harmless affectation of dr douglas hyde to make believe not to know enough english to translate irish and to prove his irish patriotism by writing broken english prof kuno meyer appears to think that obsolete english words express the meaning of simple irish better than everyday modern words and thus his heroes fare instead of going and reach their steads instead of their homes and employ a wright to work for them instead of a carpenter an eastern proverb says the words of kings are kings of words but lad gregory prefers to use an intentionally illiterate method of expression at the court of the king of tara because in a cottage at kiltartan she heard a sad story of the death of kings so told but the cottager meant to tell the tale in the choicest language he had and he would like to hear a story in english such as goldsmiths rather than in this artificial language a graver fault is that to support an untenable historical hypothesis lady gregory has tampered with the text of some of the tales and left out such great names as those of cormac and of art but these are critical objections to a book which is not meant to be critical and which will do good service by encouraging the reading world to make the acquaintance of irish literature  gods and fighting men the story of the tuatha de ts   1mnaan and of the fianna of ireland arranged and r mt into english by lady gregory with a preface by b yeats murray 6s net mr andrew lang had better look to his laurels as a storyteller lady gregory as a medium for gaelic myth and legend is almost as industrious as the editor of the many coloured fairy books it is but a little while since she began with  poets and dreamers and barely yesterday since she gave us in  cuchulain of muirthemne a whole cycle of gaelic tradition yet already she presents us with this further instalment of irish legendary literature lady gregory is an enthusiast for gaelic learning and we may be sure that it is from a more worthy motive than the mere love of being before the public that she produces these books in such rapid succession but while we are grateful for the results of her devotion to her design of utting into an intelligible english form the traditional iterature of the irish fireside we must warn her of the dangers of overrapid production as it affects both the quality of her own work and the heartiness of the welcome accorded to it certainly she has had much encouragement in such inspiring compliments as that which she records as coming from president roosevelt who after reading her last book  sent for all the other translations from the irish he could get to take with him on his journeys but even so it is better that we should wish for more than that we should get too much it is perhaps ungrateful to welcome thus churlishly a volume of legendary tales which are new to most of us in substance as well as in form and which have so much of the freshness which only extreme antiquity can give but the manner of lady gregorys work leaves something to be desired she tells us that she has  found it more natural to tell the stories in the manner of the thatched houses where she has heard so many legends than in that of the slated houses where she has not heard them but since most of the stories come not from the cottage fireside but from an irish text authenticated by manuscripts in great libraries this is hardly a sufficient justification for the preservation of irish idioms in an otherwise colloquial english version nothing is gained by writing 4it was what sreng said  for  sreng said or  it was nuada was king  for  nuada was king a more serious objection is involved in lady gregorys choice of a title and her substitution of a divine for a historical motif for many of the legends irish legend is vague enough without attempting to represent its historical personages as the divinities of a hypothetical mythology because she has found it impossible to date the legends historically lady gregory has in support of a purely speculative theory 44 left out such names as those of cormac and art and other more or less historical personages in doing so we take leave to think she has robbed the stories of much of their interest half of the charm of unreal things lies in the doubt whether they may not after all be real what should we say to the editor of the

observation yet the tale hangs somewhat loosely together and the reader scarcely cares who wins or who loses the tale is too much set in scenes the action moves too abruptly from point to point the effects are too broad and melodramatic if we were to set down these faults to the artist we should commit a great injustice he was probably not free to choose his method the sculptor who works in marble has an enduring advantage over his rival who moulds in clay we may prefer a lily to a rose but we must not blame the rose for not being white in colour and throwing off the lily scent each must be taken for what it is in like manner we must look at aspen court as a work produced in a particular way we must bear in mind the long pauses in the story and when we see that the curtain is coming

could at times be bitterly hard especially when there was a choice between withholding payment of a just debt and spending the money on some unrighteous pleasure at such a crisis he was proof against any pleadings and took spiteful delight in feeling his sovereigns between bis finger and thumb in his pocket while solemnly swearing to a distressed tradesman that he did not that day know where to turn for five shillings though he should be in ample funds next week   then he went to parishe talked french by the way with a very pure and bold english accent like some of his bettersand as he combined a coupte of tastes which do not harmonise advantageously for the pocket especially in france namely playing high and drinking hard he scarcely could be said to visit the continent for retrenchment at home his rooms in halfmoon street were open to all comers in the days of his prosperity and even when it became expedient to see who knocked as it soon did he still held hospitable orgy for any one who had no claim upon him but it was a queer set that the captain liked to have about hima bad set in facti do not mean on the mere score of its members being remarkably goodfornothinga qualification which would suit some very good sets we all knowbut in point of taste isle liked what is called the artistworld but then he was incapable of comprehending either art or its noble professors and patronised any rattling scampish raurienif foreign so much the betterwho dressed like a guy told profane or immoral anecdotes or both sketched a caricature blew a bugle or

were good enough not to mind at all and indeed rather to like and sometimes to make the evening glided very pleasantly into night and the night into morning and wilmslow was happy contributing his wine his loud laugh and sometimes his bad joke to the happiness of his respectable friends these were not play nights the artists of wilmslows set have not much to lose and if cards came out it was

vicar he stole a knife exchanged the knife for a captured mavis and set the bird free thenceforward to himself he was not the same boy the flight of the mavis had given him kinship with nature the knife formed a piece of circumstantial evidence connecting him with a school scandala scandal of the unmentionable kind which rises over schools now and then like a miasma the kind not referred to in stalky sf co he might have explained the knife but he would not have been believed besides the incident of the mavis was so secret and so holy he is regarded as unfit to mix with other boys and is sent away to a distant school this finishes his connexion with the vicar who was his evil genius delighted in flogging and had an infamous past at the distant school jack protected from bullying and from the same sort of scandal with which his own name was darkened a little musical genius theo half a pole whose mother helen had seen a russian prison and unmentionable horrors helen adopted jack

for all themes are lawful when bandied with dignity and decency as mn voynich hat certainly handled hers it is the continual sentimentality of the story that offends sentimentality at we repeat week by week is the bane of english fiction it always involves a conventional prettiness and it always excludes real imaginative force jack raymond is carefully written but it discloses little observation

far above the general level of the fictitn of today though it is poignantly real at time and written with unvarving ability their complaint wih lrobably be that it ends in a fizzle at least we must doubt if she quite knew what to do with jack after pulling him through his terribly wid boyhood it may be however that her ending is subt skilful suggesting to us that we have not vet done with jack that we had better keel him in mind for he may reappear and compensate us for our anxieties on his behalf if mrs vovnich had been bent on romance she would have made helen miirski train him as a fighter in the great war in which her husband fell and we should have seen him striving agmainst the cruelties and despotism of siberia perhaps she is phrenologically right in her choice of his career but an end that shows him merely baffled his sisters child a victim to the disease he has striven to master and disclosing by his features in death the identity of his father the betrayer of jacks sister with one whom jack has sworn a solemn oath to protect and cherishsuch an end is to the ordinary reader exasperating fyet after all it is the boy not the man that make the book rhe heros childhood is described with a terrible too terrible reality  and it needs all mrs novnichs power to make us forgive the horrors but she has wonderful insight into an illused boys heart and the description of the awakening of his soul in that moment when he let the mavis go free over the moorland is unforgettable  jack raymond by e l voynich by the author of the gadfly in this powerful novel

raymond new novels by e l voynich heine mann character as well as circumstances must be very convincing to make an unmixed tragedy appear the real and inevitable thing it should be the tragedy of jack raymond is not invested with even so much power to compel belief as  the gadfly its predecessor could show the study of bow youths is morbid but the story of  jack raymond  is more morbid than the other indeed it is a strongly written story and it might make readers miserable but for the saving or damning fact that the narrative is not conceived nor expressed in such a manner as to wind its gloomy thread about ones heart  strings once or twice  many readers will see thisone thinks that jac raymond himself and his experiences as well as surroundings are going to be acutely distressing as well as merely disagreeable the impression passes the boy is never sufficiently lifelike to excite and harrow we seem to have read something that a little resembles his early halfsavage halfboyish adventures as the leader of a band of youthful cornish barbarians only the other thing whatever it was brought its hero more home to the reader the most impressive moment in poor raymonds career is just after his great ordeal when morally and physically bruised and broken he in his sullen despair believes no healing possible but hugs his degradation to his crushed and lonely heart his sister does not say much to us and is even less well realized the affronts and misfortunes heaped on their heads are without an iota of the humour that should underlie and help the sense of pity as for the cruel unclothe head ana front of all the offendinghe is a gruesome subject but he is truly a pathological study better suited to figure in a criminal or medical report than in an english novel it

the lawyers daughter tiie lawyers daughter by frank trollope 3 vols london skeet 1873 fc though we learn from the titlepage of  the lawyers daughter that its author has already written no less than four other novels we regret to say that up to the present time so great was our ignorance of contemporary literature that we were wholly unawrare of his existence after reading the lawyers daughter we are by no means sure that we have any great cause for rejoicing at the enlightenment it affords us what is to be said of an author who gravely and without apology introduces his readers to venice in the seventeenth century and to all the paraphernalia of cloaks and swtords masks and daggers which have been the undisputed property of the london journal since the days of monk lewis  there is a melancholy helpless heroism about the action which at once commands our respect and moves our pity how little appreciation of the time in which he lives must an author have to whom the historical novel seems still a fitting vehicle for amusement or instruction we could scarcely have been more surprised at being asked to read a new  grand cyrus or a fresh chronicle of amadis of gaul than at finding an author as yet unknown to fame and we venture to presume young offering to a public that feeds on mudie a story which uses again all the devices and machinations familiar in the days of anne radcliffe or g p r james quite oblivious of the oftenquoted advice of corinna to pindar about sowing with thc hand and not with the whole sack mr trolloxe calmly reproduces in one single work all the stage effects of an entire literary generation bloody tyrants shameful murders vows of vengeance missing documents entrapped maidens duels and combats of six incessant hairbreadth escapes bravoes outlaws monks all these and other familiar machinery are to be found in the lawyers daughter virtue triumphs over vice too in thc end in the famous old fashion but even this attraction will not wtc are afraid ensure to mr trollope a large number of admiring readers were mr trollope a much better writer than he is he could not force the british public to an interest in this sort of thing now elsewhere it is different oeeasionally if georg ebers likes to devote himself to the manufacture of old egyptian and carly christian novels he knows that in scholastic germany he addresses a larg circle of readers who will like him all the better for thc fact that there is no one else living who could combine the ability to tell a good story with such appalling erudition if on the other hand m xavier dc montepin or paul feval likes to drop back a few centuries and to clothe his  hollow puppets  in some more graceful garb than ours  if the eighteenth century delight m amadce achard or the sixteenth ponson du terrail these authors know their pappenheimers and they possess so strongly the art of storytelling that they must always be vivacious and readable  their characters wear well the garments of aa ancient epoch and if they do not differ much from the parisian of today they move about with thc theatrical easo and grace which he can wear so well either before the world or at the bal de it opera but we in england must frankly admit ourselves inferior to france in storytelling to germany in erudition  in other words we want nowadays both the qualities which best excuse the historical novel as well as the willingness to read it our writers of the present day will not take the trouble which is essential to such a work  they will not labour like scott or thackeray or bulwer lytton and they do not produce a  quentin durward an  esmond or even a  last days of pompeii they are not of course to bo blamed for doing the work that suits them best and we should be very sorry to think that england boasted a miss mulbach among her novelists the epoch of the historical novel is as far as we can see passed away in england and  the lawyers daughter is scarcely likely to succeed when  romola  failed yet there is not wanting a certain feeling of pleasure in an age of robertson and jules verne of teacup and saucer and the fairy tales of science in finding some one bold enough to take delight in the good oldfashioned elements of romance and naive enough to hope for a sympathetic and attentive audience one quotation will be enough to give an idea of the work presently as the great beu of the campanella of st mark tolled though midnight hour two tall figures turned the righthand corner of though old wall of st francesco della vifirna muffled in large mantles  and almost aa punctually two other figures also cloaked carno round from though left and both parties met on the platform and saluted each other if not cordially at all events politelyeverything being

assertion should it bo my fate to die i wish you gentlemen to observe should theso be my last words that as i hope for salvation i do most solemnly belie vo the assertion i have made to be most true while the marches spoke there might bo seen a slight degree of nervous agitation in the features of the count de st felix he seemed to press hia lips hard and though hand that held his sword was slightly agitated however as the marchese ended he said in a sharp tone  let us waste no moro of that chaste ladys light pointing to though moon  for in ten minutes she will bo behind though campanile of st mark and our shadows may obstruct us  ten minutes returned the marcheso coldly  will bo quite enough for our purpose  ha say you so then havo at you my lord marchese and though samo instant though swords crossed this sort of thing ought only to make its appearance now in the weekly instalments of some obscure periodical were it as veil written as if it were by the elder dumas himself it would not go down but when it appears in a threevolume novel by an evidently inexperienced writer the anachronism is only too glaringly absurd wc should like to warn mr frank trollope that nobody now cares about old venice or the doge or the council of ten about moonlight squares and sombre streets about mysterious appointments desperate duels and the fierce hates and fiercer loves which charmed our grandfathers and grandmothers neither the melancholy lover nor the wicked baron would be tolerated now for a single instant thc lantern jaws of the one and the buff boots of the other will not meet even with the kindly respect due to their dignified antiquity but only with ribald laughter or unconcealed indifference no one now cares to walk in that imagination street where thackerays j j loved to stray thc street where lovely ladies look from balconies where cavaliers strike mandolins and draw swords and engage where long processions pass and venerable hermits with long beards bless the kneeling people where the rude soldiers swaggering through the place with flags and halberts and fife and dance seize the slim waists of the daughters of the people and bid thc pifferan play to their dancing who cares now for though fate of manfroni the onehanded monk for abellino though bravo of venice  whose eyes moisten now for thaddeus of warsaw or  looking on darkness see with horror

with and are almost equally loved by the same man has often been treated but in the present instance the contrast is not so strongly felt as usual both girls are worthy both are unselfish each seems to wish the other to win it must have given mr black great pain to have to cut the knot if we cannot fully sympathise with him that is owing to the way in which the opening improbability is brought back again at the closeand has an air of bringing down the curtain perhaps mr black would urge in excuse that with an actress for his heroine stage effect is allowable he would add further that his heroines mother was an actress and that what is bred in the bone will never come out in the flesh the episode of annie brunels birth and infancy which serves as a prologue to the story has of course been put in for the bearing it has on this side of her character and makes the transformationscene at the end less abrupt but even this does not reconcile us to it wholly and with all mr blacks skill

forget them now and then and if we enjoy the book most when we do forget them mr black has not set us the example he is consistent throughout and is alike true to what is natural and what is unnatural the faults of the story swell the success of the artist when we dismiss from our minds this aspect of the novel we find that in other respects there is a want of absolute freshness and originality pleasant as the characters are and clearly as they are drawn they are only variations on the old types count schbnstein for instance the man who has made a fortune in business and bought a german title without being able to speak the language is merely new in his surroundings we think mr black ought to do better ought to be able to strike out something new in itself instead of contenting himself with placing things in a new light so too mr anerley the father of the hero is intended to be a likeness of the modern materialist and he is great in the scandal he causes to the clergyman of the parish in the difficult theories he inflicts on womankind in the goodnatured sarcasm which is infused into all his words as naturally as smoke is breathed from between the lips that sustain a pipe mr anerley is capitally drawn and we delight in his paradoxes  only we know him already we made his acquaintance in days when materialism had not yet laid its icy clutch upon him when he still went to church or was kept at home by a slight return of his old complaint when he did not suggest that it was a sign of imperfect development in a scotchman not being born with a macintosh here again we think mr black might have done better we have no such objection to make to his two heroines of the two we prefer dove anerley partly because she is more complete in herself partly because mr black so cruelly sacrifices her the change which is wrought in the character of annie brunel when she conies off the stage and mixes with other people is in some sense significant of her part in the novel we know more of her as an actress than as a woman yet mr black professes to show her to us as a woman and only to tell us what she did as an actress we must take her great artistic powers and success more or less upon trust and if they seem to us exaggerated we have no means of testing mr blacks account of them but the woman is brought nearer to us and we are called upon to judge her from our natural point of view here we confess dove anerley shows to greater advantage though mr black will hardly see it he may not take it as a compliment to be told that his minor characters do him yet more credit but we are far from intending this to be a censure the distinction that may be drawn between his fulllengths and his miniatures is that in the one we miss either novelty or power in the other we are able to do justice to cleverness and observation when mr black sketches the surface of life the daily occurrences when he pictures the retired teabroker acting as country gentleman in kent and still more when the counts foot is on the soil with which he bought his title nothing can be pleasanter the days shooting in the black forest is a perfect scene what with count schonsteins bad german and his general awkwardness what with the fine figure of the tall keeper and will anerleys accident our interest is fully excited and we share the regrets of all the party at the necessity ofa return to england but there are scenes in england which are worthy of being named by the side of this one and english characters by no means inferior to the counts faithful but unintelligible germans all that concerns mr anerley himself is as good as all that concerns count schonstein with the same abatement as to the principal characters and with one grave exception the ruin of the anerleys and mr anerleys last interview with the count are a blot on the novel and the more so that they are alien to the usual bent of mr blacks ability at least no other part of the story can be called poor whatever else may be said against it  in silk attire a novel by william black in three volumes tinley brothers a strange wild story of our own times very subtly told a young marquis marries an actress of great talent and high popularity she does not care to face his noble friends and relations he srinks from introducing her to them so they go abroad avoid english society and settle at thun wheu their only child is four yea old the husband suddenly tyres of his bnient and longs for london life pleads business takes leave of his wife affectionately and hurries away sending his man of business after the lapse of a few weeks to offer her whatever income she may desire she covers her broken heart with a mantle of pride and refuses to accept more money than will suffice to carry her to new york where she resolves to resume her profession for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  those whom god had joined  become utter strangers to each other but after a few years the marquis lying on his deathbed repents of the wrong he has done his wife and makes the only reparation now in his power by bequeathing to her and their daughter the whole of his property his executors who hardly knew of her existence have much difficulty in discovering her abode for her theatrical reputation is not now worldwide as it had been in her early days the old fire had gone out when trouble fell upon her when the lawyer waits upon her to announce her good fortune he is astounded by her renunciation of the proffered wealth he begs her to reconsider her decision urging the advantage to her daughter of being placed in the position of an english lady she replies that her daughter has been brought up in total ignorance of her birth and thinks it best that she should remain so she feels acutely how muuch happier her own life would have been had she never passed beyond the bounds of her profession and desires that her daughter should know nothing of the outer world however she will give her the lawyers address and tell her to apply to him should she ever find herself in distress this introduction to the main story for it is the daughter who is the real heroine is improbable in fact and questionable in taste it seems to us a mistake to have opened the book with it calculated as it is to produce an unfavourable impression on the readers mind it would have been better first to have excited an interest in the wonderful annie brunel and then to have gratified the readers curiosity by accounting in some measure for the strongly developed features of her remarkable character in telling the strange story of her birth and the sad tale of her mothers sufferings and wrongs let the reader open the book at the fourth chapter and he will find the orphan girl in london at the zenith of her fame as an actress her juliet is a complete success and we will venture to say as to our authors conception of the character that it is certain be cannot have seen the part so played we must unfortunately go back l to theatrical traditions for such an impersonation of shakespeares betwitching creation l suddenly there was an extraordinary commotion throughout i the house and a burst of that fine strong thunderous music which artists love to hearand then dove saw advance a girlishlooking creature with a calm somewhat pale and interesting face i and beautiful black hair she was only girlish in the slightness i of her figure there was an artistic completeness in her motions and a selfpossession in her bearing which gave her something of a queenly look she wore a magnificent white satin dress the train of which lay in splendid masses behind her and down over this white and gold fell a black lace veil partly hiding the rich i hair and enclosing the clear beautiful dark face dove was spellbound by that face it somehow suggested italy to her and blue skies and music and the passiona artistic warmth of the south nor was the illusion destroyed by the low chestvoice with which the girl replied to the questions of mother and from that moment dove thought no more of mliss brunel and wills friend 1 she saw only juliet and followed her sad story with an aching heart anl trembling lip during the matchless balconyscene will saw this intense sympathetic emotion growing upon the girl i believe it is con e sidered to be the proper thing for young ladies to be able to turn l round and smile compassionately to each other when the traic sadness on the stage is making the women in the pit sob bitterly and raising great lumps in the throats of the mei it is a pretty accomplishment in its way and may be indicative of other l iualities which these young persons arc accused of possessing doves emotional tendencies had never been educated however  and in this balconyscene as i say size watched the lovers with a painful interest which wrote its varying story every moment on her face the theatre was still as death the scarcelyuttered l tendernessesof juliet were heard ts distinctly as if they had been i breathed into ones ear and the yes of the audience frank in  the trembling lights and shadows ot her girlish passion with an unconscious delight and admiration elie abandonment of her affection the reluctant declaratioirs the coy shrinkings and piteous playful tender apologies were so blcnded as to niakc the n scene an artistic marvel and dove sat laughin maist like to greet as the old scotch song says tnii cd she scarcely knew t whether to laugh or cry with the delightthe absolute delight which this piece of true art gave her and wheti at last juliet had forced herself to the partingtis almost morning i would have thee gonc r and yet no farther than a wart nis bird t who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twist gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty  i when lingeringly and sadly she had withdrawn from the t balcony dove rose suddenly and with a halfchoked sob in her voice sad  oh will i should like so much to see herandxd  kies her she had nearly said but thinking it might be ridiculous she stopped  its against the rules dove said will with a smile  be sides that isnt miss brunel youve been looking at tat s b juliet both are very nice ladies bus they are quite unlike eah other a  a a  just as the curtain fell upon the scene in friar lawrences cell at the end of the second act mr melton conducted dove and will down a tortuous little stone stair into a narrow passage from which they entered into the wings a noisy and prolonged reca1 was thundering throughout the house and miss brunel was being led on to the stage by romeo to receive renewed plaudits when x she returned and passed under the glare of the jets in one of the 3 entrances will went forward to shake hands with her  i have to congratulate you again he said  thank you she said simply there had been a pleased smile of welcome in her eyes when r they met and yet it seemed to him that there was a strange intense expression in her look which was not natural to it once or twice before he had seen her in the same circumstances and invariably this unconscious mesmeric intensity was present in her i eyes he explained it to himself by supposing that the emotional idealism of her assumed character had not quite died out of her i yet then she turned and saw dove standing with mr melton will r begged to introduce his sister and the brief ceremony was sufficiently singular for a moment the dark lambent eyes of miss brunel were fixed upon the fair young girl with a sort of s hesitating lookan inquiring apprehensive look which will never forgot then all at once she frankly extended her band l dove a little frightened approached and shook hands with her  mr anerley has spoken to me about you said annie brunel i and dove was conscious that the darkhaired girl before her knew 3 her secret how singular it was to hear herself addressed in those low rich tones which a few minutes ago were addrcssing romeo in the r moonlight dove almost felt herself enchanted and could have ri believed at that moment that she herself belonged to the old sad e sweet play which seems to contain everything that was ever uttered about mans love and womans devotion e i must go down to my dressingroom now said miss brunel f to dove  will you come with me if you are curious to see r the place  i will send some one round with you to your box afterwards  will saw that dove would like to go so he settled the proposal by telling her not to be in miss brunels way and then he and 0 melton returned to the front of the house i while she is on the stage she ceases to be annie brunel  and becomes for the time the character she represents 3but this heavensent actress is mortal she loses her heart i and as the woman developes the actress dies out she begins to feel a loathing for her profession she has become lselfconscious she sees the people who are staring at her i she resolves to quit the stage and then there comes the ivery serious question how to live it is only as a last resource that she applies to the lawyers whose address her mother had confided to her the reader who has followed her thus far who has rejoiced with her in her professional triumphs who has pitied her misplaced love and felt for her in her distresses will be quite prepared to sympathise with her in her prosperity and admire the true nobility of her character equal even to the severe test of sudden unexpected and almost unimaginable wealth indeed the tale would have been more believable had the property been less enormous the rank of her father rather less exalted the ideal actress is admirably contrasted with the real actress a very pleasant kindhearted little lady a staunch friend in adversity though at times addicted to frivolity the lover is a welldrawn sketch of a thorough englishman very well meaning but rather weak in purpose who being engaged to a very tender sweet girl allows himself to fall desperately in love with the brilliant actress and has not the tact to keep his secret his efforts to bind up the broken heart are very commendable but the great truth that it is a mischief past repair is very forcibly and pathetically told the picture of his family circle is a truthful home scene of english country life and life in london amongst theatrical people is admirably sketched there ale pleasant views upon the rhine with its quaint old cities and majestic breadth of waters ruined towers and vineclad hills and some highly picturesque and characteristic scenes in the black forest where the vulgar millionaire of the tale who persecutes poor annie with his addresses has bought an estate which gives him the title of count his attentions to miss brunel are very far from being so disinterested as he strives to make them appear when he urges his suit with the promise that s she shall walk in silk attire for he happens to know who she really is and has a clear intention of claiming her property if he can only cajole her into becoming his wife the pretensions and the soliloquies of this purseproud retired teabroker are very absurd yet we cannot call the character overdrawn the many touches of his apparent generosity in which a reference to the promotion of one or other of his pet schemes may always be detected are very skilfully thrown in and his notion that all the world is bound to do his bidding and help forward his plans is a clever exemplification of the views of many a prosperous mana persuasicf which has probably aided him in achieving his prosperity we wish the book the success it deserves it possesses much originality it is agreeably written the characters are thoroughly lifelike and carefully thought outcertainly the heroine is almost too good to be true we have spoken of her as an ideal for though such an artiste may not now exist it is an accepted fact that such have been and there certainly is no reason why so perfect an actress should not be as perfect a lady as noble as generous as sensitive as truehearted as lovable as teachable as pure we much prefer the creation of so glorious a being to the representation of a mere ordinary mortal those who are not of our way of thinking may find in dove anerley a young lady more suited to their taste  in silk attirm the three first chapters of this story which form a sort of prologue introduce us to annie napier a distinguished actress who while in the height of her fame is wooed and won and married by harry ormond marquis of knottingley who carries his wife to switzerland dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her or otherwise make her life miserable after living with his wife several years on the shore of a swiss lake during which time a child is born to them harry ormond takes a longing to revisit england which he does leaving behind him both wife and child whom he never again sees arriving in england he thinks it better or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better not to return to his wife any more but to live apart from her the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful marchioness of knottingley declining a separate maintenance which he offers her the marchioness retires to new york where under the name of brunel she once more goes upon the stage to which she also trains her daughter annie brunel whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother at the death of the marquis ten years after his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by  acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property of this however she refuses to avail herself choosing rather to live by her profession and she arranges with the english lawyers that even her daughter who knows nothing of her real rank shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality when she may learn her position and claims thus far the prologue the story then follows the fortunes of annie brunel the young american actress who has captivated the heart of london by the brilliancy of her genius we get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the playthe party consisting of mr melton the manager miss brunel with several other members of the company a number of critics aparvenu count the graf von slchonstein will anerley a friend of the count and others who figure in the tale this is among the first glimpses we get of annie brunelslight in figure and somewhat pale and dark there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features and a stateliness in her gestures which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey they were eyes under those long eyelashes capable of a great sadness and yet they were not sad there seemed to play around the beautiful intellectual face a bright superficial unoonsciou activity and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her for the rest she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists and there ended in a faint line of blue and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it the artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of for she wams an arist one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage  for once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter meltabandonment of her impersonations p on the stage she was no longer mistress of herself her eyes deepened until they were almost black her face was stirred with the white light of peasion and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore when the sudden intensity died down when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres she seemed to have come out of a trance not a trace remained of that ore and those intonations which were the result of uncomsious cration her eyes resumed their serene happy indifference her face its pleased childlike expression swif bive dexterous she was full of all sorts of genial marry activities that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dreamlife she led elsewhere this is annie brunel the actress and unknown to herself marchionese of knottingley holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance some of which soon force themselves into fact for it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever the story of her parentage is known to count von schonstein who has it from his brother a member of the firm which is the depository of the knottingleybrunel romance and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play having met mis brunel before in ia sin atty a novel b wilim bla author of i love or mariage thm vols losdom  tiniey i america he renews his acquaintance with her in england and with the knowledge of her parentage resolves to marry her if he can expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility one can feel of course that the count cannot be the man and as the result proves in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes he fails but the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness but because a better man is bound to succeed and that man as the prophetic instinct perceives can be nobody but will anerley yet one is puzzled at this for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation in the first place there seems no necessity for it then although as annie brunel and will become acquainted they grow to like each other liking is not exactly loving besides she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady a distant relation of his own dove anerley who has been brought up in his own family down at st marykirby in pleasant kent in spite however of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary though one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that somehow the destinies of will anerley and annie brunel are steadily converging towards each other and will finally become one in the mean time there remains the difficulty of dove anerley whose portrait is thus suggested it was one of those rare faoes which tantalise you in the eryact of admiring them there was nothing in it of that mature vigorous definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman but a tender uncertainty a halfsuggested and shrinking loveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features it was not that the girl samed unwell or in any degree fragile but simply that one in looking at her face could not help regretting that her loveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes this is the lady who has been the companion of will anerleys youth whom he loves and to whom he has been spiritually if not formally affianced long before he encounters annie brunel but that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change in physical and mental structure will who is the son of a country gentleman is a thorough englishman and is above treachery and deception he does not deceive and desert dove anerleybe does not even cease to love her but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound inspired by the young actress who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentleminded dove it all seems natural and inevitableand as inevitable too that annie brunel should fall in love with will anerley the two are thrown much together during a trip to count schdnsteins residence in the black forest in germany and on wills return to england dove notices the change in manner and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause yet as if foreboding what the end is to be she hardly resents the change in her lover a change also comes over annie brunel remembering the teaching of her mother she conceals her passion for will feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession and even when their mutual affection is confesed they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of dove anerley whom wim is bound in honour to marry the impossible game of suppression goes on for some time when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress the power of genius seems to die within her in the light of her strong passion the idea of a higher life dawns upon her she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her and leaves it almost penniless if not friendless at this time too the anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodgedan event which will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest worse than this to them is the fact that dove having somehow been smitten with cold is now dying of consumption suddenly in the midst of their wellborne distress fortune shines upon them from an unknown place this is the cause of itmiss brunel having at length been reduced to her last shilling and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer does so and there and then discovers that she is the daughter and ole heiressofthemarquisotknottingley although for a time quite stunned by the revelation annie brumnel soon masters the situation and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the anerleys but dove is dyingend from death there is no escape and she knows it but she sewe eager to get mrried to will before she d joa to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife for this purpose she gets will to buy a wedding ring and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words we two loving each other very dearly write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife and as a pledge of our constant love this however remains qnsigned and meanwhile dove getting gradually worse desires to see annie brunel whom will finds in her poor lodging attired in a simple black dress for her great secret is still undivulged i was going to me dove she said when i heard she had sent for me butis there an thing the matter     dove is ill he said abruptly  ii cannot tell you but she wants you to come andplay a piece of musio for her  neither of them spoke a word all

new novels the privateers by h b marriott watson methuen  co this is a rousing story of adventure in which a stern and long chase by land and sea is carried on with great ingenuity by two americans each pursuing the other in turn in an earlier story mr watson showed uncompromising warfare carried on in a modern english setting but in a mediaeval bloodthirsty spirit without any thought of police interference the theme is similar here though a girl is the treasure a handy man of the english navy intervenes between the americans into whose fortunes he is drawn in the isle of wight and his help first to one then to the other turns the luck of the fray mr watson as usual brings uncommon powers to the study of his pair of american villains whose ultimate motives are clouded for the greater part of the story by a touch of mystery they are not flattering pictures except so far as coolness and good temper are concerned but it must be remembered that they are financiers and finance is not precisely by any account an ennobling and unselfish business the heroine is lightly sketched but attractive desperate escapes and  moving accidents abound but the whole is widely severed from the average story of the kind by the fact that mr watson has always an eye to style and character he belongs in fact to the select body which we once called the  higher sensationalists and of which stevenson is the master  the privateers fiction by h b marriottwatson methuen 6s the american millionaire with his smartness and his tiresome catchwords threatens to become a nuisance in the presentday novel but in mr marriottwatsons story he is the right man in the right place without one or two of them this modern romance in the style of the middle ages would be too farcical for serious consideration here are rival american speculators who wage active war upon each other on the high seas entirely without scruples as far as the reader can understand but obeying some unwritten laws of their own they fight not for the love of a lady but for supremacy in a deal in railways and for possession of sylvia lovells future millions sylvia unconscious of her commercial value is about to be married to alston the first american in the field when she is stolen from her mothers house by his rival and carried on board his yacht swift to the rescue flies alston and kerslake of the navy with a design of his own and the struggle grows fast and furious for the possession of sylvia one of the most illused and also one of the least interesting heroines ever encountered in fiction remembering the charming bevvy of fair ladies nimble of wit quick at fence in  the midsummers day dream the dull and foolish sylvia is a constant source of amazement forcibly abducted held to ransom in an old castle in brittany whence she escapes in night attire with the gallant sailor she is bundled into and out of boats sees men shot and drowned is dragged up the face of a cliff by means of a rope and finally suffers the horrors of shipwreck not to mention a hundred small indignities and all she can find to say to her tormentors is  oh i want to go home  but this is a maris tale a fight to a finish between unscrupulous rivals woman counts only as a valuable asset in their affairs  the privateers  is a lively vigorous piece of work in which the author has allowed his imagination to run riot he is almost too prodigal of sensation there is no lull in the battle no rest from its insistent clamour the story is wellplanned and ably engineered but there is too much of everything if the author had been less generous the reader could follow these extraordinary happenings with equal pleasure and considerably less fatigue,biography_contra

  literature the roots of the mountains by william morris reeves  turner although the characters in mr morriss new romance are set among very archaic surroundings they appear to be essentially of a mediaeval type the men of burgdale are a people of german blood though many of their customs appear to differ from those described in the germania inhabiting a town or thorp in a valley  amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams of a fair land situate apparently somewhere in the southern tyrol the village or little markettown was set in a fortified pass shut in by cliffs and protected by a wall and towers on a knoll near the brow of the cliff the men of old times had built a strong and great watchtower and therefrom the thorp had its name and the whole valley also and it was called burgstead in burgdale there was a space of about fifty acres betwixt the wall and the wandering stream  and therein we are told lay burgstead in a space of  the shape of a swordpummel the houses were all of stone  with much fair and curious carved work of knots and beasts and men round about the doors or whiles a wall of suchlike work all along the housefront the dalesmen were as expert at stonework as their upland neighbours the woodlanders were at carving runes and patterns on their oaken beams the shepherdfolk higher up on the downs lived a ruder life in scattered homesteads and were not very curious in their houses and halls the three folks were united in the bonds of kindred and friendship and formed in fact one rustic state governed by one alderman and meeting in the same folkmote the men of burgdale were great producers of corn and a good red wine which was bought by the foreign merchants they were very successful in goldwashing but the silvermines in the neighbourhoodin silverdale across the mountainshad been seized by a dusky tribe of mongol or hunnish affinities with whose defeat by the dalesmen and their allies the story is principally concerned the men of the dale also sold weapons of such fashions as were used in the westland  and golden cups and chains and fair rings set with mountainblue stones and copper bowls and vessels gilt and parcelgilt and mountainblue for staining the woodlanders brought down woodcarvings and peltries and the shepherds  such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer with the neighbours the marketplace was wherever anyone cared to pitch a booth but we are told that for the most part this was done in the wide street between the gate and the bridge the gradual growth of a commercial town from the trademeetings of countryfolk and foreign chapmen the  nundinae barbarorum of classical description is indicated with great force and precision there is a particularly interesting account of the visit of the men of shadowy yale a murky region into which the wolftribe had been driven by the hunnish savages to the great springmarket at burgstead  gay was the show for the booths were tilted over with painted cloths and the merchants themselves were clad in long gowns of fine cloth scarlet and blue and white and green and blaok with broidered welts of gold and silver and their knaves were gaily attired in short coats of diverse hues with silver rings about their arms and short swords girt to their sides people began to gather about these chapmen at once when they fell to opening their dales and their packs and unloading their wains there had they iron both in pigs and forged scrap and nails steel they had and silver both in ingots and vessel pearls from over sea cinnabar and other colours for staining suoh as were not in the mountains madder from the marshes and purple of the sea and scarlet grain from the holmoaks by its edge and woad from the deep clayey fields of the plain silken thread also from the outer ocean and rare webs of silk and jars of olive oil and fine pottery and scented woods and sugar of the cane the headman of the merchants brings news of a great invasion of dusky men who had overthrown the armies of the cities in the plain and how they had piled up skulls into great hills beside the city gates  and how because of the death and the rapine grass had grown in the kings chambers and the wolves had chased deer in the temples of the gods the prince of the tribe from the murky vale arrives in glorious array with his sister the sunbeam whose courtship by goldmane of burgdale otherwise called faceofgod gives a romantic colour to the story and relieves the readers mind from the gloom of the guerilla war and murders grim and great and the tumult of the long battle in which the felon tribes in rosedale meet their wellearned doom folkright the prince of the wolfrace is a kind of robin hood who only robs a skinflint or occasionally holds a merchant to ransom and it is to be observed that he pays for the purchase of a dagger and a  web of gold and silk as well as a fine for robbery set upon him in the folkmote with the treasure of silver rings wbich his soldiers had taken from their dusky enemies the character of the princess is finely drawn she seems likely at first to be the bringer of strife and misfortune like another helen on the peaceful children of the vale but the threatened evils are fortunately turned full upon the horde of invaders the valiant and beautiful bride who loses her  goldmaned  chieftain is consoled with a new love for folkright and a happy life in the purified halls of silverstead there are plenty of songs interspersed with the story and some of the best are sung by the bride others are sung by an amazonian  bowmay  to the music of woodwonts goodly fiddle and goldmane is called upon for the song of the ford telling how the warriors returned to their cloverfields and meads of mowing grass after a wild battle upon the hills  in haytide through the day newborn across the meads we come our hauberks brush the blossomed corn a furlong short of home another fine poem occurs in the description of a journey to the fotest for mickb that would quarter best for bowstaves the brethren of the house of the face go forth at the aldermans bidding and find the bride waiting for them we have only room for a portion of the description which is noticeable for its extreme simplicity and directness  so came they to the yewwood and the brethren fell to work and the bride with them for she was deft with the axe and strong withal but at midday they rested on the green slope without the yewwood and they ate bread and flesh and onions and apples and drank red wine of the dale and while they were resting the bride sang to them an ancient song of the coming of the murdercarles no man can tell how many they be and the voice of their host as the thunder rolls the men of a little peaceful settlement hear the true story of the coming danger but determine to defend their home against all the world  it was summertide and the month of hay and men and maids must fare afield but we saw the place where the bowstaves lay and the hall was hung with spear and shield  when the moon was high we drank in the hall and they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe and they said come back when the chestnuts fall and the winecarts wend across the hythe  come oft and oer again they said wander your ways but we abide for all the world in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  yea come in arms if ye will they said and despite your host shall we abide for life or death in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  so she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreading wide before her and a robin came nigh from outof a tbornbush and sung his song also the sweet herald of coming winter and the lapwings wheeled about black and white above the meadow by the river sending forth their wheedling pipe as they i hung above the soft turf there is no space to quote the account of the gathering of the host in burgdale the bowmens battle on the edge of silverdale and the onslaught of the men of the steer the bridge and the bull and all the other banners of the united kindreds the reader will find plenty of homeric fighting with the victory inclining always to the right side the felons are massacred and peace returns to the desolated valleys the kindreds became one folk  for better or worse in peace and in war in waning and waxing meeting together in shadowy vale as a holy place when converse and council were needed and so in the words with which the book concludes  no more as now telleth the tale of these kindreds and

priests of progress bv g colimore 6s stanley paul it is no easy matter to write a good novel wdith so urpronmising a theme as antivivisection for its purpose and vet this has been accomplished in priests of progress and with conspicuous success apart from the subjectmatter the story is thoroughly interesting the characterdrawinig is exceedingly well lone and altogether it is a good book on the question of vivisection mr colmore gives us in an apendix chapter and verse for all his charges against that school of surgeons to whom inoculation anl experiment are of chiefest importance frankly opposed to the methods of the vivisectionists and scientific experimentalists  mr colmore has taken every pains to avoid exaggeration or anl misrepresentation of his antagonists he gives us the case for vivisect on and scientific research with the inevi able cruelties these things involve as it is fairly stated by its advocates and he goes to the root of the matter but  priests of progress  is a book to be read and wse do nct want to choke off the lover of good fiction by emphasising too strongly its controversial character humanitarian and provivisectionist and the general reader alike will fins good stuti worthy of the fullest considerationand good entertainment tooin mr colmores remarkabley powerful and thoughtful book  priests of progress cupid and aesculapius by g colmore stanley paul and uo 03j the propagandist who delivers his opinions in the form of a novel the title of which gives no indication of the peculiar nature of its contents crosses the swift river of failure by a narrow plankbridgeif he crosses it at all and needs uncommon wariness to compass the double result of holding the attention of the specialist and at the same time compelling the interest of the ordinary reader to achieve bothto weave a clever lovestory into an investigation of the pros and cons of vivisection as the author of this book has doneis somewhat of a triumph in most works of this description we find that the  characters  are very characterlessmerely puppets in fact into whose lips are put interminable monologues and lengthy diatribes with the natural consequence of ineffable boredom to all those who do not happen to be students of the particular theme under consideration  priests of progress  offers us a pleasant contrast whether the reader be a vivisectionist an antivivisectionist or treads neutral ground he cannot fail to be warmly interested from the very beginning the discussion of medical affairs is hardly congruous with the objects of the academy so we may say impartially that mr colmore shows himself strong on the  anti side without offending by violence of language or imprudence of detail he is graphic certainly  a little too poignant once or twice for our taste  but he does not know how to be dull and dullness is a bite noire not easily avoided in a book of this type the story is that of the love of the hero gale a medical student holding the orthodox creed for the daughter of a noted physician miss  david lowther she is wooed by a man who has already reached fame and won from young gale under a specious promise of wealth whereby she shall be enabled to pursue her artistic proclivities her disillusionment comes years after when unknown to him she is a witness of her husbands operation on a deg there is a scene and she secedes to the other camp of the death of her husband and gales final success in his lasting love for her the latter part of the book tells in a way that leaves little to be desired the dialogues of the students are very fresh and humorous and there are several neat passages which hit off the poorer class of london landlady and her rooms better than pages of detail could do he rang the bell and asked to see mrs crouch mrs crouch came expectant and slightly anxious she hoped it wasnt fleas  but if ever a bed had been disinfected careful that bed on the first floorbut gales first words reassured her  mrs crouch said he with an attempt at indifference  im going to give a teaparty mrs crouch was instantly affable certainly sir how many guests might you be expecting   we shall be i expect six i want everything veryin fact exceedingly nice  which i couldnt allow it otherwise sir  i should like clean curtains up the day before  anything to oblige sir if you dont mind a trifle extry for the washing  not at all anderi wonder if you have any other teacups than the ones you usually give me very nice of course for ordinary wear butim expecting some ladies  have no fear sir said mrs crouch  mr crouch was in service with the aristocracy and when we married me being cook in a county family he received a teaservicedresding  if i can have that ill be quite satisfied  my trousseau was a dozen teaspoons which though my mistress was plain mrs they were solid and i shall be pleased for you to have the loan of them  thank you  said gale  thats splendid  no ladies couldnt drink their tea more refined in their own houses said mrs crouch nor stir it than what theyll do here the quality of good writing as distinct from fine writing is well shown in a paragraph which comes at the climax of the struggle of davidnow mrs cranleychancewith her former convictions  a struggle and a conclusion which involved the certainty that her house would be divided against itself she has a little invalid child vi in vis room she found no consolation for vi was in pain restless and unhappy she was able at last to give some ease to the poor little body to soothe in a measure the strained nerves  and seeing that the child was disposed to dose she went into the next room to stand for a few minutes by an open window outside in the streets she had had a glimpse of hope she longed again to look forth into the night she would find perhaps if not hope courage if not courage calm for as she walked calm had seemed to her to be the evenings special attribute calm it still was but there was movement too and besides the street sounds a low soft pattering a thin rain dropped  a faint wind wandered  the night was full of sighs while we consider that the province of the novel is more to present life or aspects of it impartially than to take sides on any particular question or controversy we can congratulate the author of this book on the skilful way in which he has dealt with a very difficult

quite alone new novels by george augustus sala 3 vols chapman  hall this novel is and will remain one of the curiosities of literature mr sala explains that half the story was written by him before leaving england as the correspondent of a daily paper more than a twelvemonth ago the publication of it was commenced at a later period in all the year round once engaged in america mr sala lost the thread of his narrative and when some hundred and twenty pages short of his goal ceased all remittances of manuscript it became necessary to bring the btory to an end and another hand was called in mr sala after returning to england preferring a close of his own very naturally promises his readers that if they will clear off the fiist edition as here given by the publishers of whom the ms appears to be the property he will write them a new last act we shall be very curious to see it under these circumstances the critic can only write in some sort conjecturally though five sixths of the tale are before him making allowance however for every drawback announced in this confession it would not be easy to name a more unpleasant story by a man whose fertility of invention and vivacity of style are indisputable  than this quite alone is unpleasant from the predominance of odious people to whom it introduces us blunt the heroine lilys father is one of those disgraceful men of pleasure who delight in flinging themselves down headlong ruining every one that touches or trusts themand whose death as it were on a dunghill excites more disgust than pity the diabolical french amazon who is blunts lawful wife their marriage not being the most explicable transaction in the career of one so licentious may be true to reality so far as her sensuality extravagance and ferocity are concerned

when she has been all but tortured into despair by the flinty french schoolmistresses on whose charity she had been thrown are gracefully and tenderly sketched the baronet old enough to be her father another man of profligacy and pleasure redeemed in part by his loving recollections of the child who had once sat on his knee during a greenwich orgy belongs we fear to the genus black swan re pulsive however as are many of the people jost enumerated mr sala nevertheless contrives to make us know them all and when he has finished his story in his own way he will perhaps have brought us to tolerate them a little more for this end we must wait in the mean time we can say that these characters are not the secondhand rascals frail women and devotees whodressed out in tawdry and faded stageclothes by the nathanb of novelliterature figure by the dozen in the bad books of the hour but have a certain vitality of flesh and blood belonging to themselves and their parent those who like excursions into the worst provinces of bohemia which contain their magnates as well as the wretched swarm of folk that tumble for their pleasure may find excitement in  quite alone  quite alone is a franklyexpressed  advertisement mr sala explains how it came to pass that the present novel which originally appeared in weekly portions in a ll the year round and which bears his name as the author was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the year round began the publication of the story without waiting to have  quite alone by george augustus sb three tolumes london chapom hall the whole of the manuscript in their hands mr sala did his best to finish the task he had set himself but failed  page by page he says  like so many drops of blod about two hundred slips of manuscript oozed from me between spring and summer they were written with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and sudden death in the month of august i brose down altogether and the mails went out without any of my tissue paper i had lost the thread of my narrative i had forgotten the very names of my dramatis pcrsowa i was in a new countrya new world among strange scenes and strange people hurrying from place to place badgered and hated always abused often in peril of my life and under all hazard compelled to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed it many steps beyond the outset from first to last the heroinewhose mysterious isolation suggests the title of the novelis the character of whom the reader is permitted to see and know least though it is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year round mr sala invites us to do so in fact promising that if a second edition of the book should be called for he will himself finish it according to his original intention as the story at present stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end clubloungers from the circumstance that she is constantly seen in all places of fashionable resort  quite alone this solitary young woman is the daughter of one francis blunt a roul who has squandered a handsome fortune and taken to pigeoning young spendthrifts as a means of living in splendour her motherwho is the most prominent character in the novelis a frenchwoman who has been waitress and drudge at a country inn boarder at a

lily is by this time is nearly as she herself can tell nineteen years of age and a model of gentleness and goodness though how she comes to represent so exactly the opposite of the distinguishing characteristics of her parents is mr salas secret if indeed he knows it is at this point that he has stopped the concluding portion of the bookwhich as a piece of literary handiwork does infinite credit to the gentleman who gallantly undertook it in the face of inevitable objectionwinds up the story in a manner thlat can hardly have been such as was contemplated by mr sala madamne ernestine is

the algonquin legends of new england b charles g leland sampson low  co when mr leland offers from the mic mac a tale partly in blank verse as far as form goes and in plot a mixture of the french tale of the bears son and the conclusion of the scotch 4 nicht nocht nothing one feels at first as if things were not all as they should be in mic mac this story is styled  the three strong men  pp 311 323 in the narrative comes a sevenheadti devil one of the beings so familiar in slavonic miirchen then the critic turns back to p 207 where mr leland tells him that  this srheaded son  of hymer in the vafthrudnismal reappears as a demon in the passamaquoddy tale of  the three strong men whatever may be the case in passamaquoddy certainly in mic mac the demon is sevenheaded then rises the question why should the seven  headed or sixheaded in passamaquoddy demon be the sixheaded son of hymer of the  vafthrudnismal why indeed  we cannot answer the question though we feel certain that the mic mac story is a compound of two stories which are european though also found more or less in malagasy mr leland himself admits part of this the story consists of a very old indian legend mingled with a european fairy tale drawn through a french canadian source but what part of the tale is very old indian  the original mr leland says  is from beginning to end a song or poem that is why we presume he has rendered so much of it into blank verse printed as prose in the tale the hero loses his memory and forgets his bride when his hand is licked by a black dog this is the celtic idea of the man who was to let no one kiss him and who lost all memory of the past when  kissed  by a dog we fail to see what is indian in the whole tale except perhaps mention of wigwams and the like now if this tale be so notably european though already converted into a kind of chant by the mic macs and if the norse identifications p 207 be so far from convincing to a moderate scepticism the rest of mr lelands collection is also not likely to be accepted without shyness he is perhaps chiefly interested himself in the resemblances between the tricky lox of passamaquoddy and the tricky loki of scandinavian myth the resemblances are often strong but would be stronger if for example mr leland offered p 271 any proof that  the fellow who played the trick a trick very like one of lokiswas lox he says  we may very easily detect the hand of lox the mischiefmaker in this last incident but lox has never been mentioned or hinted at in the tale mr leland may he right but every one must decide for himself as to the plausibility of the conjecture mr leland thinks that a good deal of eddaic lore has filtered through the eskimo to the algonquins and certainly many curious coincidences in eddaic and indian folklore may be accounted for by that hypothesis though we are not yet convinced of its accuracy perhaps for complete proof other examples of indian institutions dress weapons gear of every kind derived from norsemen might be adduced they would certainly strengthen the hypothesis one story which represents  master rabbit as originally the possessor of a long tail will at once suggest  brer babbit did the negroes borrow this incident from the indians or the indians from the negroes or did both invent it separately or did both derive it from a common source  these are questions which it is all but impossible to answer many of the negro rabbit tales have been brought from africa where they were told about a beast not very unlike a rabbit superficially perhaps others have been borrowed from indian sources on all these points it is hard or rather it ought to be impossibleto dogmatize at present we confess that after reading all mr lelands talesvery good tales very well told  we are slightly inclined not to believe in scandinavian influence on the algonquin legends the evidence and inferences are evenly balanced and perhaps it is only the hardness of the mythological heart that resists in any case mr lelands book though we wish he had avoided blank verse is extremely interesting and valuable both in itself and in its probable effects other american collectors of the red mens legends will be encouraged we hope to publish them as literally as possible this is the great point already we knew from schoolcraft and others that the red mens tales resemble and in fact are variants of the european marchen how much of this likeness is due to scandinavian and more recent french and english influences that is precisely the question which at present it is impossible to answer but which many readers of mr lelands book will reply to by voting for an infiltration of the edda only he himself can state his case at sufficient length and with his own evidence so to algonquin legends we send the mythologist no abstract can or should satisfy him,biography_contra

the squires legacy the squires legacy by mary cecil hay author of  old myddeltons money  victor and vanquished c c london  hurst and blackett though first novel by a young writer is like the maiden speech of a new member to which the house is bound to listen with an indulgent ear it is not on the watch to mark what is done amiss  and whatever germs of merit mayr appear will be welcomed as an earnest of better things to come but when though new member rises a second and a third time he must expect to be judged with a stricter impartiality the prestige of novelty is over he has taken his place in the ranks and then if he fails time after time to catch the speakers eye or if having obtained a hearing he has to encounter signs of impatience instead of courteous attention or worse than all to waste his words on empty benches it is but the fair lort uno of war if the squires legacy bad been a first attempt we should have said that it contained much promise for the future for it is not by any means without merit but on turning to the titlepage we lind the author is not unknown to the publicshe bas already written  old myddeltons money  victor and vanquished followed by two ct ceteras this is as decisive as the antecedents of fi prisoner when brought before the police magistrate j thc sentence must in common fairness be proportionate to the number of previous convictions ave are not now dealing with an untried author but with one who has had the training and experience of two or three j earlier stories and wbo cannot therefore present a previously blank sheet to disarm criticism i now there is this peculiarity in the work before us that then is too much plot in it tins is at all events an original fault for most novelists cry out in despair over  thc difficulty of finding any sort of prop on which to hang their fancies and their characters miss mary cecil  hay however has a speciality for plots so that they j crop up on all sides and get entangled one within another therefore whether we admit that the story j is well conceived or not it certainly does possess that j unusual feature o a substratum which so many novels j are without there is so much mystery so many characters and so much complication that it would j have been really kind to have given us a bradshaws guide to the principal stations in the book but thero is not even any heading to the chapters for onr direction we are allowed at the beginning a brief glimpse of the old squire upon wrhose legacy the main foundation of the story rests  but the real hero is his son and heir scot monk ton who is introduced to us as young and handsome and  with hair almost the colour of though old bronze velvet cushions  upon which he is wont to recline as he rehearses his favourite airs on a silver cornet there are marble steps to the door of his house picture galleries containing priceless works of art vast suites of lofty rooms luxurious meals a retinue of many servants and the usual splendour with which a lively imagination can so readily surround us the highbred calm and repose which all this wealth is supposed to engender is one day unpleasantly disturbed by the arrival of one monsieur philippe sourdet a frenchman who asks leave to be allowed to visit the picture gallery bringing a note of introduction from a cousin of the squires scots keen eye detects at a glance that this man is not a gentleman but his  innate courtesy  leads him to show sourdet all his family portraits himself and also to invite him to join the  midday meal  in the diningroom at kingswood which we are told was  a scene of luxury and pomp which caused the frenchman a feeling oddly compounded of both envy and selfgratulation  and minute after minute his manner grew more painfully obsequious while the welltrained servants wondered curiously why this strange man had not been left to lunch alone why indeed  monsieur sourdet professes to hold a family secret which he wishes to sell before revealing it for 10000z and as scot refuses with manly scorn to have any dealings with him he becomes the bete noire of the family in conjunction with a detected poacher who owes the squire a grudge the heros obstinacy is overstrained but the more commonplace characters are pleasantly drawn miss hayr succeeds much better with her wellconducted people than with her villains aunt michal for instance is often rather amusing kenneth the fevered poet and playwriter though an improbable character is interesting sometimes and well conceived whilst the little heroine 1 doris egerton is really very pleasant and natural with her flowers and her two attachments though we must protest against two sets of lovescenes with the same interchange of affectionate epithets from the same heroine to her two successive lovers there is material enough for two or three ordinary novels in these three volumes the first plot gives us the mystery of the frenchman and the family secret the second the story of the real heir to the estate and of his little boy willy who is on the whole very prettily described though quite an impossible child in real wic then there are some country neighbours a mr and miss chamberlain who have also a mystery which does not appear to us to have the slightest bearing upon thc rest of the story but to be thrown in by the wa as an evidence of superfluous force this is surely wanton waste for the author could easily have woven another threevolume novel out of this mere episode there is also a family of leveys who do not seem to have any business at all and are only in the way but whose income house dress habits and conversation are given us from time to time with unflinching perseverance throughout the book in spite however of many drawbacks there are stirring incidents well described a railway accident a storm a fire and very many more miss hay possesses remarkable fertility of invention and crowded and entangled as it is 4 the squires legacy is better worth reading than threefourths of the novels which we arc expected to order the tone of thc book is highminded throughout and however improbable some of the characters may be there is no  trail of the serpent over them all but an artless and genuine belief in the triumph of goodness sooner or later which is refreshing in an age of scepticism,biography_contra
current literature the barbers chair by douglas jerrold london chatto  windusthere is always a certain interest in the first of a large family and therefore it was perhaps worth while to reprint the barbers chair in a collected form because there have been so many attempts since to make current affairs amusing by trying to fancy how uneducated people would talk about them besides douglas jerrold was a really  trenchant writer while there is no evidence that he was capable of any thought too deep or too exact to pass without mutilation into a vulgar dialect short as the papers are the machinery becomes tedious slowgoe threatens to leave the shop too often and the strongminded mrs nutts impresses us with a belief that her creator wished northeast could repeat his first success with mrs caudle the staple of the papers is an attempt to improve the current affairs of 1846 and 1847 with especial reference to the spanish marriages the equestrian statue of the duke of wellington and the potato famine so as to teach the lower classes alternately to pity and despise the upper much of the wit is of the unpleasant sort which depends on a vehement assumption of belief in a religion which the author did not in the least understand in order to disparage its professors or representatives by somewhat captious deductions from a somewhat arbitrary selection of its precepts this is more obtrusive in the hedgehog letters an earlier series which deals largely with the surplice riots and the late bishop of exeter it is every way inferior to the barbers chair though the writing is quite smart enough to offer legitimate attractions to readers with a taste for plebeian pharisaism,biography_contra
an averted marriage by percy white 6s mills  boon mr percy white does not often publish a book of short stories but the quality of  an averted marriage  is so excellent that a critic is very easily tempted to ask why he does so little in this form of literary art the magazines today are filled with short stories but as a rule they are poor weak indecisive short stories and we are certain that their readers would be all the brighter and happier for the services of a recruit of the stamp of the author of  the west end his attitude towards the problems of life is invariably sound tolerant and wholesome and he also possesses that deft touch which can make all the characters concerned in an episode warm palpitating and human without rendering them unpleasantly vocal or aggressive the title  an averted marriage  is not perhaps the best that could have been found for this collectionbut it cannot be denied that the stories themselves exhibit the best side of mlr percy whites literary gifts,biography_contra

there was a feast given in sesenheirn to the whole village for there was a wedding in the course of the same week as the fair and a famous merrymaking it was for days beforehand all the shops in which ribbons and artificial flowers were sold were regularly besieged  for the lads wanted to ride to meet the bridegroom the custom is to assemble at the house of the groomsman where all who can find horses mount and ride to fetch the bridegroom from the neighbouring village the cavalcade ii headed by a btrawman and a leafman that is to say one of them after mounting is enveloped in a sheaf of straw and another in a bundle nf leaves so completely that it seems as though a living wheatsheaf or a movable bush were moving along for even their heads are completely covered with the straw or the

a fair and a wedding to boot to make up for all at length when everybody has danced enough when some have got iiite drunk and others have fought till they are half or wholly dead after the girls have changed their tumbled and dusty clothes the dance of death and resurrection begins lt is executed as follows a tree is planted at one side of a danciiigtloor in the open air and upon it is fixed a burning candle in a lantern the size of which is determined by the will of the groomsman or by the state of the weather in the centre of the dancingfloor stands a table with a few chairs upon it for the musicians all the young men and girls who have taken part in the festivity assemble round the tree where the newly married pair also stand the music strikes up at a signal from the groomsman who dances with the bride they are followed by the bridegroom with the bridesmaid and then by all the other couples in succession the walt tune proper to this occasion is plaintive languishing and quaint at every third turn the dancers change partners that is the man stops leaves his partner and otters his arm to the next following girl while his partner passes on to the young man immediately preceding her only the bridegroom must on no account dance with his bride when her turn comes he makes her a bow and passes on to the nest nor may any one dance faster or slower than tue rest because usually various objects such as watches kerchiefs and the like are the prizes of the couples first in due succession this dance continues under the control of a strongfisted master of the ceremonies until the taper is burnt out the purpose of this dance is that the married couple should now for the last time dance with others the moment the taper goes out the leader cries  dead  the music ceases and the partners bow and curtsy to each other a gallopade strikes up and the bridegroom kisses his partner three times as often as they pass the tree the bride is treated in like manner by her partner after a certain time the tune suddenly changes the biidegrooin embraces bis partner and the bride is embraced by hers and both couples bid each other an eternal farewell and this is to be the last kiss that man or wife are ever to receive from strange lips the kissed pair that is to say the lucky youth who was dancing with the bride and the girl who was waltzing with the bridegroom when the taper went out are attended to their homes by the company and the music  and it frciucntly happens that they really become a pair by marriage in due time this is the dance of death to which i shall have occasion to revert at the close of my tale we must content ourselves with the merrymaking just described the subjectmatter of these stories is less to our taste  and if true to life does not

which it will awaken in a nearer future but why this particular work for this particular treatment the  grey paper and blunt type  of brownings  scrofulous french novel  would be the fitting medium surely just the touch of deliberate sordor to complete the illusion the secret agent is expanded police news done by the acutest mind alive there was a futile attempt upon greenwich observatory one seems to remember with a casabiancad corpse and if you look at the fine portrait in the book you will see that brain at work behind the triangular eyes thinking it all out so logically and so clearly that its realism is exactly lifesize in its dispassionate exactitude or if not dispassionate with only the cold passion of intellectual contempt extraordinarily interesting yes but in a play you need somebody to love or to hate or at least to wonder at and as a written document the secret agent has none of these things the defective boy whom the sister loves and for whom she half sacrifices herselfthis central motiving figure needs conrads descriptive interpretationah how splendidly he could do itor a player of superhuman power to make one care tuppence about his fate a cruder mind could not have resisted the temptation to make the heroine a veritable lily of holywell street instead of an acquiescent and rather calculating young woman conrad must go to the grand guignol and old drury and learn the road to dramatic successfancy doing the assassination offhes as bad as sophocles but quite seriously england is not up to this standard yet and the worst of it is that nothing short of a comedy franfaise cast could begin to do justice to a cumulation effect of tenseness dependent upon perfect character impersonation and the subtlest of reflections and gestures whilst in leaving these to the player the author has omitted the living essence of conrad it is to be hoped that the publisher will do youth or lord jin in this ere perenmnus manner or indeed an entire edition of the works for  the play this time is not  the thing  new novels the secret agent by joseph conrad methuen  co that mr conrad should describe his latest book in a subtitle as  a simple tale  is of itself evidence of the remarkable character of his mind there is reason to believe that he applies this description to  the secret agent in all good faith yet as a fact the book is far more than a simple one even for the expert while for the average reader of novels there is nothing simple about it no good judge is likely to accuse mr conrad of intentional obscurity in any of his fine work but his temperament and mind are remarkable and rare the fact has enriched english fiction during the past decade to the extent of a dozen stories of singular merit it also has carried a penalty for mr conrad the subtlety of his mental processes the keenness of his artistic senses have placed him further away from the great reading publicif infinitely nearer to the select few who have trained faculties of literary appreciationthan many a writer of far less worth for the most part the reviewer finds it impossible to regret this for the reason that the very mental attributes which may hedge mr conrad about with barriers where the crowd is concerned are the qualities which make his work a permanent delight to the few and a real addition to literature but admitting all this as we do we yet find some legitimate ground for regret in the case of this book and of say  nostromo the writer of a  simple tale  ought to show some regard for the simple reader if not in the essentials of his story certainly in the details of its construction mr conrads lordly disregard of such an element as time for instance is a little unkind to the simple reader two leading figures in the book are carrying on a highly interesting conversation a dialogue vital to the story in the midst we are stopped abruptly and treated to twenty pages of retrospective digression before the conversation is resumed again a catastrophe occurs  the lurid horror of the event is pictured for us by a master hand the skill of the writer hurries us on but only as though for his amusement to run our heads suddenly against a blank wall in the dark  now wait there says the author in effect  and i will tell you about a whole lot of things that came before the catastrophe the writers craftsmanship is such that the critical reader excuses such odd construction but what of the good soul who sets out to read for the story alone as many will  in short we think mr conrad apt to be too arbitrary yet in view of the excellence of his work which regarded against a background of average fiction has the quality of a fine diamond lying among shingle we advise the ordinary reader not to be discouraged by this  the secret agent is a tale of life among foreign anarchists in london and deals with a remarkable incident in which a foreign embassy to the court of st jamess deliberately provoked a dynamite outrage through a secret agent of its own by way of furthering its policy in this country it is a masterly study the raw material of which would have been turned into crude melodrama by some writers mr conrad has made it the vehicle for some of the most telling characterization he has accomplished his english is usually so scrupulously true and sound that our attention is drawn by a couple of curiously unfortunate phrases in  the secret agenton p 311  at any rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for him   and on p 315  4i a youngish composer in pass of becoming famous but there is hardly another sentence which is not calculated to charm the reader of discernment  the secret agent bv loseph conrad 6is privatelv printed werner lauriej  dullness is not in mr conrads power and in his stage version of  the secret agent he has presented us with yet another fascinating novel as a play its interest is relative rather than absolute a bad play in short but a good yarn whose proper interest is reinforced by that of seeing a master craftsman tackle a new form in which he is heavily handicapped his books are subtle and leisurely they deal in atmosphere rather than situation very often their narrative is retrospective here in his greater urgency for exposition mr conrad involves himself in a series of duologues which succeed one another couple following couple in a soundproof sequence to the last curtainfall one feels that all his people share michaeliss complaintthey are  not used to seeing many faces at once and the plays jerkiness is emphasised by the introduction of two whole scenes and several characters which are dramatically superfluous all this was almost a foregone conclusion for of all novelists techniques mr conrads is least adaptable to dramatic requirements what is more strange is his departure from credibility one believes instantly in his seafaring men but one cant quite believe in vladimir of the embassy visiting his backstreet agent in the full warpaint of grosvenor square nor in the anarchist professor who strolls about bomb in hand daring the police to arrest him and yet the professor is great fun he and michaelis both quite irrelevant to the plays plot somehow contrive to be its most significant and provocative characters their scenes are more vivid than the rest of the play despite its realistic allusions to the gentleman who is so careless

puppets a workaday philosophy by george forbes macmillan and co 3s 6d net it is stated in the opening chapters that this book is  not a novel and although a dainty little love story shimmers now and again as it weaves its silken way the main threads of the garment as it were consist of what the author is pleased to call a workaday philosophy the puppets in question according to james gordon the philosopher of the story are the human forms which each immortal soul on taking a share in the working of this world has to assumethe intelligence shown by babies when interpreting their sensations so as to mean this world and the fact that they all arrive at the same scheme of a world prove that they have known all about the world before they were born we believe that some such idea as this was put forward by miss marie corelli in her book  boy the reason she gave for it being the faraway look so often to be read in a childs expression be this as it may we cannot say that we are one with our author when he states that  as far as toothache goes i am sure that its terrors are largely due to imagination we wonder has he ever experienced the pain  it is strange also that with such a profound belief in the intercourse of a previous existence with the only one the majority of us know anything about he should not have any faith in telepathy philosophical opinions however give place to ordinary events and the curtain is rung down at the end of the last chapter amid much rejoicing and the peal of weddingbells,biography_contra

publishers he has become one of the saints df the library as well as one of the worlds novelists his canonization is complete  the last honours have been bestowed and his reception into the hierarchy is an accomplished fact he need no longer be read in the blunt type and blurred pages of murphy and chalmers nor in the pale ink and yellow paper of original editions nor in the dogsears and meagre margins and dreadful double columns of popular reissues the greatness now thrust upon him is at once impressive and engaging in his new guise he appears as one of the handsomest and noblest classics in the language with so much to praiseand justly praise it seems ungraceful to condemn the edition has been projected on so opulent a scale and is in certain ways so complete and honourable a success that to find fault with it at all is to run the risk of appearing hypercritical and even unjust on reflection however it is impossible to reject the conclusion that the enterprise is remarkable rather for liberality and enthusiasm than for taste and judgment to begin with the size of the volumes raises objections and objections that are neither to be gainsaid nor despised fielding is before all things else a writer to be studied he wrote for the world at large and he wrote to the end that he might be read and read continually his matter his manner the terms of his philosophy the quality of his ideals the nature of his achievement proclaim him popular like scott like cervantes like shakspeare he claims not merely our acquaintance but an intimate and abiding familiarity he has no special public and to be only on nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his attraction and unworthy of his society he worked not for the boys and girls of an age but for men and women of all time  and both as an artist and as a thinker he commands unending attention and lifelong friendship he is a great inventor an unrivalled craftsman a perfect master of his material his work is the record of a lifetime of varied experience of keen observation of unwearying intellectual endeavour the types he created are vigorous and sound with an intellectual flavour peculiarly their own his novels teem with ripe wisdom and generous conclusions and improving examples he has as mr stephen remarks the undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary society with a force and accuracy not oven rivalled by any other writer not to have studied him is to be without a knowledge of the most important documents of contemporary history it is evident that such a writer is not one to be skimmed and laid aside and that it is doing his admirers doubtful service to present him in any but the handiest of forms now this is exactly what has come to pass in the present edition it is sumptuous but it is unwieldy it is inaccessible without a readingdesk and a library chair to peruse it is to engage in the performance of a literary solemnity we consider it with a respectful admiration and we think with a mixture of envy and regret of the editions of alphonso lemerre and the delightful bouquim produced by jouaust at the librairie des bibliophiles what was wanted was a fielding that could be comfortably held and easily perused and that while an ornament to the shelf would not on occasion have proved impossible to the pocketa fielding with whom the reader might converse at odd hours of the day or night with the affectionate freedom that is his due what has been achieved is a fielding to be superbly bound and gilded honoured with a prominent place in the library and venerated for his appearance a fielding to be revered at a respectful distance like a colossal pharaoh or mr addisons celebrated tragedy of  cato another point on which we regret to find ourselves at variance with the publishers of the new fielding is the illustrations it is at all times difficult to understand why the library edition of a great writer should be held incomplete without pictures and the difficulty is increased tenfold when the great writer enjoys such a position as is henry fieldings in the first place it is not doubtful that if fielding wrote for any class of readers in particular it was for readers who were interested in his work not as a vehicle for illustrations but primarily and essentially as literature and that could we suppose him to have been consulted in the matter he would be mortified to find that after over a hundred years of popularity his novels are held to stand in need of adventitious assistance again tom jones and  jonathan wild and amelia have been classics for many years we know them intimately and we have formed as definite a conception of the appearance of their heroes and heroines as we have of the men and women of shakespeare and cervantes themselves and it is certain that the artist who essays to improve upon our imaginings for us or to thrust them out to make room for imaginings of his own is doomed in advance to failure moreover and this is perhaps the strongest argument of allthere is a gap between the present and that part of the past which it was fieldings lot to represent for us between the convention of today and the convention of a century and a half ago between the age of gladstone and the age of walpole that is for all practical purposes as impassable as styx itself the present is an epoch of sentiment its ideals and ambitions are mainly emotional what it chiefly loves is romance or the affectation of romance passion selfconscious solemnity and a ertain striving after the picturesque in fieldings time there was doubtless a food deal of sentimentality for his geneation delighted not only in western md trunnion and mrs slipslop but in pamela and clarissa and the pathetic lie fevre but for all that it wasat all wents in so far as it was interesting to fielding and in so far as fielding has pictured ita generation that knew nothing f romance and was keenly interested in lommon sense and took a vast deal of honest pleasure in wit and humour and a rather ruculent type of satire it is evident that such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between a past of this sort and such a present as our own must f necessity bo few and small their importance too is greatly diminished when we reflect on the nature and tendency 3f certain among though essential elements of fieldings art and mind the most vigorous and the most individual of these is perhaps his irony the next is that abundant vein of pure intellectual comedy by the presence of which his work is exalted to a place not much inferior to that of such work as the  tartuffe  and the  ecole des femmes these rare and splendid qualities are distinguishing features in the best and soundest part of fieldings work of irony he is probably the greatest english master of pure comedy the intellectual manipulation and transmutation of what is spiritually ridiculous in manners and societyhe is both in narrative and in dialogue the greatest between shakespeare and mr george meredith and with both our sympathy is to say the least of it imperfect in no small degree ave have learned to be sentimental and selfsufficient with rousseau to be romantic and chivalrous with scott to be emotional with dickens to take ourselves seriously with balzac and george eliot there are touches of feeling in our laughter even though the feeling be but spite we have acquired a habit of politenessa tradition of universal consideration and respect and our theory of satire is rounded by the harmless generalities of mr du maurier on the one hand and the malevolent respectability of mr w s gilbert on the other a consequence of all this is that in attempting the illustration of  tom jones and  jonathan wild the modern artist enters on a task for which he is indifferently prepared and in which he can at best achieve but an imperfect success this is what has happened to mr small he is probably as good a draughtsman for wood as the publishers could have selected in picturing the aspects and emotions of his contemporaries he is usually successful he has the true sentiment of black and white his invention is varied his design expressive and sound yet of the forty pictures he has contributed to the new fielding there is hardly one that does not seem inappropriate to his matter and that does not act as a barrier between his author and his authors readers it is not that the illustrations are bad in themselves on the contrary many of them are excellent but they have little or none of fieldings spirit and they are in no sense in harmony with fieldings work in thackeray or in messrs besant and rice in  denis duval or  the chaplain of the fleet they would be well enough in  amelia and  joseph andrews  they appear misplaced and their affect is discomforting they have faults f their own as for instance a certain inlecision in invention which has resulted in the production of two or three westerns half a dozen joneses several jonathan wilds and a strange variety of amelias ind sophias but their chief fault is that they do not illustrate fielding mr small has left his comedy to shift for itself and has endowed him with picturesque and romantic qualities altogether foreign to his art and to the epoch in which it was produced he ignores lady bellaston and miss matthews and mrs ellison  he only shows us col bath as a defeated duellist and sergeant atkinson in though act of saving his masters life to him capt blifil is but a body to be carried upstairs and jones a slim young gentleman to be presented under the influence of violent emotion  he has made nothing of partridge nothing of the ordinary and next to nothing of mr abraham adams and for one picture of lady booby conceived in something of the right spirit he has given us half a dozen of sophia which are merely pretty and clever and accomplished and just as he has suppressed the element of comedy so has he exaggerated the element of incident his picture of joseph andrews stripped and abandoned has the gloom and the terror of a design for  eugeno aram he has drawn us three or four duels as many bouts at fisticuffs and a couple of highway robberies his sketch of jonathan wild picking the counts pocket might illustrate a melodrama in a strand theatre his presentment of booth in prison is like a page from a modern novel in the manner of  oliver twist his designs in one word are suggestive now of a fielding who wrote for the adelphi and now of a fielding who lived at bedford park the impression as may be imagined is peculiar to this may be added that though fairly well engraved they are on the whole ill printed for the reproduction of such trenchant contrasts as those in which mr small indulges such a medium as india paper seems improper it is soft and spongy and it absorbs and spreads the ink so that an impression is often produced of vagueness and indecision it is probable that a better effect might be obtained with ordinary platepaper which is hard and glossy and permits of a great deal of clearness of outline and transparency of darks and shadows for the selection of wood engraving in preference to etching as a means of illustration the projectors of the edition deserve a great deal of praise and we cannot but regret that their venture should be unfortunateas in certain ways it undoubtedly is in addition to all this it must be admitted that the editing of the new fielding is by no means so scholarly as was to be desired the arrangement is entirely arbitrary  the text save that in  amelia a few suppressed passages have been reprinted appears to be mainly that of arthur murphy of annotations and explanations which are absolutely indispensable to a correct and complete understanding of fielding and which judiciously supplied would have gone far to make the edition final there is not one in all the ten volumes that these are defects and grave ones will readily be granted they are blemishes too that were hardly to be looked for in such an elaborate publication as the present to the absence of critical and historical annotations we have just referred  and we shall add no more than that in our opinion it does away with any pretensions to finality the edition might have been supposed to possess scarce less noticeable are the vices of arrangement tom jones 1749 the authors second novel is printed first it is followed immediately by amelia 1751 which was his last and this in its turn is succeeded by joseph andrews 1742 which was his first in though same volume with joseph andrews appears though  journey from this world to the next which first appeared in the second volume of the  miscellanies published in 1743 while the fifth volume is composed of  jonathan wild originally printed as the third volume of the  miscellanies and of fieldings contributions to the champion which appeared in 17391740 two or three years before the sixth volumo contains in the order specified thirtyseven articles from the covent garden journal 1752 against the twentysix reprinted by murphy  the ten numbers of the true patriot 1745 included in murphys edition  the two numbers of the jacobites journal 1748 republished by murphy the philosophical transactions 1743 the essay of the remedy of afflictions the  dialogue between alexander the great and diogenes the cynic the interlude and the essays on  conversation character and nothing 1743 and the  clear state of the case of elizabeth canning and the  case of bosavern penlez which appeared full ten years later the seventh volume opens with the  voyage to lisbon which is a posthumous publication  passes on to the  charge to the middlesex grand jury  and the  inquiry into the causes of the late increase of robbery which date from 1751 and 1753 respectively and after presenting us with the early prefaces to  david simple and the  familiar letters continues with the  translation of the second olynthiac and the  poems included in the  miscellanies in 1743 and concludes with the translation of juvenals sixth satire which is one of fieldings first performances the last three volumes are devoted to the plays and include  very properly  the two pieces first printed among the  miscellanies it is to be noted that the dates of production are not always given and that the editor has very wisely prefaced each play with a statement of the cast where much is wanting one is apt in the nature of things to feel grateful for little of mr stephens introductory essay we can speak in terms of almost unqualified approval it is not so hearty and cheerful as the excellent note on fielding contributed to one of the series of hours in a library it repeats unquestioningly the old old story of the fielding portrait it comments upon lady marys estimate of fielding and horace walpoles malevolent historiette as though the ladys literary weaknesses and walpoles fondness for decorating his gossip had no existence and were not to be taken into the writers calculation and it errs a little in electing to consider its hero according o the canons of modern morality in showing i trifle more interest in the religious inluences that made him what he was than erhaps they deserve and in declining to give i detailed opinion about fieldings relations vith his contemporaries and particularly vith his innumerable posterity but when all is said it remains a piece of singularly good and able work and one of svhich even its author may well be proud lt bears in every sentence the stamp of acute intelligence and great literary tact it is full of wit and humour of excellent criticism and of kindly and generous feeling it abounds in happy phrases and in just and pointed remarks on lifo and literature and morals it may without exaggeration be described as the best and soundest estimate of fielding that has yet appeared in english or in any language whatsoever,biography_contra

the history of a slave tr xi rpi by h h johnstone kegan paul trench  co the happy thought of allowing the native to tell his own tale in his own way if not originally suggested was at all events first worked out in a satisfactory manner by mr churchward in his blackbirding in the south pacific mr churchwards hero john king bruce who draws such a vivid sketch of the horrors of the coolie traffic in the south sea islands finds a worthy rival in mr johnstones herp abu1guwah who paints a no less vivid picture of the horrors of the slavetrade in the dark continent both writers have that personal knowledge of their respective environments and especially that familiarity with the social conditions which are indispensable elements of success in this branch of halfimaginative halfrealistic literature hence both works stand on nearly the same level of excellence in their general treatment of the subject and both are about equally successful in conveying to the reader under a somewhat fanciful form a correct idea of the actual relations in their respective spheres of action where mr johnstone yields the palm to his predecessor is perhaps in the dramatic truth of his personation at least it can scarcely be aid of abu1guwah that either his language or his observations are always quite consistent with the character of an average sudanese negro as when he exclaims what curious people you europeans are you ask so many questions and you want to know so much about things that do not concern you but it should be stated in extenuation that abu1guwah is something more than an average negro for at the time he meets his european interlocutor at tripoli ho has a terrible tale to reveal of his experiences during the many years of his enforced wanderings from his native land near the western seaboard to the mediterranean shores the first thing he clearly remembers was playing as a child with the skull of one of a neighbouring hostile tribe who had been captured and eaten by the young men of his village one of the last events he has to relate is the death of his wife on the verge of the thirsty desert attracted to her destruction by a mirage which she takes to be  the great sea of bornu here in her distraught mind she fancies she sees her mother and the house she used to live in  but after  running a little way she throws up her hands and  falls down in a heap then his companions all runaway slaves like himself perishing of hunger and thirst amid the trackless sands  run up and throw themselves on her and cut her throat and greedily suck her blood presently they fall in with a caravan of fezzan traders bound for murzuk and so escape a lingering death in the sahara at the cost of their freedom the narrator entering the household of a powerful sherif in whose service he ultimately finds his way to tripoli his tale of woes and adventures filling up  the intervening years is skilfully told in such a way as to embody  a realistic sketch of life in the western sudan the impression being heightened by uniform fidelity to the local colouring and by the tact with which many incidents actually witnessed by the author have been interwoven in the general narrative especially characteristic of existence on the borderland between islam and heathendom is the story of our heros capture by a band of ruthless slavehunters who raid his native village spreading havoc throughout the district and wasting life out of all proportion to the number of wretched victims actually carried away into bondage for ever we know from nachtigais account of the state of things prevailing in the region stretching south from lake tsad that the evils of african life are intensified in many parts of this border zone where the aggressive mohammedans are brutalised by daily scenes of plunder and murder and where the pagan populations are reduced to the last stage of degradation compatible with the existence of human society remembering the scenes described by nachtigal among the arboreal inhabitants of kimre wo may well believe that there is no exaggeration in abu1guwahs graphic account of the destruction of his people by the slavehunting fulah and haussa subjects of the sultan of gashka who led him away into captivity  they captured most of the runaway party who had been concerned in the death of their brothers and brought them into the open place where we were lying chained they tied the men to stakes and tree trunks and lopped their limbs off one by one and then beheaded them they ripped up the women and lifting up the children by the feet they swung them round and dashed out their brains on the stone seats in the open square where our elders used to sit under the shade of the big trees while these things were being done a small body of the fulbe were busy burning the town and cutting down the plantations of bananas and setting fire to the dry bush outside the town so that the whole place might be laid bare and afford no hidingplace to such of our people as might have escaped all through that day some in the sun and some in the shade we lay chained together in the open square of our town and so we lay all through the night while the fulbe made big bonfires and roasted our sheep and goats then follows a picture which should be taken to heart by those who speak so complacently of the mildness of domestic slavery throughout mohammedan lands in north africa every happy slave in a moslem household represents at a moderate estimate at least ten lives and an incalculable amount of misery and atrocities  early the next morning they passed in review all of us whom they had captured which i suppose amounted to onehalf of our townspeopleperhaps some five hundred all such as were aged or deformed or weakly were separated from the others and put on one side their chains were taken off and they were told jestingly by the fulbe that they might go where they pleased but when the poor simpletons began to slink off towards the bush the fulbe with shouts of laughter began firing at them with their guns and riding them down on horseback some of the fulbe horsemen would stop for a moment and tie a rope round the ankle of one of these fugitives who had fallen down and fasten the other end of the rope to his stirrup and then ride round and round the square at full gallop till the man he had dragged with him was simply a shapeless mass of blood and bones    all we slaves whom they had selected to take away with them were marched in twos and threes to the river where we were made to wash and drink here several who were mad with grief jumped into the river though they were chained together and tried to swim down the stream but they all sank to the bottom and were seen no more nor does abu1guwah find things quite so pleasant in the households of his moslem masters as might bs supposed from certain roseate descriptions of domestic slavery in sudan and mauritania in one place he gets into trouble over a somewhat romantic love affair is tied to a stake flogged till he faints and left the whole night tied by his wrists to the stake until released towards dawn by his inamorata elsewhere he is lashed with  a greaf whip made of hippopotamus hido whereupon lowering his head ho charges at his master like a bull butting him full in the stomach and avoids a very mauvais quart dheure by making off and enlisting in the army of a neighbouring potentate and so getting tired of this happy slave life after sundry and diverse bloodcurdling adventures he plunges with others into the desert and at last reaches the fezzan frontier under the circumstances above described the horrors of some of the scenes in this part of the work almost exceed the limits of good taste and the detailed account for instance of the sultan of zinders atrocities with the doings of his executioner at the  tree of death might perhaps have been treated somewhat more summarily without much loss to the lesson these things are intended to teach otherwise there is little fault to find with the book on the score of accuracy though the student of arabic may be puzzled to know why the heros name abulquwwat as correctly inscribed under his portrait facing the titlepage should be translated abu1guwah the note at p 140 to the effect that air or airi is the name of the people of azben seems also somewhat misleading air is in fact the berber azben the negro name of this region whose present rulers call themselves kelowi that is people of owi the place whence they migrated to their upland homes in the

altiora peto literature by laurence oliphant 4 parts blackwood  sons ix altiora peto as in piccadilly mr oliphant presents himself to the novelreading world as one made up of equal parts of theosophist and social cynic mystic and man of the world the student of earthly character and manners and the student of divine mysteries he has an abundance of wit great knowledge of men and women and society and as much of though satirical habitthe tendency to attack with laughter and to make unpleasant or improper things ridiculousas any one since lord beaconsfield and to these qualities he adds an interest in the spiritual and a conviction as to its adaptability to purposes of fiction only to be paralleled in the work of professional preachers like dr george mac donald to the unregenerate eye in fact he presents a set of contradictions a confusion of contrasts at once amusing and respectable he appears as a kind of latterday apostle with a patmos of his own somewhere in pall mall and a peculiar wilderness in the very shadow of decimus burtons arch in one chapter the reader recognises him for the founder and editor of the most elegant and scholarly of satirical prints in another for the evangelist of anew a westend messiah he reminds you of blougram and of gigadibs in turn like the bishop he is an adept in balzac  the new edition fifty volumes long and like the literary man lie has long since tested his first plough and studied his last chapter of st john we prefer him as the bishop so to speak  for as it seems to us he is apt as gigadibs to be a trifle vague and transcendental he discourses of society with an ease a grace and an authority which are really admirable in  expounding of mysteries in treating of psychical revolutions and spiritual ambitions and successes he is far less successful in the one part of his tfork he is found to know exactly what to say and exactly how to say it in the other it is clear that if his convictions are complete he has not yet discovered bow completely to express them  that though ho ffiay well have made up his mind as to what he may with propriety declare he is a little ten in to th thi pei uneasy as to the terms and the effects of his declaration they will know what we mean who have read the brilliant and delightful book it has pleased mr oliphant to christen not  stella and mattie as he might

that is said the better altiora is introduced to the reader as the posthumous child of a certain mr peto by a lady now married to her third husband and as the stepdaughter of one grandesella an italian baron a financier of doubtful antecedents and a reputation not at all above suspicion mr peto as she informs her diary  was a profound but eccentric philosopher with a quaint vein of humour of which indeed i am the victim for his dying request to mamma was that if i was a girl i should be called altiorathus making me the subject of a gentle pun that will stick to me till i die or marry about her father she has she says  a great many odd feelings one of which is that in consequence of his having died ere she was born he has been able to exercise an occult influence over mo from the first moment of my existence which would not have been possible had he remained in though flesh that in fact she is pervaded by his essence and that both morally and intellectually his spiritual nature in somo subtle manner is constantly operative within her this is the reason she thinks why she has  so little sympathy with other girls from these she differs enormously   in the first place life does not seem to present them with any problems  they believe everything they are told take everything as it comes see no contradictions anywhere and do not seem haunted by the standing obligation which has been laid upon me to  seek higher things they groveli dont wish to seem uncharitablebut they really do and are content to me life is a perpetual enigma to which no theological system offers a satisfactory solutionagainst the reefs of which all philosophies break into foam and empty bubbles the girl who can write thus at nineteen and who at ten  could have hopelessly puzzled

from being to begin with at once delightful and amusing mr oliphant with a touch of satire that is both just and humane has started by making lier as she fancies in love and in love with ronald

looks the beauideal of a scottish chief i am afraid even if he had not been so very clever and agreeable as he is i should still have liked him on account of his tout ensemble why this mysterious sentiment which i am now experiencing for the first time should dr pend so much upon the accident of external appearance is another puzzle can it be possible that so deep a passion can really have any connexion with clothes and colour or that i should have felt differently towards him in trousers   and these are the terms in which she records the effects of his declaration  he gently but firmly took my hand and pressed it to his lips of course i should h we liked to let him keep it so i snatched it away and suddenly began to tremble very violently this shows how utterly incapable the will is under certain circumstances to control the organism the hatred and contempt i felt for my own body at that moment was indescribable why should it possess a power of humiliating me at a time when all my feminine instincts which i suppose are my noblest made me wish to disguise my real feelings towards him  on the other hand what was there humiliating in allowing him to perceive that i returned his affection i if i was angry with my body for humiliating me i felt equally angry with my soul or whatever though other part of me is for feeling humiliated i got so absorbed in this physiological dilemma that for a moment j forgot all about him and putting down my paintbrushit was my left hand he had kissed i clasped them both together and gazed vacantly out to sea from this pass of emotional bewilderment she goes on to feeling very happy to enjoying herself as one in a group after a famous millais and in the end to experiencing a sense of mortification in the reflection that my conduct

very practical and matter of fact with a ncz retrousse light hair grey eyes and a temper to matchwill not hear of the business altiora of course is deeply wounded but next day macalpine after listening to a statement of his mistresss views in matters spiritual cuts his own throat by observing with a pleased smile that ho and she are both agnostics  ho had no sooner made this remark says altiora  than i felt that all was at an cud between us she refrains it is true from unpocketing her notes for an essay she is writing  on the anomalies of civilised existence as tested by intuitive aspirations in ideal life but she proceeds to argue the point with him though discussion is interrupted by the approach of her stepfather grandesella with an ordsr to pack up an i start for paris that very night and though upshot is that she concludes this first instalment of her diary in such terms as these   so ends the history of my first delusion i wonder whether the experience of my life is t be that it is made up of themwhether tl io satisfaction which most people seem to derive from existence arises from the fact that they live on the surface and dont dig deep enough to find that it is made up of illusions that the financial operations of the baron and mr murkle are haa long become clear to me  that the social ambitions of my mother are is no less evident all the three individuals with whom my life ia moat closely associated are pursuing shadows and they persist in dragging me with them next year i am to be launched upon the society of london and no pains are to be spared to make me a successin other words to make me another illusion  that is what it comes to the only things that seem to me real are poverty sicknesssuffering of all sorts i am strongly inclined to think that if you go deep enough everything else is sham but perhaps that is only because i am young and my experience of life so far has had a tendency to make me morbid there must surely be another side

inseparable from altiora is aunt hannah  rough and racy of speech abounding in good senso and the sweetest humanity  touched with peculiar mysticism gifted with peculiar powers a grotesque for some

general mellay and to completely justify his author in electing to create and uso him how fresh and lifelike they appoar and how brilliantly and strikingly they faro we hardly need to say from mr oliphant as a writer of apostolical romance it is possible as wo have shown to differ pretty vigorously with mr oliphant as an artist in dialogue as a social satirist as a painter of men and manners it is impossible to do other than agree there is his j real strength there is his truo success there are dull passages in  altiora peto  j thero are touches ot extravagance traces of j hurry hints of confusion glimpses of failure  to boot but for all that though book is ono  that everybody will greedily read and j greatly admire lt is to begin with though  outcojio cf a mind of siugulur originality  and independence and of such qualities aa wit and humour as good breeding and good temper as knowledge of the world and command of character as elegance of style and clarity and expressiveness of diction it contains enough to equip a score of ordinary novelists for the production of a 6core of extraordinary novels  alt iota peto by laurence oliphant blackwood piccadilly had just enough of sketchy carelessness and improbability to pass for originality and to lead many people into thinking that the author could do much greater things if he liked how far altiora peto has complicated or dispelled this notion it is impossible to say though it is said to have been favourably received we are therefore the more bound to confess at once that we have found it entirely dull and uninteresting both in detail and as a whole the book is an attempt to expand the highclass scientificphilosophicalducal and nethermost west endsociety sketch into a regular novel this is done by now and then wedging in some fragments of a theatrical plot which before it is well developed feebly takes fire and expires in a tedious smouldering fashion the whole thing is of a clumsiness whereat the veteran ouida will haply smile still worse is the sideplot of the young californian belles one rich and plain the other poor and pretty who on their european campaign change names in order to baffle the affections of the men after a tiresome round of forgery and personation and numerous offers of marriage related in detail it merely ends in their undeceiving their lovers and nothing more comes of this confusion which is indeed so perplexing that the author is forced to adopt the borrowed names in speaking of the ladies adding very often such useful reminders as only of course she was really stella or stella all the time being really mattie this kind of business is more effective in farce than fiction both these damsels are supposed to be very remarkable hightoned specimens of the west they merely impress one as dull chatterers there is also a new england aunt hannah a curious caricature after the dickens modelindeed her portrait in the illustrations reminds one strongly of mrs fs aunt she is apparently gifted with prophetic and other supernatural powers which in due time become useful in bundling the plot together the final windingup and liquidation however proves a protracted business being delayed by a not very startling dynamite episode trivial and usually wearisome conversation makes up most of the book much space is also occupied by the ruminations and excursuses of the heroine on faith morals love heredity and herbert spencer much of them we were forced to skip miss peto herself is a good creation but can hardly be said to be even sketched in as it is all we can safely say about her is that she had a mamma who really was not her mamma at all and that instinct always thwarted her earnest efforts to love her however she loves plenty of men but which she finally marries we forget for in order to multiply proposal scenes seven or eight couples are constantly interchanging their lovers there is the usual fashionable bit of financea count fosco baron and much talk of bubble companies and amalgamations most will prefer to read the city article at first hand after searching diligently and anxiously we really cannot find a single thing to praise in this book unless it be the grammar and spelling and the big print and thick paper but all that is a poor compliment of course one feels that mr oliphant is a practised writer and a man of ability and culture and that there is nothing to reprobate or make game of in his work all the same it is as clear as his print that he has no more idea of what a novel should be than a mummy and that he never can and never will write a novel worth yawning over people may say they like it and so critics may think well to pretend to like it and a good many honest souls we dare say really may like it after their fashion because they love to pore over the holy page that tells of duchesses and right honourables aud they have heardprobably trulythat the author has the entree of the most exclusive dens and constantly sees the lions fed any news from the lionhouse is always welcome and if as here it is of a rambling vague and slipshod sort we take it as it comes and for want of a still more inappropriate name call it kindly satire the author is presumably familiar with london society we are in joyful ignorance thereof but not without some stray lights upon poor human nature generally while therefore we allow that his personages have a certain resemblance to the gentlemen and ladies one meets in the best houses in london mandalay and squashville they are dreadfully unlike anybody one is ever likely to meet in or out of doors anywhere under the sun because they are not mortals but parts and fragmentsa limb or two and an idea or so and the rest only talk mr oliphant may know but he cannot describe his london society as we gather it from his hazy fragments is a society which cannot be for it is a house divided against itself thus we are asked to believe in the very superior firstclass virtue of his young ladies yet these virgins and their virtuous mothers are for ever discussing what is to be done for dear lord sark the most eligible parti of the season this ghastly bore

john manesty the liverpool merchant by they late william maginn lld with illustrations by george cruikshank two vols mortimer there is great cleverness in the first volume and a half of this story the rest we take to be by a different band the opening is remarkably good the satirical touches in the description of liverpool the quiet portraiture of the merchant the group of sanctified hypocrisies that surround him and the solemn background of romantic interest which frowns from the old ruinous castle of wolsterholme are an introduction in most exquisite keeping with what seems to have been the intention of the writer of the novel but the work can hardly be criticised as finished in any part there are good scenes here and there never well connected and the blanks of incidents and characters altogether unfinished will be detected by the most eoreless critic we must quote a part of the sketch of mr manesty 54 mr manesty was about three or four and forty years of or when our narrative

his engagements punctually observed and though in doing business with others who were not so punctual or so solvent as himself he had no scruple to enforce his claims in such manner as the law allows and the court awards yet the very greatness of his transactions precluded him from being in general mixed up with needy or embarrassed parties and his wealth often allowed him to display the semblance and perhaps the reality of generous and kindly dealing towards the fallen or broken adventurer in trade  at five tea followed by an hours indulgence in smoking his only luxury and conscientious scruples occasionally reproached him for indulging in this slaveraised weed brought the merchant again to his books a bread and cheese supper sometimes relieved by a glass of hot rum and water followed and ten oclock consigned him to his bed thence to rise at six oclock the next morning and repeat the labours of the bygone day in reality this staid merchant is a villainous pirate and his enormous fortune is the growth of a series of bloody atrocities on the slave coasts of africa a curious point seems to have been aimed at in the character which we can but guess at now it is left so

i the infinite camcitu the storm of a i genium by cosmo hamilton hurst  blackett many readers will feel that a straitwaistcoat would have been most fitting for a genius with such lack of restraint as the man here pictured not realizing perhaps that there has not yet been invented a spiritual strait  waistcoat that will serve as a deterrent to such irradi cably sensual natures whilst leaving the spiritual force unfettered the present story of the devastation brought about by the genius lacks balance being unrelieved by compensating signs of the real uplifting of any one as a result of his violinplaying and we are thus entitled to question whether his is not such an extreme case as to make him a monstrosity rather than a human being and therefore not of much account as a character study for men and women  the infinite capacity by cosmo hamton hurst and blackett 6s mr cosmo hamilton has presented the reading public with a volume of infinite capacity it is the story of a genius who cannot claim to be a human being except in so far as his genius leads him into monstrous excesses a son of the people he was raised above the people by his genius but in every point except one when his genius slept or was dormant he was not only a son of the people but a son of the worst type of the people the man ai6 commenced his career in obscurity as a member of the orchestra of a low class cafe in paris his genius as a violinist came to be recognised the man who was less than nothing was immediately worshipped as little less than a god huge and extravagant sums were paid for the privilege of admittance to the concerts where he was to perform rich and fashionable women often the most foolish class to be found metaphorically kissed the ground upon which he trod the man himself was wholly indifferent to this worship his fleeting affections were usually bestowed in the lowest quarters of paris such affection as he had to bestow appeared only at intervals and was apt to be rapidly forgotten indeed outside o his art the mans mind was more often than not a blank one day he was entirely oblivious of the actions which he had performed on the preceding day the fact that he found it hard to remember his engagements which had to be carefully noted for him by an absurd little person named zosime was not remarkable as many intellectual men are similarly afflicted the real transition of the story to something more than ordinary occurs when ai6 visits beever park on the invitation of lady elizabeth greenfield who is married to a pompous liberal politician who in consequence of wearing the nonconformist conscience on his coatsleeve has achieved the position of colonial secretary lady elizabeths union with this liberal monstrosity has of course proved uncongenial and at one stage of her career nearly involved a catastrophe the son and pat the daughter were brought up in inevitably uncongenial surroundings their mother was always acting a part and their father spouting platitudes from bhe leaflets of the liberal central office in this unfortunate state of circumstances lady elizabeth fell under the spell of ai6 with the result that she invited him to beever park to take part in a concert to raise funds for a local o4ject a manly young fellow harry steynor had long been in love with pat and had at this very moment put an important question to her which pat had undertaken to answer in a few days the mountebank and his violin appear on the sceneomne ignotum pro magnificopat tired of her mothers acting and her fathers nauseous political allusions is attracted by aie ai6 falls into the convulsions and volcanic eruptions which are natural to genius the girls imagination is conquered and she consents to flight with aie under the mistaken belief that she can be useful to a person who is utterly useless and positively detrimental except when he is playing the fiddle from this point events march somewhat more slowly than could be desired evidently a semiclimax has been reached greatly as i admire the work i should like to see more swiftness from this point up to the climax pat in consenting to run away with ai6 did not fully realise the import and the tendencies of the step which she had taken thoroughly imbued with the uselessness in his political work of her father the colonial secretary she had conceived the notion that it would be a grand thing to do some useful work in the world ai6 told her he needed her she knowing the utterly irresponsible creature that he was fancied that she could be useful to him in his work she entirely misunderstood the situation to be useful to ai6 was zosimes function arrived at paris at the hotel de crillon the man is in transports he engages the best suite in the hotel he rushes out past shopping hours to buy up flowers for all that money will purchase his wife is tired he returns with the flowers his wife has retired and locked the door he pleads through it she tells him she is tired and must rest he raves he stamps he rages he kicks at the door but he receives no other reply he cries out in agony  very good i see i am not to enter heaven i am not to be among the angels very well then tonnerre de dieu i will be a fallen angel with a vengeance to the moulin rouge to hell  ai6 being a genius does nothing by halves and he fully acts up to the part which he has prescribed for himself pat in the meantime fails to realise the situation and it is not until her mother lady elizabeth arrives in paris that she for the first time comes to understand ai6 and his proceedings the remainder of the book admirably clever in dialogue though somewhat delayed in action leads up to the inevitable conclusion two obstacles intervene firstly ai6 is stricken with brain fever and it is only through the presence of pat at his bedside that his life is saved he returns shortly to his former way of living pat left alone is visited by her former lover captain steynor elopement is decided on but again the hand of fate delays the inevitable ai6 motoring with a party of his cafe friends is the victim of a motor accident in which he loses his bow arm the violin is silenced for ever but not the tongue of the gamin vho had risen to greatness pat and zosime have to bear the misery of his blasphemies and reproaches a happy event releases them having gone to live in a provincial town ai6 discovers a boy what that discovery means is told in these words remembering nancine was at one time ai6s little nancine   so this is the boy i found you singing to sleep yes said nancine what a boy he has grown look at his hands feel the bumps behind his ears nancine my little nancine you are the mother of one who will be famous throughout the world think what those hands and those bumps will do with a violin i dont understand it  there was a curious little smile on nancines face at that point we gallop to the end zosime takes the necessary measures to free pat and she becomes the happy spouse of captain steynor the book is extraordinarily clever i hope it will not be too clever for the ordinary reader of novels poetry romance satire and literary grace

forenoon at church and when they took off her nightcapbehold there fell the beautiful golden plaits of hair to the ground with the cap and there the bride sat with her head round as a turnip and with her hair cut short and she was ready to die with laughter to see the consternation of those who saw it and how they could hardly refrain from screaming in horror the bridegroom however laughed with the bride at the joke and they two were a happy couple although she continued many of her peculiarities which were not altogether womanly thus she always wore mens clothes and was fond of manly occupations such as hunting riding turning on a lathe and even occasionally smoking a pipe but with all this the odd little lady was so truly gentle and kind and cheerful that she made everybody happy around her so that everybody cordially liked her and became attached to her uncle herkules went to live with her when he was twelve years old after the death of his parents and was brought up on her estate together with her six sons these young gentlemen lived together in a large parlour called  the lions den and there was merriment and noise enough  still from their very earliest youth they all assembled to family prayers morning and evening the little countess was the very best of mothers to these lads alike prudent nnd kind and nothing pleased her better than to get up a hunting party or some sort of amusement which would entertain them they were at the same time happy and merry young men and never thought of doing anything which was wicked or unjust as a widow she lived splendidly on

was looked up to nnd beloved by lier children and her dependents and was always called by the latter  sir countess she loved hunting and fishing even to her old age and when she was seventy years old shot a roebuck in her own park among her household she was always cheerful and kind and amused herself greatly by giving them riddles to guess in particular to one of her women who always forgot the solution of the riddle  who gave thc first kiss in rome was one of her most frequentlyrepeated riddles and the answer that she returned always was  oh  how should i knowit was perhaps the pope and

the vicar of bu 11 hampton by anthony trollope bradbury evans  co mel tbollope continues to be an industrious and prolific author but in the present instance he has deserted to some extent the path he usually follows in the wellchosen words which he has prefixed to this novel he gives tw to understand the point of view from which he would desire to be criticized he has made an attempt to direct public attention with all delicacy consistent with the subject to the miseries in which an unhappily large class of our fellow creatures are involved and asks for the public sympathy with them on though uphill path of their return to virtue  i have introduced says he  the character of a girl whom i will call for want of a truer word that shall not in its truth be offensivea castaway i have endeavoured to endow her with qualities that may create sympathy and i have brought her back at last from degradation at least to decency this purpose has perhaps been carried out with as much success as could have been expected though as the author has not unnaturally shunned the history of carrie brattles fall it is difficult to estimate the amount of merit in her subsequent reformation that she is pretty and affectionate is nearly all we know of her we see that she is harshly regarded by many selfish relatives but whether the hardness of her father or the tenderness of frank fenwick the clergyman has more of true love in it it is hard to say or whether the justice of the one is less admirable than the mercy of the other that mercy prevails over justice in the end we are glad to learn but in the long antagonism between the two exponents of these qualities the hard old miller jacob brattle on the one side and the impulsive and rather selfabsorbed vicar on the other our own sympathies are not altogether enlisted on the side mr trollope would desire both characters are admirably drawn though neither rises at all above the level of common life but so much anxiety is displayed to make the vicar not too angelic that he provokes one occasionally by the narrowness of his nature like most philanthropists of the age notably those who correspond with the home secretary on behalf of their proteges he can sympathise only with the sufferings of those whose sufferings are selfinflicted and while most laudably desirous of raising and comforting the fallen is absolutely incapable of considering the keener pangs endured by those whose lifes struggle it is to stand upright we trace a similar spirit in other relations of his life aided and abetted by his wife a feminine edition and a pretty one of himself he makes it his business to force on a match between an old friend of his own who proves himself an utterly selfish lover with a young lady of his wifes acquaintance who though exquisitely womanly at heart has a strength of character which he cannot appreciate because its harsher side is turned towards his friend in a long warfare on parochial matters with a foolish old nobleman whose silly arrogance is only redeemed by a chivalric readiness to admit his mistakes when proved our vicar is again quite incapable of tolerating any pride but his own and our admiration of his conduct as to sam brattle though there the better side of his character ia well exhibited is much modified when we learn from the miller that his foolish patronage of the lively boy has done much to unsettle the character of the man the other dramatis persona are all well drawn though of course we have seen some of them before there are some trollopean lawyers and clergymen one thorough old gentlewoman and the millers wife one of natures ladies lord st george a nineteenthcentury improvement on his father the marquis a dissenting preacher of a type which is we hope uncommon and a gallant captain who rescues mary lowther from a marriage with the vicars importunate friend and so gives the story an orthodox conclusion on the whole mr trollope deserves our gratitude both for his story and his moral though we must protest against any confusion between the selfish fears of those who are harsh to their  unfortunate  relations and an honest pride of race which is not too common and which in the absence of a wider christianity does much to maintain the purity of english families,biography_contra
st ives being the adventures of a frenth prisoner in england by robert louis stevenson heinemann tnis is a rattling touchandgo tale of adventure of a somewhat ordinary type yet relieved by some fine but slight studies in characterization that it will not add to stevensons reputation is clear from this description as well as from his own doubts about the book already published to the world in the  vailima letters whether it was altogether wise of his executors to publish it admits of some doubt yet after all it will not lower if it will not enhance his reputation and it is of course far above the average trade novels that pour forth in such increasing floods from the press perhaps the most remarkable and significant thing about the book is the skill with which mr quiller couch has supplied the last bu chapters which both in style and briskness of treatment bear an astonishing resemblance to the preceding thirty it was a dangerous and difficult task that mr quiller couch undertook and to some it might seem of disputable taste but he has come out of the ordeal triumphantly and for once a patch has proved to be not altogether a botch take for example the following passage in which the hero is forced for a purpose to simulate drunkenness  doubtless by my uncovered head and gala dress he judged me an allnight revellera strayed bacchanal fooling in the morrows eye prompt upon the inference came inspiration i must win to the centre of the crowd and a crowd is invariably indulgent to a drunkard i hung out the glaring signboard of crapulous glee lurching hiccoughing jostling apologising to all and sundry with spacious incoherence i plunged my way through the sightseers and they gave me passage with all the good humour in life this has the true stevensonian accent the unexpected adjectives the double accusatives the metaphoric signboard all are just in stevensons style as for the matter of the supernumerary chapters they appear to have been supplied from the memory of mrs strong stevensons amanuensis and their episodical character is merely on a par with the rest of the work the tale as its subtitle indicates tells the story of the adventures of a french prisoner in england and scotland just before napoleons first downfall but the viscount anne de st yves de keroual the french prisoner in question is of somewhat curious upbringing he had had an english nurse and ample opportunities of learning english which he talked with scarcely perceptible accent but the training in english seems to have gone somewhat deeper that the mere language for it is only occasionally throughout the book that he remembers that he is a frenchman and a french soldier to boot and altogether he is by no means convincing in his title rdle he is a dandy and is curious in waistcoats yet there is something raffish about his bearing a quality which he shares with his cousin the elder viscount de st yves who is the rather pinchbeck villain of the story altogether it is difficult to believe that a hero such as this could have won the heart of a highspirited scotch girl after two or three interviews the fact is this book bears the mark of a fggel aiinl on almost every page of it it is largely reminiscent of other works of the same writer the interview which the heroines brother has with the hero resembles closely a scene in  beau austin the escape from edinburgh castle has its counterpart in a similar escape in  the black arrow the villain viscount is a faint copy of the master of ballantrae the counting up of the treasure recalls the last pages of treasure island the fight with the drovers is a similar incident to the attack by clunys men in kidnapped rowleys flageolet takes the place of the penny whistle of the carrier in  the wrong box while the friendly relations of the hero with that burly villain burchell fenn had previous existence in the pages of  the wrecker and so throughout the majority of incidents recall similar passages in stevensons earlier books and prove that while be was occupied in writing st ives his mind had lost its power of fresh combination that the loss was only temporary that vigorous fragment  weir of hermiston is more than sufficient proof little fresh as are the incidents they are even less well considered and connected the story is practically of an escaped military prisoner who travels from edinburgh to his uncles place in the south and then returns to the northern capital the motive for the return is supposed to be an invincible desire to see the loved one but the coxcomb tone in which the fair one is wooed does not make this return at risk of death any the more probable stevenson may possibly have felt this as he props up the motive with a somewhat trumpery charge of assault in which others might be implicated for the heros sake but even this is only brought in as an afterthought for it could not have been made the principal motive or else the attractive power of love would have been so much diminished when st ives gets to edinburgh again where he is wanted for an alleged murder really the result of a duel he naturally falls into great dangers from which he ultimately escapes by the most mechanical of methods a casual balloon that wafts him away to the bristol channel altogether the book regarded from the point of view of plot is a panorama of improbabilities nor on the character side is there much to attract we have already referred to though unconvincing nature of the heros position as an angloscotch frenchman the heroine is somewhat of a lay figure more care has been taken with the villain but he is after all merely a lath that is not even painted to look like iron and in the relations of the hero either to heroine or villain there is nothing inevitable nothing that could not be otherwise yet unsatisfactory as the book is both in construction and characterization it has an interest of its own to the student of stevensons art previous to this book his studies in characterization were somewhat forced and he had clearly to content himself with but a few figures on the stage he characterised with deeficulty but here at last he began to show himself a compeer of the masters in that quality in which they specially proved their mastery what distinguishes fielding scott dickens thackeray and even charles read to a certain extent is the ease and fecundity with which they create minor characters it is possible they crowd their canvases too much but the total result is to produce that effect of bustling life which it is the peculiar function of the novelist to reproduce here in  st ives stevenson for the first time came to his own in this respect it is crowded with subordinate figures the majority of them alive and some of them uproariously kicking there is major chevenix the heros rival a dry stick but a gentlemanly the heroines aunt miss gilchrist is crabbed and caustic but goodnatured at bottom rowley the boy valet is scarcely the success that the pains devoted to him would warrant but he is certainly alive one of the minor characters a french colonel who had broken parole in order to reach the deathbed of his only daughter sounds a note of almost tragic intensity but whether it be a postboy demanding blackmail or a runaway bride who is sorry she has run away or an attorneys clerk who has touches of patriotism or an edinburgh buck who is professor of nonsense in an imaginary universitywhether they are portrayed in fewor in many linesalmost every character introduced has the tang of individuality stevenson must have felt some of this increased capacity himself for he has been so greatly daring as to introduce as one of his minor characters no less a person than walter scott himself the passage in which he appears is short and slight but may be here quoted as an instance of perhaps the most characteristic thing about  st ives the evidence it gives of the capacity of indicating character by a few traits   our encounter was of a tall stoutish elderly gentleman a little grizzled and of a rugged but cheerful and engaging countenance he sat on a hill pony wrapped in a plaid over his green coat and was accompanied by a horsewoman his daughter a young lady of the most charming appearance they overtook us on a stretch of heath reined up as they came alongside and accompanied us for perhaps a quarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the hillsides to our left great was my amazement to find the unconquerable mr sim thaw immediately on the accost of this strange gentleman who hailed him with a ready familiarity proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of droving and the prices of cattle and did not disdain to take a pinch from the inevitable rams horn presently i was aware that the strangers eye was directed on myself  and there ensued a conversation some of which i could not help overhearing at the time and the rest i have pieced together more or less plausibly from the report of sim   surely that must be an amateur drover ye have gotten there the gentleman seems to have asked sim replied 1 was a young gentleman that had a reason of his own to travel privately well well ye must tell me nothing of that i am in the law you know and tace is the latin fora candle answered the gentleman  but i hope its nothing bad sim told him it was no more than debt   oh lord if that be all  cried the gentleman  and turning to myself  well sir he added i understand you are taking a tramp through our forest here for the pleasure of the thing i  why yes sir said i  and i must say i am very well entertained   i envy you said he i have jogged many miles of it myself when i was younger my youth lies buried about here under every heatherbush like the soul of the licentiate lucius but you should have a guide the pleasure of this country is much in the legends which grow as plentiful as blackberries and directing my attention to a little fragment of a broken wall no greater than a tombstone he told me for an example a story of its earlier inhabitants presently after giving us a cigar apiece scott bade us farewell and disappeared with his daughter over the hills and when i applied to sim for information his answer of  the shirra man  abode kens the shirra  told me unfortunately nothing the incident is slight enough in all conscience but every touch tells and the whole impression is one of life it is perhaps worth while mentioning that the word cigar is here spelled otherwise than in the rest of the book where it has the old spelling segar there are also some anachronisms of fact and tone and what is probably a misprint on p 92  usuriousness for uxoriousness these discrepancies would doubtless have been removed if stevenson had lived to revise the proofs but no amount of revision could have made up for the want of cohesion in the plot the inefficient colouring of the chief characters it is needless to say that in speaking in these somewhat slighting terms of  st ives wear judging it by a high standard whether destined to be classic or no there is no doubt that stevensons work stands out markedly from the ruck of machinemade fiction and this very book with all its faults shows that he was slowly maturing to a mastery of his art which might have raised him to an equality with the greatest of the past,biography_contra

  his natural life his natural life by marcus clarke london bentley and son  those of us who have been in newgate as artemus ward said may possibly tingle with a sinister glee of remembered horror as they pass from abuse to abomination recorded in this book but in its own words  no ordinary men leading ordinary lives can form any notion of such a life as this hideous with realistic ghastlinessesnauseous with detail of barbaric torturings scarcely relieved by any touch of tenderness it reiterates a nightmare of iniquities to the end the deportation of convicts to tasmania and elsewhere from these islands has happily ceased the abuses of that obsolete system are contained in minutes and bluebooks of which a tempting array is given at the end of the story it is ostensibly to prevent the extremely improbable return of a similar failure that an extract of all its choicest outrages is here served np as a threevolumed novel it is a work of much power but more horror the hero condemned for a robbery which he did not commit and on which he is heroically silent to conceal his fathers crime and his mothers shame for twenty years suffers unspeakable agonies as a convict is always escaping is always thrown back into a deeper abyss has always some fresh ingenuity of physical or moral torment invented for his benefit then thrown in for divertissement we have a rechauffee of the tichborne conspiracy an incipient adultery floggings to death sundry suicides for very loathing of life and hero and there a climax of cannibalism the story opens with a passion which culminates in the family tragedy and though invective by the way is powerful throughout the defoelike minuteness of the genealogy is surely unnecessary though scenes on board though convictship aro drawn with a strong hand but how is the authors purpose or how is the development of his characters served by his detailed descrip tion of two mutinies  they would have been more at home in some book of hairbreadth stories for boys so too of his homeric single combats and his description of  the bestial boohoo kept up between decks and the hideous phantasmagoria in the evilswelling twilight and the hideous commonwealth whose only order of nobility is the halter all this is very vivid and is held up for our execration and very justly too but after all why kick a dead dog  from the convictship the llydaspes is seen on fire it explodes and in it is supposed to perish richard devine the preconvict name of rufus dawes the hero for such a belief dawes to conceal his sacrifice had created in a letter to his mother he and his bastard halfbrother john rex dawes by the way is a bastard too and does not know of his relationship to rex and frere his cousin an officer are all of course on board the convict ship and all ignorant of each others personality and we find them together again and again still always thrown together as the sufferer and the plotter and the bully after some years of agony at macquarie harboura cheerful place bounded by foetid exhalations and the seaand when the settlement is being moved elsewhere there is another mutiny which is this time successful frere and the wife and daughter of captain vickers and one or two others are landed by the convicts and left to starve but dawes who had previously been exiled to a desert rock for insubordination and had drowned himself once but rescued by an accidental log had wandered away in search of settlements till death had stared him in the facereturning in despair to  hells gates finds the convicts gone but the outcasts starving and he builds them a marvellous coracle of goatskins stretched over logs having caught his goats with springs and salt and what wronder  for  he could fell trees without an axe bake bread without an oven and build a waterproof hut without bricks or mortar and so he becomes their preserver and even the bully frere yields a surly deference to genius and after ten days at sea and of course just as the cruse of oil is on the point of failing they are picked up and frere gives up daws as a runaway and himself usurps the credit of their preservation and mrs vickers dies and on sylvia the child a blank forgetfulness of just that crisis falls and the other two men who might have told had killed each other and so daws is not believed but his last state becomes worse than the first then as the years go round sylvia is married to her supposed preserver frere from gratitude and not for love and ho and she and daws are always being brought fruitlessly into contact and frere is always breaking dawes spirit or someones spirit by fifty or a hundred lashes administered to daws or by dawes with details of weals and groans after the original horror in  uncle toms cabin and so on till the blood boils ten convicts wander off and ultimately eat each other and that for several pages north a drunken parson but a very good fellow appears on the scene as a friend of daws and sylvia but he ends by running off with the latter to sea only that dawes by changing clothes with him forestalls him and so in universal shipwreck the curtain falls meanwhile john rex who had escaped had imposed on the heros mother by his likeness to her son and had lived in splendour till after betraying himself he only survives as an idiot it is a sickening and desolate story all thc crimes of a system are crowded on to the head of one innocent man just as a missionary magazine will concentrate with pentecostal plenty all the concessions effected by the finance of twenty years into a pennyworth plum of touching narrative the plea for the book is that these effete abuses are in fact in course of reconstruction in new caledonia  and no doubt for we have chapter and verse all its horrors are authentic but why send them round in three volumes and in un elegant cover to startle boardingschool young ladies and fire the molluscous imagination of novel readers with auttsdafv on paper and all the tortures of nero  those who sup on horrors know where to go and those who take any useful interest in convicts are more likely to be reached by other means than these the author of his natural life might write a capital book of adventure byfield and flood  or he might acquaint himself with the latest accounts of khiva and tashkend and expand in narrative veracious and vamberesque or he might outboucicault melodramatic tragedy orand herein is another bone to be picked with himlie might write a really good novel of character drawing for his incidents on ordinary life and avoiding the ghastly and the curdling improbabilities  escapes in bluefire down a bottomless precipice unravelable family mysteries a finale only attainable by a universal massacre ti la hamlet are the stock tools of ordinary sensational novelists the author of  his natural life shows us by hints and glimpses that he is capable of better things hia characters though their development is overcrowded with incident contain elements of a power that would well repay practice dawes a brutalised prometheus is simply an incarnation of suffering  but frere the goth who develops by unrestrained exercise of power into the ruthless tyrant and who slowly but surely chokes his springs of good is a character touched in the description by many delicate suggestions he is as it were a teutonic and ruffianly tito his patronising air with the child sylvia and his blank incomprehension of her when she is his wife and his clumsy passion for such unwonted purity are all finely touched sarah parfoy the wife of john rex and mistress of frere is a hard and unwholesome subject but truthfully drawn  she was the sort of girl of whom women say it is a pity she has no mother and men it is a pity she does not get a husband and who say to themselves when shall i have a lover   mr meekin as the apotheosis of a canting parson is perhaps overdrawn  but in the description of north the drunkard there is a vivid power and the crown of the story is sylvia delightful as a queer and irrepressible child and well if far too slightly touched as a loving and unsatisfied woman her childish sayings are many and all good though drawing a little too much on the belief of a reader with average experience of children  will danny wear his yellow jacket in heaven or go as a free man   and it is the one touching trait in the martyr dawes when through all his misery he worships the memory of the child whom he believes to be dead we shall look for another work of the same author either on gorillahunting and maneating or a pleasant and wellelaborated study of character he has it in his power to give us either but we should like to know which it is to be the present story is neither nor is it both,biography_contra
