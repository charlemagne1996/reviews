B4884,"['2468144', '8499786', '4382245', '8752783']",  tue bsanileghs of bishops folly by ciiailes leviu 3 vols smith elder  co it is difficult to recognise the author of  charles omalley  or h ariy lorrequer  in the thoughtful and slightly cynical novelist whose latest task has been to exhibit the humours and extravagances of his countrymen when they have thrown off home restraints and associations and have attempted to lead the life of continental cities there are few instances on record of a change of style subject aim and method so complete as mr levers literary career affords the future course of most novelists is to a certain extent adumbrated in their early works waverley is the legitimate precursor of quentin durward   the american notes of  dombey   vanity fair of 1 the newcoxnes  and adam bode of  felix iholt with mr lever how ever each succeeding work gave up something of the past replacing it with new and altogether different matter until like old port kept in the wood the now wiuo added to supply the less by evaporation so changed the nature of the whole that the original vintage was unrecognisable a certain recklessness of style and workmanship and a total absence of dulness are all that mr levers late writings possess in common with their predecessors the bramleighs of bishops folly is one of the plcasantest of them its story is at once slight and involved there is very little of it and that little is illconceived and clumsily executed but many of the characters are admirable and the dialogue is always sparkling and amusing and at times brimful of wit the cardinal fault in the work is a fault that runs through all mr levers later productions it is a species of dilettanteism mr lever writes like a man who knows all about art and is sufficiently master of it to treat it at his will with attention or neglect he writes to please himself and is rather annoyingly careless about what the reader may think he seems to say for i will for no mans pleasure change one syllable or measure hence although we have scenes of great beauty and animation painted with the hand of a master they are followed by others in which the work is blurred and smeared the bramleighs are a family of wealthy parvenus who though the head of the house colonel bramleigh has married the daughter of an earl have never been able to take the position in society that many of them covet they are divided into three camps lady augusta bramleigh who has avowedly married for money lives in rome and keeps her life and her interests distinctly separated from those of any other member of the family colonel bramleigh resolved on passing the magic barrier that separates limn from the gentry is supported by his daughter marion and his second son temple a budding diplomatist the third camp is composed of the eldest son augustus the youngest son jack a sailor and a daughter nellie these last are honourable straight forward people whose only ends in life are to i live and let live  and  love and let love a claimant for the bramleigh estates appears in the shape of a young frenchman who signs himself the count pracontal do bramleigh his introduction and the very respectable claim he is able to advance serve to bring to light the characters of the various members of the family marion who has married an old diplomatist viscount culduff and temple treat him as an impostor colonel bramleigh fights him resolutely by fair means or foul until excitement brings on death by apoplexy augustus jack and nellie who compose what may be called the peace party resign occupation of the estates and depend upon their own exertions for support until the question of proprietorship shall be settled lady augusta arranges to retain her interest in the estate by marrying the frenchman should his attempt prove successful accident reveals documents proving the claim to be unfounded the claimant disappears the whole family is restored to its rights and the story ends nothing simpler or less interesting can well be conceived much unnecessary confusion and mystery attend the claims of pracontal and the way in which evidence to upset them is obtained is roundabout and ludicrously improbable nothing can be less artistic than the manner in which the various characters are deatched to the remote spot at which the inmatidu thoy 3ir nmay be obned nor than that in

his own creation culduff is not in any sense so foolish or contemptible a character as he is represented his behaviour on one occasion shows him to be no fool and on a second to be really what by

excelled himself in this capital novel which possesses the merit of a carefully planned plot the mystery of which is so artfully contrived that the reader does not suspect the very simple and natural solution until it is unfolded to him combined with a group of thoroughly original personages who play their several parts with lifelike dignity and grace with charming naivet6 and sweetness or with refined craft and cunning we have the satisfaction of feeling throughout that the work is in the hands of a master and that all the representations are of the first order he is particularly happy with the bramleighs this highclassl mercantile family seems to have hit his fancy exactly and he introduces us into the midst of this circle as if he were i presenting us to a party of his intimate friends there is the father of commanding presence and great prestige for i ability and intelligence his name is a mine of wealth in the city his sanction a tower of strength his smile orj frown a signal of success or failure he is not content to repose on his wealth for he has that love of business which makes it to him not a toil but a pleasure and in the semiretirement of his irish property he still conducts the house his eldest son is the antithesis of his father he has been brought up emphatically a gentlemannot that we wish to infer for one moment that colonel bramleigh was not a gentleman as well as a man of businessbut augustus is a gentleman and a man of taste when he is suddenly called to the head of the family he finds the position a heavy burden especially as it is then that he first becomes aware of the critical state of its affairs assailed by a pretender to its honour and property whose claim seem to rest on a solid foundation the second son has enlarged his views of life by

specimens of the english nobility they are both so utterly lfisb so impervious to any derati beyond their own advantage or the dqigity of their order mr lever is really quite spiteful towas lord culduff for divulging so remorselessly the secrets of his toiletdwelling so constantly on his wig powder and padding his antecedents and his shams but he has bestowed on his character as much pains as his lordship did on his own makeup and with equally good success for he has made him one of the most amusing noblemen in fiction his maxims and intrigues will be culled from the book and carefully quoted i wish my lordi heartily wishthat you had made this discovery earlier  madam said he slowly and with much solemnity of manner i owe it to each of us to own that i had made wbat you are pleased to call this  discovery while there was yet time to obviate its consequences mr very great admiration had not blinded me as to certain peculiarities let me call them of manner and if my vanity induced me to believe that i should be able to correct them it is my only error i protest my lord if my temper sustain me under such insults as this i think i might be acquitted of ill breeding 1 live in the hope madam that such a charge would be impossible  i suppose you mean said she with a sneering smile  when i have taken more lessonswhen i have completed the course of instruction you so courteously began with me yesterday precisely madam precisely there are no heavenborn courtiers the graces of manner are as much matter of acquirement as are the notes in music a delicate organisation has the same disadvantage in the one case that a fine ear has in the other it substitutes an aptitude for what ought to be pure acquirement the people who are naturally well mannered are like the people who sing by ear and i need not say what inflictions are both tand you really think my lord that i may yet be able to enter a room and leave it with becoming grace and dignity   you enter a room well madame said he with a judicial slowness now that you have subdued the triumphant air i objected to and assumed more quietnessthe blended softness with reservesour approach is good i should say extremely good to withdraw is however far more difficult to throw into the deference of leavetakingfor it is always a permission you seem to askthe tempered sorrow of depar ture with the sense of tasted enjoyment to do this with ease and with elegance and not a touch of the dramatic about it is a very high success and i grieve to say madam added he seriously it is a success not yet accorded you would you do me the great favour to repeat our lesson of this morning1 mean the curtsy with the two steps retiring and then the slide   if you do not think me well mannered my lord you must at least believe me very goodtempered said she iashing i let me assure yon my lady that to the latter quality i attach no importance whatever persons who respect themselves uover visit peculiarities of temperament on others we have our infirmities of nature as we have our maladies but we keep them for ourselves or for our doctor it is the triumph of the wellbred world to need nothing but good manners what charming people i take it that heaven must be peopled with lords inwaiting let me observe to your ladyship that there is no greater enormity in manners than an epigram keep this smartness for correspondence exclusively abstain from it strictly in conversai tion  i protest my lord your lessons come so thick that i despair of being able to profit by half of them meanwhile if i am not committing another solecism against good manners i should like to say good night lord culduf arose and walked to the door to be ready to open it as she approached meanwhile she busied herself collecting her fan and her scentbottle and her handkerchief and a book she had been reading hadnt virginie better come for these things  said he quietly oh certainly replied she dropping them hurriedly on the table im always transgressing but i do hope my lord with time and with that sincere desire to learn that animates me i may yet attain to at least so many of the habits of your lordships order as may enable me to escape censure he smiled and bowed a courteous concurrence with the wish but did not speak though her lip now trembled with indignation and her cheek was flushed she controlled her temper and as she drew nigh the door dropped a low and most respectful curtvey nc tofr  very nice very nice indeed a thought perhaps too for mali mean for the occasionbut in admirable taste your ladyship is grace itself my lord you are a model of courtesy i cannot even attempt to convey what pleasure your words give me said he presing her hand to his heart and bowing low meanwhile with a darkening brow and a look of haughty defiance she swept past him and left the room mr lever has not indulged in rollicking fun as was formerly his wont but the book is rich in smart repartee sly humour and sparkling sallies pointed and piquant his descriptions too are always graphic but never tedious for example what can be better than these two lines 11 her air and toilette were both queenlike and indeed her beauty was not less striking than either lady augusta though the wife of colonel bramleigh is not really one of the family  she dissociates herself from them excepting when she requires supplies she enjoys the elegancies of her italian villa and cringes for more money her jointure of 10001 ayear is a beggarly pittance she requires but little her tastes are not

sufficed to quiet the claimant who was an italian mixed up in plots and conspiracies he never dared to show himself and was supposed to have died at monte video this son is a far more formidable antagonist and his cause has been taken up by an attorney of as high standing as any man in the profession m pracontal as he calls himself is recommended by his lawyer not to take the name of bramleigh and is actually invited by the unsuspecting jack to meet the family lawyer at breakfast there are abundant reasons why i cannot confide the matter to any of my f milyone will suffice there is not one of them except my eldest daughter who would not be crushed by the tidings and though she has head enough she has not the temper for a very exciting and critical struggle what you tell me of jack andhis indiscretion will serve to show you how safe i should be in the hands of my sons and he is possibly about as wise as his brothers though less pretentious than the diplomatist and as for augustus i have great misgivings if the time should ever come when he should have convinced himself that this claim was goodand sentimental reasons would always have more weight with him than either law or logici say if such a time should arrive hes just the sort of nature that would prefer the martyrdom of utter beggary to the assertion of his rght and the vanity of being equal to the sacrifice would repay him for the ruin there are fellows of this stamp and i have terrible fears that i have one of them for a son almost as the colonel wrote these words the emergency arose he had a sudden seizure and some weeks of illness with impaired powers which terminated with his death as he opines augustus will hear of no compromise he declares that the law must decide the case  if the property be mine he says i cannot enjoy it in any comfort with that claim hanging over my head if it be his i would not keep him out of it for a day wealth has few charms for me i can descend to an obscure position and live on what i can earn  and he proves himself quite capable of carrying out this resolve by removing from castello with his sister refusing to touch one penny of the rents and procuring a small employment as consul at cattaro a little port on the adriatic whereby he incurs the high displeasure of lord culduff who consider it as a personal insult that an appointment he might have flung to his valet should be offered to his brotherinlaw and as something much worse that he should aocept it howerer it proves the luckiest turn in the wheel of fortune altogether lord culduf considers himself rightfully illused that a family with which he has con d himself should allow such a scandal as pracontals claims to be proclaimed to the world and come before a court of justice he had no intention of embark in a sinking ship lady augusta asks now i put it to yourself m pracontal and i ask was it fair was it honest was it decot of colonel bramleigh knowing the insecure title by which be held his estate to make m his wife p you know of course the difference of rank that separated us  you know who i wasi cant say am because my family have never forgiven me the mdsalliance therefore i say was it not atrocious in him to make a settlement which he felt must be a mockery   perhaps madame he may have regarded our pretensions as of little moment indeed i believe he treated my fathers demands with much hauteur  still he knew there was a claim and a claimant when he married me and this can neither be denied nor defended  ah madame sighed be w who would be stopped by sruples in such a cause it will be seen that the pretender has been introduced to her ladyship and she declare him chming ive made a little dinner for you for friday said lady augusta to her sister

ambition you accept the cormpanionship of his itellect instead of a share in his i heart but we have the very animated othip of jack and m julia lestrange a very sprightly young lady who is constantly driving her lover to despair as she so often shoe her brothers sense of propriety by her lively sallies and affected carelessness her fun is really nothing but the varnish with which she strives to smooth over the trials and difficulties of their perplexing position her heart is the truest as in counel her judgement is by all admitted to be the soundest as in the business of life her hand is found the readiest her taste the most correct her gaiety is charming she is the most cheery and cheerful companion the constant prop and support of her rather vacillating brother the parson for whom nelly is destined their love is as deep though not nearly as demonstrative as jacks in fact george lestrange seldom dares to hope and it requires all the encouragement and assistance his sister who is of course nellys dearest friend can give him to induce him to put his happiness to the test the book is thoroughly amusing and the interest throughout well sustained the lawsuit is an excellent screen on which to hang the sketches of character and the scenery is very varied for we have the grand house at castello with its lack of society glimpses of the lawyers dingy chambers and of the city with that grand projector mr cutbill who in fact like the portrait of the beautiful enrichetta lami in her fathers pictures pervades every cmne we are introduced to the english colony at albano with its squabbles which trouble the peace of mind of its chaplain george lestrange to the salon at rome with its great reception we have glimpses of the diplomatic circle as well as of life amongst the galley slaves at ischia and the elegant semibarbarism at cattaro  the bramleighs of bishops folly a good many years ago mr thackeray wrote a series of burlesque imitations of popular novelists and included mr lever in the catalogue setting down a chapter for his mimetie purpose under the heading of the fighting onetyoneth it was next to the continuation of  ivanhoe perhaps the most striking of the literary caricatures and was all the more telling from the fact that its extravagance seemed only a natural production of the style of the author of  charles omalley since then mr lever has it may be said never ceased to write commencing his career as a romancist by filling out wild irish stories with semihistorical pictures he has by degrees abandoned his old ground of action and gradually tried his hand in the more difficnlt department of domestic fiction he has not done this all at once  charles omalley  jack hinton and h harry lorrequer may be taken as types of the  onetyoneth  set  sir jasper carew roland cashel and  the odonoghue exemplify the transition period while the daltons  sir brook fosbrooke and the work now before us illustrate the latest manner in which mr lever has chosen to write we have not enumerated half his novels in this catalogue but those given are so far representative we may however include two tales con cregan  and  a lifes romance in which he evidently wished to exercise himself in a quieter vein than that to which he had originally accustomed his readers in both these stories there is an attempt at humour and satire as distinguished from mere fun in fact we may arrive at the key to the change in mr levers style by assuming that the reputation he achieved by  jack hinton  and his legendary comrades did not quite satisfy his ambition there is about all he does a certain ambition and conscientiousness and we are inclined to think that he felt as much vexed as pleased by his being considered a sort of notorious historian of hibernicomilitary farce critics would never give him credit for being anything but funny and he was determined to show them that he had a great deal more in him than a keen sense of the ludicrous now if we take it that he has aimed at the highest branch of his art the display of genuine humourthat humour which includes a divine compassion as well as a deep satirewe cannot regard him as being thoroughly successful he has sharpened his fun into wit but he has not refined it into humour in the  bramleighs  we constantly find smart pungent things but never one of those thrilling touches which suddenly seem to discover and illustrate a new aspect of life or thought then again we imagine that mr lever in his improved mode has got too strong a taste for drawing rogues and insincere people when you find so many of them and find them so loquacious you begin to suspect thi the author has been making them the mouthpieces of a oommonplace book in the  bramleighs  the character are as impartially charged with epigrams as are the maid mistress servant and master in the rivals augusta bramleigh writes letters so like the compositions of  cornelius odowd in blackcwood that you can perceive at once how nearly related both those personages are to mr lever mr cotbill might be taken from this book and placed on the stage for comedy withort polishing one of his sentences brighter than they now are julia lestrange is a favourite type of woman with mr lever we have met her before in  barrington as polly dill but  the bramleighs of bishops folly by chases levr tse vle londos smith elder a lo we should not object to meet her again elsewhere it is a common trick of rornaucists to describe a girl as hiding a passion under cover of a smart halfcynical indifference and the habit of contrasting her real sentiments with her conduct and both with the vehement outspokenness of her lover is one to which we are accustomed yet in mr levers hands this business does not weary ordinary novelists of either gender break down miserably in trying to manage repressed affections mr lever through sheer knowledge study and practice has arrived at the knack of delineating at least one kind of woman to the life and she is invariably a woman of tongue as well as of soul indeed it might strike the reader for instance when he gazes on the glittering of the conversational bodkin with which miss julia lestrange probes her friends and foes that her future husband jack bramleigh may not have altogether a good time of it after marriage if any one speaks off guard this young lady is down upon him instantly she does this so persistently that one cannot help dreading that the habit may become chronic and that the table of domestic happiness at which she is afterwards to sit down with a husband may be overfurnished with dishes unduly seasoned with attic salt mr lever of course may say he leaves her with her lover but if a notion of pity for a hero lingers in the mind of a novelreader when he lays down a book it is easy to see that such a frame of mind is inconsistent with a prolonged admiration for the heroine novels except the grand epics of fiction ought to close like the finish of a play in which we see every one going to the heavenly flies of the theatre amidst a pyrotechnic blaze and the sympathy of the fiddler the trombone and the pit or the friends of the author of the drama if it be a new one mr levers diplomatic agency has brought him into contact with ministers it would seem of the most remarkable conversational powers and of the machiavellian school of policy we ought not perhaps hastily to assume that lord culdnif is a sketch from nature or even a coloured photograph from the life we must bear in mind that of all writers mr lever is the most daring in one particular he never sticks at putting down the conversation of an emperor a grand duke or a duchess and in one of his books we remember he flushed a whole covey of kings and czars and served them up at a supper given by the wife of an irish attorney in paris there is something piquant about his courage in this respect his method of dishing their highnesses and graces must not be confounded with the mockturtle notabilities of authors who are bound by contract to find a countess for every column he brings great people into his stories not for ornament but for use and in the case referred to alexanderemperor of all the russias was simply introduced to set off honest paul rooney of dublin attorneyatlaw lord culduff one of the distinguished personages in the  bramleighs is not allowed to waste his time in idle statehe speaks and moves a great deal in the drama his talk is simply wonderful when this story was running in the cornlhill we called attention to the exceeding spirit and vivacity of its dialogue we may repeat that lord culduff mr cutbill and julia lestrange would be most effective on the boards lord culduff is in fact a little stagey he is so persistently manoeuvring and diplomatizing that you are inclined to think he was prepared by compression to figure in three acts rather than three volumes mr lever ought to remember a very clever saying of dr whatelys that an author should judiciously mingle chaff with oats the essence of food is not the most wholesome or the easiest of digestion lord culduff becomes dull from his constantly acting as it were up to the mark we have noted that mr lever makes ambitious exertions to rise from the level of fun to that of bumour in the  bramleigs 8 the endeavour is most marked and at least we are glad to record that if mr lever has not hit the centre of the target he has made a capital score on the whole the chapter on the church patrons at albano  is a delicious piece of exaggeration but it is too volatile for humour it is scarce possible to refrain from laughing at it we must refer our readers to it for themselves but it will exactly illustrate the sort of distinction we wish to indicate with reference to the plot of the  bramleighs rwe cannot say much in fact there is very little plot and whatarpsi extravagant an   tvu 1eie ottohere is is extrav sagant andmor orles unatifactory this is vexing because it is apparent that the book has not been carelessly written so much ability wasted upon so thin a story disappoints us almost in proportion to the talent displayed and half thrown away por we must have plots from our novelists and not simply clever dialogues or clever essay otherwise this branch of literature will degenerate in poor l lands into mere personal gossip twaddle and sentimental maundering when we say that mr levers book is interesting despite its plot and its lagging dilatory production of what ought to be the central portions of it we give that opinion with much regret we doubt his power of writing a purely domestic novel of so idealising facts and personages of ordinary life as to make us entertain a strong anxiety for them and their doings his work requires artificial binding he cannot from his very sprightliness of mind dwell and expand sufficiently on matters of slight surface import but of deep intrinsic significance to dig up and present that significance to us hence the comedy air the unreal comedy air of the smartest pages in the bramleighs he does not go in for the dutch painting of mr trollope which has a charm to which we confess we have been subjected without ever understanding in what it consisted mr levers characters talk in a much wittier style than the bishops and the clergymens daughters of mr trollopes works and we suspect that they talk themselves out of belief and yet mr trollope by constant tinting in the end brings his people and their places in his stories clearly and vividly enough before us the  bramleighs as far as plot is concerned might be reduced to one volume and yet we venture to say that any one who reads the book would regret the loss of the other two mr lever has that happy that blessed knack of never being dull even when inartistic this faculty or gift it is which enables us to accompany him so pleasantly through pages that have but little bearing towards our ultimate landingplace one reason why we can in such an agreeable temper put up with his wanderings is unquestionably on account of the purity and grace of his style mr lever has made vast strides in the direction of writing his sentences are beautifully clear compact and pointed in fact they are often too much so but we are so seldcn accustomed to see an author careful in this respect that we are not inclined to quarrel with the extra polish of mr levers paragraphs we sincerely desire he may be imitated especially by the ladies who now have the ear of the publishers for their benefit we may observe that he never indulges in tawdry bits of french that he puts nominative cases to verbs and that he seldom uses the word  alas and that he ohs as little as possible these are negative virtues to which may be added the positive accomplishment of a precision and a just knowledge of the weight and meaning of words which imparts a quality of smoothness and an air of good breeding to every chapter of the  bramleighs on the whole though we cannot venture to congratulate mr lever without reserve on his latest book we must observe that in it he gives proof enough that his intellect is as fresh and as unflagging as ever the  bramleighs  is with all its shortcomings one of the best novels of the year the occasional pictures of scenery and glimpses of angloitalian life are delicately and faithfully portrayed the ladies and gentlemen in the story are ladies and gentlemen with whom it is a pleasure to associate mr lever who professes a genuine knowledge of society never obtrudes it in the shape of guy livingstonian vulgarity and slanginess this he leaves to authors who think that elegance consists in patentleather boots and in ostensible quotations from the wine and dinner lists of their clubs we owe mr lever an apology for even connecting him by comparison with such a school with which indeed he has neither a sentiment nor a vice in common should the  bramleighs  not gain the same amount of popular favour as other works of mr lever it will simply be because he has chosen to put his strength in characterdrawing without deriving a due amount of aid for his design from a substantial and stirring plot  the bramleighs of bishops folly new novels by charles lever 3 vols smith elder  co carelessness is still mr levers chief fault but it may be a question whether his genius would not be hampered by attention to small details and would not lose in breadth and freedom what it might gain in accuracy the real merits of this novel are quite independent of the story mr lever has never been celebrated for plots though he has always had something to tell us in the present case he has made un attempt at a mystery and has rather bungled it but his strong point has always been his painting of peculiar characters since the days when he revelled in wild irish servants and enlivened war by dashes of eccentricity down to the maturer times in which he has created baron lendricks and viscount culduffs his novels have been lull of speaking portraiture drawn to some extent from real life and now and then too personal but tinged with his own reflection and saturated with his wit the volumes now before us add two at leas of these pictures to the lever gallery lord culduff is inimitable cutbill the engineer is drawn with more power but is not so perfect in finish the veteran diplomatist who is somewhat shortsighted and can therefore pass obnoxious persons without recognising them and slightly deaf so that he may smile with captivating deference when he does not quite catch a remark  who excels in the mysteries of the toilettable and of the special mission  who writes dispatches that are models of statecraft and spreads rumours that are false by whispering thom as secrets and who with all this lias the very smallest abilities is known to the foreign secretary as  the greatest ass in the whole careerand the word is a bold one and is only saved from being an impostor by having imposed upon himself as well as upon the outer worldmoves through the novel as graciously as he moves through society we think mr lever might have made more of his double courtship the opening steps of which are so artistically managed nor is this the only time when the breaks in the novel are too abrupt and when some halfdeveloped interest vanishes through a trapdoor but the excellence of mr levers portraiture is that we never notice either weariness or repetition lord culduff is ever charming ever new cutbill is as copious in resources as if he were planning a railway such marked characters in the hands of other writers would run great risk of sameness there would be the more danger of it as this is not the first novel in which we have beeu introduced either to the diplomatist or to the engineer mr lever has avoided that shoal and so far us these two characters are concerned he has not split on ay other the rest of the persons do not need such detailed examination we are left rather too much in the dark about pracontal the french pretender to the bramleigh estates the first sketch of col bramleigh is good but we hardly go below the surface and the same may be said of his sous his daughter marion promises more than she performs her first appearance and her hostility to julia lestrauge give her an air of pride and piquancy which are properly rewarded by the rank of viscountess though unfortunately lord culduff has to be taken with the title the subsequent development of character conveyed in marions letter to her sister strikes us as absolutely new and not warranted by anything that had gone before lady augusta bramleigh and julia lestrange are good in their way but they do not rise much above the conventional level which may be called mr levers second manner they are utility people of a good class and sometimes we think them more than that especially if we contrast them with the regular stage characters of the story it is mr levers desire to be full and natural that makes him expand those parts over which some would pass more quickly and when this expansion is effected by means of unnecessary characters we think there might have been a little less life and a touch of that art which may be mistaken for artifice the want of this is most apparent in the conduct of the story we doubt if the novel would have been any the worse for the omission of the pracontal episode parts ofthe plot are worked in with care jack bramleighs experience of the neapolitan galleys is serviceable in more ways than one but it is inartistic if not worse to have the secret about the practice of the painter land revealed twice over within a few pages it was hardly necessary that it should be told to jack bramleigh as he makes no use of it till he has heard of it from the other source in the place where it is needed its discovery is not very natural the effect that discovery has on cutbill aids the development of the plot but this aggravates instead of palliating the original fault there is something thoroughly stagey in the device of making a man hide in the place where we know that he will light upon valuable papers in spite of cutbills own explanation we can hardly think that ho acted consistently with his character in breaking open the receptacle of the parish registers at cantello if the solution of the pracontal mystery forms a really integral part of the plot it comes too late if on the other hand it is an afterthought it is too elaborate mr lever would have done better to let the claim on the bramleigh estates fall through in the manner already provided by the law but strangely enough lost sight of by his acutest lawyers neither sedley nor kelson seem to have remembered the existence of certain acts known as the statutes of limitation under which the right of bringing an action of ejectment is limited to twenty years from the time at which a right or title to real property accrues to a claimant or to the person through whom he claims it appears that the claim of pracontal was first advanced more than forty years before the date of the story this it is that makes the claim so formidable to col bramleigh and his adviser yet it is this very fact which ought to have set their minds at ease making allowance for such carelessness as this and for the blemishes which we have found in the story we must give the  bramleigli3 of bishops folly high rank among mr levers novels the writing is pleasant as usual the persons talk as only mr levers persons can talk and act as he would have them act the old rattle of the fourhorse drag which was once typical of mr levers style has been subdued into a smooth easy run like that of an express train where the rapidity of the pace is scarcely noticed till the travellers look back on their journey early impetuosity has been mellowed but its memory still survives and while mr lever is kept by the traditions of his youth from writing a dull page he feels somewhat too safe in the fame he has acquired to hazard any unusual exertions yet at least he is sure of his public and this time he may well be confident of a favourable verdict,ovel_contra
B1344,['8907261'],  the napoleon of notting hill by gilbert k chesterton lane humour in our day is so scarce and humourists are so few that mr chestertons farandole of farce may easily be wrongly praised it is farce but not pure farce for it often drops into buffoonery this vehement jumble of styles is fatiguing for the kingdom of humour cannot be taken by violence however brilliant farce is the staple of mr chestertons humour he is a farceur with ideas now farce is an excellent and an english thing by all means let us revive it but let us remember that humour has its laws as well as poetry or mathematics what are those laws alas humour still awaits its blackstone perhaps the best code of humour is that which is suggested by mr wattsdunton in his articleon  the renascence of wonder in chamberss  cyclopaedia of literature he points out that there are two kinds of humour absolute and relative  while in the case of relative humour that which amuses the humourist is the incongruity of some departure from the laws of convention in the case of absolute humour it is the incongruity of some departure from the normal as fixed by nature herself applying this test to mr chesterton we find that his humour is as a rule relative the incongruity which amuses him is a departure from the convention of monarchy the convention of municipal routine the convention of behaviour the convention of clothes he invents men who violate these ordinances in england eighty years hence the king is chosen like a juryman by alphabetical rotation the lot falls on auberon quin an alleged humourist in whom we recognize with the help of mr graham robertsons illustrations a shadowy likeness to mr max beerbohm humour doubtless deteriorates on a throne if king auberon were a real humourist he would not spoil the ripe humour of royalty by devising feeble practical jokes his humour is no laughing matter these imaginary borough councils with their provosts halberdiers banners and flamboyant ceremonial are not nearly so humorous as the real borough councils with their pompous mayors who glory in robes and chains of office not one of these visionary cities is so absurd as that actual city of westminster which emblazons its pride on the walls of its very lavatories this is a case indeed in which truth is funnier than fiction rich as is the humour of the borough councils there is something which is richer stillthe humour of the lord mayor and the city aldermen the incomparable humour of gog and magog not until adam wayne enters does mr chesterton reach the true realm of farce the conception of a man possessed by a devouring passion for notting hill is really farcical and the battles between the patriots of pump street and the municipal reformers who desire to annex it are full of that mockillusion that sham gravity which is the attribute of farce the kings dispatches as war correspondent of the court journal are capital fooling and the burlesque of the style of the late g w steevens is very amusing the gas and water strategy of the napoleon of notting hill is deliciously farcical like all empires notting hill is sapped by success its decline and fall lead to a philosophic dialogue between the sham king and the sham napoleon which lifts the farce into the higher region of irony   suppose i am god said the voice  and suppose i made the world in idleness suppose the stare that you think eternal are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy suppose the sun and the moonare only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant opened alternately in a neverending winksuppose t am god and having made things laugh at them   and suppose i am man answered the other and suppose that i give the answer that shatters even a laugh suppose i do not laugh back at you do not blaspheme you do not curse you but suppose standing up straight under the sky with every power of my being i thank you for the fools paradise you have made suppose i praise you with a literal pain of ecstasy for the jest that has brought me so terrible a joyi ask you in the name of heaven who wins  this passage certainly comes near to being absolute humour it propounds a kind of spiritual pantagruelism as an answer to the irony of an ironic god the idea of course is not new it is as old as the hillsor as the athenaum for more than a quarter of a century ago it was put forward in our columns  the humouristis so perpetually overwhelmed by the irony of the entire game cosmic and human from the droll little conventions of the village pothouse to those of london of paris of new york of pekinup to the apparently meaningless dance of the planets round the sunup again to that greater and more meaningless waltz of suns around the centrehe is so delighted with the delicious foolishness of wisdom the conceited ignorance of knowledge the grotesqueness even of the standard of beauty itselfso overwhelmed is the humourist with the whim of all thiswith the incongruity that isof the normal itselfwith the almightyjoke of the cosmos as it isthat he sees nothing  funny  in departures from laws which to him are in themselves the very quintessence of fun and he laughs the laugh of rabelais and of sterne  for he feels that behind this rich incongruous show there must be a beneficent showman he knows that although at the top of the constellations sits circumstance harlequin and king bowelless and blind shaking his starry cap and bells there sits far above even harlequin himself another being greater than hea being who because he has given us the delight of laughter must be good and who in the end will somewhere set all these incongruities right mr chesterton does not see higher than the harlequin god he does not see the  beneficent showman but he does see that in the ideal man the humourist and the idealist are two lobes of the same brain he finds this ideal man like tolstoy in the ploughmanthe common man whom mere geniuses like you and me can only worship like a god but does the common man really see the ridiculous as the sublime and the sublime as the ridiculous  if so the world is peopled with chestertons and infinitely more amusing than many of us find it the book is at any rate evidence that mr chesterton might do capital work in fiction if he would take adequate time and trouble  for his narrative moves easily and he has an immense romantic gusto,ovel_contra

B4052,['8592729'],  paul faber surgeon paul faber surgeon by george macdonald lld 3 vols london hurst and blackett mr macdonald belongs to the  nocturne  school of novel writers the word  novel as applied to any of mr macdonalds writings is a decided misnomer a book of sermons would be the more appropriate title as all his works are really such under an extremely thin guise he is a tautologist of a very high order indeed few authors are able to retain their popularity as he has done while incessantly reiterating with painful monotony the selfsame ideas as those which appeared in their first production perhaps the fact of different characters in different circumstances giving utterance to mr macdonalds religious profundities may explain this anomaly  paul faber  is even more wearisome than some of its predecessors all the characters having a strange tendency to preach as only mr macdonalds creations can preach which is saying much for their longwindedness the scene of the novel is the cathedral town of glaston the principal surgeon of whichpaul faberis the hero when a student pauls fancy had been entangled with a girl on whom an operation was being performed although occupying an inferior position in the social scale she had under pauls guidance acquired the polish and habits of polite society as time went on paul gradually began to cool and the birth of a little girl brought about a cessation of his visits cold letters taking their stead one day the girl and her baby disappeared and the story opens with paul at glaston where notwithstanding his pronounced atheism he is a popular man he obtrudes his obnoxious views upon everybody but his tender sympathies and desire to alleviate the misery of those around him counterbalance the ill opinion which most people had formed of him juliet meredith the heroine of whose antecedents nothing is known save by herself is lying dangerously ill and faber saves her life by opening one of his veins and injecting some of his own blood into her faber makes love to her but she keeps him in a state of suspense for some inscrutable reason till well on in the second volume meantime faber uses his influence with wingfold the curate to procure her work as a teacher but upon it being discovered that drake a superannuated dissenting minister is in difficulties the curate wishing to assist him in a delicate way proposes that juliet should board with drake which is agreed upon this drake had been minister of a local chapel but was compelled to resign through those bickerings so indigenous to small churches his family consisted of his daughter dorothy and an adopted child amanda whom he had picked up at some sort of creche in southwark drake after experiencing the sore strange ways of poverty suddenly acquires riches which he at once sets about spending nobly soon after this event juliet returns to her former lodgings where faber continues his solicitations which consist mostly of negative arguments against her religious beliefs at last glaston is surprised by the marriage of thc doctor aud miss meredith life was begiuning to grow luther monotonous for mrs faber and full of this feeling she wandered out one day in her husbands absence in passing the drapers shop a strange woman came out whose face mysteriously called up the past a little farther on she met mrs wingfold who insisted that juliet should accompany her on a visit to the rectors wife a storm came on and mrs faber was forced to remain overnight at the rectors next day being sunday she forgot fabers teachings for the nonce and accompanied the others to an adjoining chapel where the curate preached a sermon which coupled wtith the mysterious face of the previous day moved juliet strangely on coming home she  whispered three awful words  into her husbands ear regarding her past life he instantly casts her from him and in vain juliet bares her back aud holds up a whip to be punished  she disappears and the rumour spreads that she has drowned herself but she was really saved from doing so by dorothy drake who secretes her in osterfield park the new house which dorothys father had bought the day following her disappearance faber falls from his horse in a mad chase to find her he gets better but all his old strength of character and selfconfidence have fled at this juncture he recognises by the peculiar formation of her ear that amanda drake is his daughter and upon revealing the fact to old drake he learns that her mother the girl whom he had known in his student days was dead gradually it dawns upon faber that he has been too hard upon his wife considering his own sinful past his wife is about to be confined and by a stratagem on the part of dorothy drake he is brought to the place where his wife is in hiding the room is so skilfully darkened that he fails to recognise her and a second time he saves her life by opening one of his veins he latterly and by slow degrees discovers the truth and the stereotyped reconcilement takes place such is a brief rtsum of this most recent work of mr macdonald it is full of defects that would scarcely be pardonable in a tyro but it sparkles here and there with genuine power mr macdonald is too analytical and talks too much shop for he evidently cannot forget that he was once a minister it is preposterous to imagine that living men and women would talk as mr macdonald makes them do in his books one polwarth and his niece ruthtwo supernumerary charactersare very miracles in this respect talking of heaven liked winged angels this religious twaddlefor wc can call it nothing elsehas not a healthy tendency  it develops that effeminacy which apes at being a washedout likeness of one whose name we reverence too much to mention lightly we always keep men at arms length who wear long hair parted in the centre and who have a faraway sentimental look on their face it may be urged that mr macdonald is paradoxical with a view to giving greater emphasis to the truth  but it is possible to have just a little too much paradox all writers have their idiosyncracies and mr macdonald has his full share the irrepressible solitary horseman  style of g p r james finds a distinct echo in most of mr macdonalds writings occasionally mr macdonald breaks out into melodysave the mark and only in two instances with mediocre ability at page 34 in vol il in the lines beginning  my morning rose in laughter and in the  year song at page 140 vol iii he affects the quaintness of george herbert with but sorry success coleridge once asked lamb if he had ever heard him preach and lamb replied in his genial stuttering way that he had never heard him do anything else mr macdonald can draw a beautiful moral from this these three volumes  drag their fdow length along  with a wearisome tediousness enlivened here and there with a sermon in toto as delivered by the curate it is to be hoped that next time mr macdonald attempts to entertain the public it will be in a way worthy of that skill which he undoubtedly possesses,ovel_contra

chronicle is well rendered into english with judicious omissions but the racy fun whioh exists in the original evaporates in the translation and the chronicle itself is heavy it is a scandalous chronicle about the  lady of the fair cousins who first falls in love with a little cherubino of a page and not only instructs him in the whole duty of a courteous gentleman but also supplies him with money to boy fine clothes which in those lays were even more coveted than at present telling him to say his mother had sent them after he has become a noble knight and been her faithful adorer for many yean she disgracefully throws him off and becomes the paramour of a stalwart abbot and they both seek to turn the sieur de saintre into ridicule but he exacts such heavy revenge as makes one feel that the usage in those days was very rough both in peace and war we suspect this very chronicle was written as a further punishment to the lady jehan de saintre died in 1458 and the lady is supposed to have been marie daughter of king john who fought the battle of poictien and widow of alphonse of arragon duke de bar if this chronicle be a specimen of the novels of that period we are better off

in england it is certainly  pleasant  enough to entertain any novelreader of the present day written by one antoine de la salles in the year 1459 its sene is laid in the previous century little jehan the hero is a page of honour to king john the second of france so comely and graceful that at the age of thirteen he has won the favour of every one at court and most of all of the lady of the fair cousins a young widow of great beauty and as times go of modesty as great resolved never again to marry she has refused many a splendid offer but the gentle bearing of the little page has warmed her heart and she resolves that she will make his fortune therefore she often entices him to her side and the more she sees of him the more she likes him par amrur she warns him by sundry exhortations and examples of the way in which he is to flee the seven deadly sins to obey the ten commandments to adhere to the twelve articles of faith to pursue the seven cardinal virtues and in all other respects to deserve the name of true knight and true lover such an one she says is the most honourable of men when he is at mass he is  most devout at table the best conducted in the company of lords and ladies the most accomplished  with his ears he will never so much as hear an indelicate word nor will he allow his eyes an indiscreet regard nor from his lips an unhandsome word to escape with his hands he will not venture on dishonest liberties nor with his feet wander into forbidden quarters no other  will be equipped like him as for his armour it will be of the best and after the latest ordinance he will be well mounted and have his caparisons of the richest and for the love of his lady will ever be in the foremost a of the fight such an one the lady of the fair cousins wl     would have little jehan become and on his swearing fealty to her she proceeds to train him for all knightly service she provides him with fine clothing with armour and with equipage she so commends him to the favour of the king and queen that in due time he is promoted from being a page to the rank of trencher squire and after that he is sent abroad to do valiant deeds till coming home successful he is knighted with all honour in dance and in tournament at courtly festival and on the field of battle he acquits himself alike and in devotion to the lady whose love has brought all this about he gives of his knightly worth the greatest proof of all but according to custom their attachment is kept secret when she desires to speak to him she picks her teeth with her bodkin until he acknowledges the signal by rubbing his right eye with his finger or when he has anything to say to her he summons her in like manner and then they meet at night in a passage or in a meadow during his absence she wears no linen next her flesh on fridays and saturdays and as often as she thinks him to be in danger or hears of his success sbe throws herself on her naked knees in prayer or in thanksgiving but of these

however and though miserable and sick at heart he goesthe king and the queen watching him in their night shirts from the palacewindow and the lady of the fair cousins sorrowing almost to death at the

the lord de saintre ho applied himself so steadfastly to deeds of chivalry that he dies  the most valiant knight of all the realm of france such in very brief is the story of the novel which mr vancewho has already shown in his selection and rendering of romantic episodes of chivalric and mediaval france how well ho is able to reproduce the thought and represent the life of faroff timeshas translated with admirable taste and power he has selected the work and diligently applied himself to it not only for the sake of introdiucing to modern readers an antiquarian curiosity the favourite of sir walter scott and by remotest possibility originator of the thought out of whice  waverley sprang not only because in it are to be found merits of construction  entitling it to be called  the i waverley and even more  than the  waverley of a comparatively unlettered age and decided merits of description satirical and humorous but chiefly for the sake of aiding in the correction of some popular views concerning mediaeval society here says mr vance rwe have a man at a time when every forest was the haunt of fays when every dungeon had its dragon den its giant court its dwarf when hermits palmers wept recluses prayed when every lady had her milkwhite palfrey unprotected female her champion damsel her lover virgin her ravisher or deliverer when every castle was enchanted the

mediaeval taste for romantic literature as was chaucers earlier rhyme of sir thopas or even t cervantess later production of i don quixote but much  more than this like the works of chaucer and every other sensible writer of those daysand the knight of the tower whose book for the instructia of his daughters is t in part translated by mr vance was a very sensible writer t it shows that notwithstanding all the bombast of knightly enterprise and all the extravagance of minstrels lays not v withstanding all outside diversities of manner and appearance the realities of thought and life were in the middle ages not so very different from the thought and life of shakespeares day of fieldings or of our own common sense forbids us to believe in the magic that often occurs in the literature of those early times should not common a sense also make us hesitate to believe too literally on the a report of old romancers in the extreme and peculiar a dissoluteness of those same early times  does the frequent 1 coarseness of expression to be found in this literaturein itself less to be condemned than the prurient allusion of a richardson and hardly more than the cunning innuendo d of several popular novelists of the present generation i mean any more than that the persons for whom it was fi written found amusement in the grotesque sentimental d presentment of vice which in their own conduct theydb would shun be 5 the severe judgement passed upon the lady of the fair g cousins for her conduct is an evidence of the condemnation r heaped in the fourteenth century as in every other by all r but the most abandoned upon open violation of the moral d law speech was bolder but action was almost the same r vice of course was prevalent enough then but so it has ebeen in every age of the world and so it is now while e punishment was certainly not less severe in those days when the man who ruined the fair fame of maid or wife had to e make atonement at the point of the sword than now it is y when the crime is paid for in so many tenpound notes a in evidence of the fine feeling underlying all the coarsek ness common in mediaval literature mr vance calls special te attention to the chapter that he has translated from the is book of the knight of the tower  of an honourable lady is it is a portrait to be hung by the side of chaucers  good a parson the honourable lady is a widow of notable rs goodnature and christian worth the course of every ls day was thisto rise betimes and whilst she was dressis ing she had always two friars and two or three chapr lains who chanted both matins and mass but nothing 4 n more and as soon as she was prepared she would proceed i direct to her chapel and into her oratory and there would a say her prayers and after this she would go and put on 1 1i her outofdoor things and stroll about her meadows  i gardens and orchards and all the while in prayer and  converse with her god so the time passed till a ten  d or eleven oclock dinner after dining if she heard of any i  being ill she went or sent to visit them taking d with her the most generous wine and the best of s i  nourishment that her house might afford if any poor a gentlewoman was to be married she made a point of i being present at the ceremony and of making a large a i addition to the dowry  and she went to the interments u of poor gentlemen and ladies and she supplied to the 51 mourners tapers or anything else that might be wanting w and when it was all over she would return to her own at house to cat nor would she allow her people to put them to any charges after vespers she had supper ti and then after settling all accounts with her steward s went to bed where three days a week her nightgear was z of horsehair  yet for

B4396,['5901188'],  constance herbert by geraldine e jfwsbuuy 3 vols london  hurst and blackett 1855 it seldom falls to our lot to take up a novel in which the writer has contrived to engage and interest the feelings of the readers more completely than in the one now before us miss jewsbury the authoress has in the present instance dealt somewhat largely in madness and sudden death and the rewards bestowed upon the virtuous appear rather meagre when contrasted with the punishments allotted to the wicked nevertheless the general feeling which is likely to result from the perusal of so many terriblo events is not one calculated to leave a morbid impression upon the mind since the 44 morale  of the book is sound and the chances are that most persons would return to the history of their own lives with increased satisfaction after contemplating upon paper so much wholesale miser in the second volume we have a glimpse of aunt margaret endeavouring to console the heroine constance herbert in the midst of a terrific affliction by reciting to her the still greater woes encountered by herself in earlier days we presume on the principle of larochefoucauld who tells us 44that in the misfortunes even of our best friends there is something not altogether displeasing to us at the conclusion of the aunts story the heroine with great naivete is made to express her astonishment that people ever should succeed in living to the age of eighty  indeed we fully under such circumstances agree with the heroine in her doubts and can suggest no moro practical expedient for struggling through such a weight of calamity than a box of parrs life pills the male characters in this book are by no meads pleasing specimens of the  genus homo charles herbert the father of the heroine who turns out eventually a wretch possesses in his early life a degree of credulity and trustfulness that is quite refreshing in these days of doubt and scepticism for instance he falls in love with though daughter of  a respectable yeoman who is a refined superior young woman failing to obtain the parents consent to the marriage be departs for india where shortly after his father informs him in a letter of kate hathertons the superior young womans marriage with somebody else the way hi which the news is received by charles herbert we give in the authors own words  charles herbert suffered keenly after this destruction of his hopes but he knew kate hatherton better than his father did and his faith in her was not shaken by her marriage with another man and his affection for her continued as strong as ever on his return home after a lapse of years he finds his ladyelove a widow the meeting is accidental and unexpected he greets her in the following style   kate my kate they grasped each others hands and it was as though they had never parted in the mean time that matters may be complete he has proposed to another lady miss wilmot who has given him her affections and fixed the wedding day this little affair does not appear to give him much uneasiness having as he tells us acquainted miss wilmot of his early attachment he irnagines that now that he has not only found his kate but found her free it does not appear that he over exerted himself in his 6earch miss wilmot is to resign him as a matter of course the abrupt manner in which he acquaints her of this rather startling change in her destiny we quote from the volume before us 441 am come to ask you to dissolve our engagement since this morning i have seen kate hatherton whom i never thought to see in this world again i give you my honour i did not seek her i did not know even that i still loved her till she stood before me in that place you left me this morning i cannot see what good it would do you to marry me knowing what you do for i told you all that kate hatherton had been to me and i tell you now all that she is thero would be no honour if i kept my engagement when the first sight of her made me forget youand myself too if i had been conscious of the hold she had over me i would never have spoken a word to you or to any other woman but it is too late to go into all that now 44 then were you quite indifferent about me  did you never caro for me   gasped miss wilmot 441 tell you sarah that i did not know my own heart i was not indifferent to you i cared for you more than any other woman i ever sawexcept one i loved her before i loved you and i shall love her till i die it is because you are a good woman and because you were my friend before i ever thought of you as my wife that i ara come in this way and because i thought you would see and feel how all this bas befallen miss wilmot sat completely stupefied with the weight and suddenness of the blow that had come upon her but in all wounds the great suffering does not follow immediately and she waa astonished to find how little pain she felt after a dull pause during which she pulled off the riug he had given her when they became engaged she said 44 you are free charlesquite free here is your ring again will you tell my uncle or shall i   44let me tell him said charles 44 and then if he thinks it needful to blow out ray brains he can 41 he will scarcely feel called upon to do that replied miss wilmot with a slight bitterness  charles herbert looked at her for the first time since the interview had begun his eyes had certainly rested upon her but without any personal consciousness that he saw ber sarah i hope with all my soul that i have been a coxcomb and that you do not really care for roe so much as i allowed myself to fancy you will get over it and no one who knows you can believe you to have been slighted a spasm of painful indignation passed across miss wilmots face  charles herbert said she rising  it is because i love yon it is because i was your friend before i was your affianced wife it is because i understand your nature better than any one else in the world is likely to do that i do not blame you for what you have done this day now leave me there is nothing more to say between us in this scene the authoress shows a knowledge of human nature miss wilmots mind is wholly unprepared to receive this cruel intelligence contrary therefore to the usual practice of authors in such cases there is neither immediate fainting nor hysterics but afterwards when her mind has digested all that has taken place she suffers severely enough there are other passages in this book that we might have selected showing the dramatic powers of the authoress to perhaps greater advantage but we abstain from quoting them for fear of diminishing the interest of the story we shall therefore limit ourselves to saying how heartily we concur in the sentiment uttered by aunt margaret  who says the more ones life resembles a novel the more uncomfortable it is and we feel we cannot too strongly recommend our friends to be cautious how they let their lives resemble this one if they can by any means avoid it,ovel_contra

B8893,['8524263'],  sister louise sister louise or thc story of a womans repentance by g j why temelville london  chapman and hall it is pleasant to be disappointed in a book that opens in the most approved style of the historical novel with a dialogue between two soldier friends in the low countries two hundred years ago  who call each other comrade dash dowtn a plumed hat toss oft a stoup of wine and have a faroff memory in their deep grey eyes and for this reason because the vividness of the local colouring though safety in the application of it and the tinsel of the dummy royalties that crowd the canvas make a novel whose scene is remote in time and country the citadel of ignorant and shallow writers and though fools paradise of those vacuous gapers who must have blazonry and bunting even in what they read and so  i faith and  byre ladye  do duty for dialogue  and a surface of pomp and circumstance ostentation and affectation pass themselves off as the workings of human nature on that large class who have either never felt or never analysed their feelings but when an author who has some instinctive insight into though machinery of thc heart and who writes besides with that  easy grace and selfrestrained strength which is the sure token of a gentleman of culture and a man of the world selects a certain century to frame his picture in it is the picture and not the frame that we observe and his manipulation of accessories that are unfamiliar to us makes us either admire his skill the more or possibly regret that the strangeness of the surroundings distracts and distorts our view of the characters conspicuous instances of this are  romola and those novels of scott which are chiefly historical surely it is always in spite of and not because of their pecuharity that we praise those books and it is because in  sister louise an honest development of characters wrought with no little skill and delicacy outshines its setting of upholstering gorgeousness that we say it is a good book worth writing and worth reading an outline of the story is briefly this louise de la valliere and athenee de mortemar are two girls well born and straitly bred who become maids of honour at the court of the youthful and beautiful louis quatorze with the strictest propriety wre are told how they both of them ceased in any sense of the word to deserve that designation louise has a devoted lover the marquis de bragelone he of the faroff eyes athenee has a dashing admirer henri le blanc the brother of louise and these two gentlemen complicate themselves in fruitless rivalry with the king to whose attractions both ladies but for different reasons succumb each retiring at the close of his reignlouise to the selftormenting repentance of a convent where she dies and athenee to the seclusion of displacement and disgust where she passes from our view  and the widow scarron madame de maintenon reigns in her stead the person and character of the heroine louise are carefully and we should imagine truly drawn  soft blue eyes and tender quivering mouth delicate rather than regular of features a face of which the primrose is the type among flowers and the pearl among precious stones her figure was well formed and agile though hampered by a limp in afterlife rivals declared she was lame and denied she was beautiful but the very vehemence of their criticism offers its best contradiction    her nature was one of entire selfdevotion totally irrespective of self in striking contrast to her stands out the saucy and unscrupulous athenee who loves the king designedly and not because she cannot help it supplants her early friend jilts her first lover is worldly to the backbone and yet not without shallow qualms of temporary contrition nor without that intermittent breath of a better affection which blows hot and cold in so many shallow women there is great sameness in love affairs says this roue of twenty one man pleases more than another and that is all and so for a vantageground she marries the rich monsieur de montespan and keeps a line to hold her former lover weaving her net round the king all the while louise on the other hand is a tender and true woman all sensitiveness and selfabnegation  every sense and instinct of nature and romance held in thrall by youthful kinghood and worshipping with idolatry a thoroughly selfish man  simply because something must be offered up there is something very touching in the story of her love and how it slowly palls upon the king and how she falls from disappointment to despair till remorse and a broken heart beat themselves away in an ascetic infatuation and the king the petted and pampered the favourite of gods and men following his better instincts in trying to love her notwithstanding the boredom which grows upon him all the more because of her utter resignation of all her personality to him he too is painted with truth and not without force but there is an uneasiness about any character that is half fact and half fiction still it is work worthy of an artist to trace the course of such a love as his  whose gradations are slow and sure custom indifference weariness and neglect he is princely according to the popular idea of kinghood in magnificence in assumption of omnipotence in graceful treading on the necks of men  he wages battle under the eyes of ladies and in full dress but indeed it is not so difficult to draw something that will pass muster for a character if you put it on a pedestal saying  this is a great king and the millinery is a la louis quatorze to reveal what detail of plot there is would be hardly fair for there is very little and the book does not depend upon its plot and is all the more readable for the simplicity of it the description of the hunt is good or it would not have been written by the author of  katerfelto the conversations are terse and witty and smack very strongly of the french the opening scene in the low countries is superfluous  and the whole of the last book which is an enlargement on the penances of  louise de la misericorde might have been curtailed with advantage but even as it is the story is commendably short nor is there a weak sentence throughout nor one that jars upon the taste even the magnificence is not tawdrily described the book is natural notwithstanding its setting and is obviously written by a gentleman the sentences are occasionally very long but they never seem longwinded it is true that we meet with many familiar commonplaces in an elegant disguise and that many a harmless sentiment stalks by us with an unwonted dignity but it is none the less a pleasure and not a common one to meet with a story not very long and not very pretentious temperately and smoothly told where there is nothing of strain or vulgarity or rant no stilts and no crimes except adultery  no horrors and no vapours of course there is much that might be quarrelled with is it true as is here laid down that when a man and a woman carry a sorrow between them the man displays and the woman feels it the most  is it true that there is a sinking of the heart which never deceives and is surely followed by evil  it is rather that the shadow of the present throws itself back into the past but assertions like these not being written by one of the great masters of mental analysis are harmless enough and were possibly not intended as deliberate conclusions on the other hand the book abounds in aphorisms and epigrammatic bits of description here is one which if it is original is too good not to be quoted  the princess henriette was just enough of a stuart to see clearly the one side of a question to ignore the other and to defy the consequences of the whole a book that is short natural and interesting

certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of english society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design perhaps mr thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern english aristocratic society his pictures most likely are not faultless whose are a line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation a man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation and now what is the nature of this fashionable world according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   vanity fair  pendennis  newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one the land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life mr thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that haut tonne is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of haut tonne can present us for the most part with such elements as these is the marquis of steyne a representative personage and his sister lady kew and the most noble farintosh is miss ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and lord kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman does love among these upper clwases usually signify flirtation and life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the world a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand marriage a convenient arrangement and religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like potichomanie and death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones self a still more disagreeable occurrenceare these the polite definitions l it would appear so perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes but do the middle get off any better rather worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of vanity fair than themselves a doleful and depressing view of human nature surely true we have mr pendenniss mother and lady walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have mr pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model i wife and worship him the colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of mr i thackerays creations we can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement with tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample

disgusted with existence in his companion the youngpainter john james tidley mrthackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin the application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to truth with a smile or a wink to fashion in the same moment  praising pilgrim and faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in nuditty fair the chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 vol i p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us there is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in the newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as the kickleburys fur instance which the times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination,ovel_contra

school of a great and original painter he has his reward too for he has caught much more than the mere trick of style by no means difficult to imitate and has succeeded more nearly than any other writer we have met in entering into hawthornes psychology with its half morbid and entirely weird conception of life we incline to think  the madonna of the future  the most artistic of his tales though that which gives the title to his book is most fully worked out and is very subtle in treatment recalling here andi there the  septimius  of his model there is one blot in the book the material ghastli ness of the endingof one story the romance of certain old clothes which is more like poe than hawthorne and which we think the author will feel on reflection would have gained in impressiveness by the omission of the last detail and the substitution of a mere look of frozen terror on the dead face the incident as it stands mars the whole conception of perdita with which it is entirely out of keeping eglantine makes no advance but rather retrogression in its authors literary work for it is by no means so good a novel as any of its three precursors there are tokens throughout of too much facility in mere production of copy and too little pains in reducing that copy to symmetrical form to say nothing whatever of artistic conscientiousness in detail which is not atoned for by the occasional introduction of clever sentences and paragraphs the story if it may be so called is an autobiographical mono logue with but little interest since the only attempts at special delineation of character depict types which are tediously common in the modern novel such as the gracious and insincere matron of society and the mature young lady who affects gushing childishness and in these days of realistic painting it is not too much to ask even a lady author to be correct in details meant to give local colour and finish the daughter of a great scientific philosopher of wide general learning as the narrator of the story is supposed to be would not again and again cite the differential calculus  as the tremendously abstruse subject which her fathers distinguished visitors habitually discussed with him they would be just as likely to discuss the rule of three nor would she include gibbons english history as forming along with the decline and fall part of the favourite reading of her model coastguardsman at least it was inconsiderate if such were the case not to make the learned mr leslie seize on the book hitherto unknown to bibliography and give it to the reading public which would only too gladly welcome such a discovery it may be carpingly minute criticism to say that the st bees hood which the model broad church parson of the book wears and of which the author who attempts dutch painting makes a good deal is not purple but a wonderful combination of red and white but that a writer wlio has evidently a turn for marketing and cookery with a hearty relish for her victuals should give as a proof of the utter imbecility of her gushing lady that young persons belief that eggs arc or ought to be sold by the pound strikes us as showing very little grasp of the economical bearings of the subject would it surprise her to hear that more than one american legislature has recently enacted that all eggs are henceforth to be sold by the pound and that the average dozen must turn a given weight on the ground that the present system of selling by mere number irrespective of size is unfair to the purchaser and a permanent discouragement to careful breeding since no advantage is now gained in the market by the farmer who brings the finest and heaviest eggs for sale over his competitor who looks to quantity alone several other questions social and religious are settled in the book just as decisively and with exactly the same amount of intelligent understanding as this one and we would cheerfully give all the judgments and the longwinded reasons for their formation in exchange for a little more life and movement in the somewhat wooden puppets of the tale  jocelyns mista7ke derives its interest almost wholly from its central figure which is a very good study of character mrs spender has not sought to devise novel situations for her plot and has contented herself with using materials which have served many authors before but she has employed them better than usual the main situation in the book for example is not very different from that in a once popular story e laiu wyndham yet there is no likeness at all in treatment so that the sense of triteness does not strike the reader mrs spenders english is unusually good and she has learned the art of working her opinions on men and things into the web of her story in stead of merely intercalating homilies after the fashion of too many of her sisters with the certainty of having them skipped by the judicious reader who desires in the emphatic language of a schoolboy uttered in the present critics hearing more story and less jaw the jocelyn of the book is very skilfully drawn an impetuous wilful passionate imaginative woman in whom the perceptive faculties are far more matured than the reflective who feels but does not reason and who is from temperament what frenchmen call tate montee and americans high falutinc in season and out of season the chief success of the book is the manner in which the author conciliates the sympathies of her readers in favour of the very defective heroine and makes them understand how she could win and retain the affections of two men of exceptional mark and power though of different types and that without her having brain enough with all her imagination and fluency to appreciate the best qualities of either one particularly happy touch quite true to nature is that where jocelyn spoils her application for the post of governess by springing on her hobby at a chance word of her proposed employer and delivering a lecture then and there on the development of woman mfore we think might have been made of the contrast between the fiery and courageous heroine and her vacillating brother but where it is brought out at all it is well done finally the toile of the book is entirely high and sound and though it does not belong to the small first rank of novels that will live it rises in type and diction far above the ephemeral stories of the season olt of society is a commonplace and rather dull book written in a style which is alternately fine and slipshod gorgeous in adjectives and hazy in grammar it belongs to the school of transpontine melodrama according to which hardness selfishness and vice are habitual characteristics of those who move or try to move in refined and wealthy circles while generosity and virtue must be souglht among those who are out of society that a life of much ease and little responsibility is unfiavourable to loftiness of aim and energy of action is doubtless true enough but mrs pulleyne must know very little indeed of modern engrland if she imagines that the line can be drawn as she draws it the artisans who refuse to associate with labourers or even to use the same houses of call the shopboys who rob tills to pay gambling debts the working men who correct their wives with iron clogs are on the whole not more admirable citizens than mrs pulleynes aristocrats and are real flesh and blood while her characters despite of the dedication of her book to a lady of princely rank are clearly evolved from a not very vivid imagination and do not by any means convey the impression of being studies from life and personal contact especially as she has not mastered the somewhat intricate system of english titles of rank robert forrcster is the work of a very inexperienced hand and the best counsel for the author is to attempt a play and to put the manuscript into the hands of some practised manager or actor in order to see how much and what would be cut out curiously enough there is a chapter in the book wherein the heroine by her frank criticisms induces a lady friend to give up novelwriting as not possessing the necessary faculty and being unable to see what is expedient in a book meant to win public approval the actual story in robert forester scarcely occupies onefifth of the volume and the remainder is entirely taken up with digressions sometimes on scenery and more often on what the characters could should might ought or would have thought or done while their actual doings are compressible into a very small bulk indeed thus in one chapter of the book two persons engaged to two other persons meet for an avowal of their preference for one another and nearly twelve pages are given to a chapter which immediately follows this whose whole contents consist of the fact that their conversation was overheard by one of the other pair and that she did not like it ten words in the chapter whiich describes the meeting would have been enough and this is just the place where an experienced manager would have ruthlessly cut down the copy were it a play nor are the descriptions of scenery vivid enough to be worth the space they occupy we have three living novelists who can write of scenery so as to delight their readers air black perhaps first mir blackmore a good second and amr george macdonald third though if his

B7167,"['8690225', '8597618']",  a terrible temptation london saturday august 3 1s71 literature by charles reade t 3 vols chapman  hall every reader of novels is we suppose familiar by this time both with mr reades merits and with his faults we ali know his power of giving interest to a story and holding us bound and unable to lay the book down till we have read to the very end not that we may solve a riddle as is the way with too many novelistshe never keeps the secret till the endbut solely that we may know how everybody is to escape from the difficulties in which he delights to plaoe his characters and that we may enjoy to the full his ingenuity in keeping distinct every thread of the seemingly tangled web of his plots we are in the secret the whole time but the personages of the story are not and it is in their gradual enlightenment not in ours that the interest of mr reades novels lies then again how well we know his gift of the most uncompromisingly hard hitting when he has got hold of a social abuse and that not always in vain  this however does not apply in the present case he has no doubt a little fling at his old foe the private asylum but strange to relate this time the asylum is kept by a doctor who is neither a fool nor a ruffian but an agreeable and somewhat scientific mau for whom mr read evidently has a slight liking we say has a liking advisedly for one of our authors great merits is the personal knowledge so to speak which he always has of his characters of course he sees them through readean spectacles  that is they say and do things which no mortal ever said or did  they insert unnecessary pronouns and auxiliary verbs in conversation and talk in capitals and italics large type and small and so forth  but still they are creatures and not puppets and we feel interested in them and feel too when we have finished the book that we have added to our list of acquaintances having generalised sufficiently we proceed to give a short outline of  a terrible temptation nor shall we thereby interfere with the pleasure of possible readers for as we have said mr reades stories do not depend for their interest on unexpected revelations at the end of th e third volume the story then is as follows there are two cousins of the name of bassett sir charles baronet and richard the father of richard though the elder son and heir to an entailed property has been before the opening of the story compelled in order to pay his debts to sell the reversion to his father the grandfather of the cousins and to join him in cutting off the entail the property and estate of lluntercombe has accordingly descended to the father of sir charles who for political services was made a baronet at the beginning of the story we find the cousins in rivalry for the hand of a beautiful miss arabella bruce she naturally prefers the baronet who though decidedly  fast has besides his title and property a more pleasant disposition than his cousin the latter who has never forgiven the arrangement by which the property was lost to him is further stung to fury by his defeat and casts about to get his revenge fortune favours him so far that he discovers a liaison between sir charles and a certain miss somerset whose position in life may be understood when we say that she lives in a sumptuous house in mayfair is the admiration of duchesses in the park and expresses herself on one occasion thus the words were we believe once really used lucky for you beggars that i am a lady or i would break every dd window in the house  and the introduction of this person reminds us of a fault of mr reades which we cannot pass over in silence such things arenor do wo so much object to their use for purposes of fiction though we think he has dwelled unnecessarily on miss somerset and given us a little too much of the private life of the demimonde  but we must regret the want of reticence which he shows in alluding in other places to matters which are usually passed over lightly by most modern masters of at least english fiction we do not point out the passages for fear of laying ourselves open to a similar reproach but again we say we regret it for it renders it absolutely impossible for us to put this book with all its merits into the hands say of our unmarried sisters to resume the story richard bassett by means of an anonymous letter succeeds in breaking off the match for a time at a moment too when sir charles has just severed at some expense to himself the ties which bound him to the lady of doubtful reputation and has made up his mind to live as an homme range the lovers are in despair but the truth comes out through the intervention of miss somerset herself and they are at length married richards malice pursues them however he annoys sir charles by every means small and great in his power saves money and buys small farms bordering on his cousins estate shoots his pheasants prosecutes him unsuccessfully for a libel and ultimately succeeds in getting him shut up in the asylum to which we have already alluded now appears the dens ex machind without whom no novel of mr reades would be complete whom we already know under the guise of dr sampson martin wittenhaagen dr amboyne and others  the person of rough exterior and rude manners but possessed of a ready invention and an inexhaustible willingness to use it in the service of his neighbours in the present instance it is one mr rolfe a novelist who knows everybody and all about them and who undertakes the job con amore meanwhile lady bassett has yielded to the terrible temptation which gives its name to the book they have been married some years and she is still childless she perceives and is made wretched by perceiving her husbands mortification and goaded by the fear of losing his affection she contrives with the assistance of her maid to deceive him and the world by a pretended confinement and to pass off another womans child as her own this maid is the sister of rhoda somerset the former mistress of sir charles and has by a series of chances directed more or less by richard bassett who is enamoured of her come into the service of lady bassett the supposititious heir is her illegitimate son by richard by the time the deception is complete sir charles has been freed from the asylum and returns home delighted at having at last an heir the remainder of the story is occupied with lady bassetts perplexities and miseries arising from her fault through which we will not take our readers it will be sufficient to say that richard suspects something of the truth that sir charles is not the father of the boy but is on an entirely wrong scent that children are born bond fide to the baronet and his wife that our former acquaintance miss somerset turns up again married respectably and with a turn for preaching like a famous predecessor of hers in real life that circumstances render it necessary for lady bassett to confess her fault at the moment when richard thinks he has played his masterstroke of revenge and that a reconciliation between the cousins cemented by though marriage of sir charless real heir to richards daughter ends the book the story as we have said is told with all mr reades power and we may add with nearly all his usual eccentricity of style we do not think on the whole that we should like to see him alter this for without it he would not be the charles read that we know but we hope no one else will imitate it for what is tolerable chiefly by reason of its originality would be an intolerable affectation if not original one question wc should like to ask before concluding where in the world did mr read get hold of the lunatics invention of the  airloom of which he even reproduces the diagram  after reading it we feel almost mad ourselves it produces the same effect upon us as does an hours conversation with a person whose mind is deranged and we can only say that if mr read evolved it from his own consciousness he possesses to a most extraordinary degree the power of mentally  putting himself in the place  of the character whom he desires to depict  new novels 1 terrible temptation a story

did once and with excellent result in  the cloister and the hearth he will certainly produce a work calling for lengthy comment and one that we may be pretty sure will call for hearty praise we do not say that  a terrible temptation does not deserve praise but there is hardly anything more to be said about it than has been said about his earlier  stories of the day if it is not quite as much of a novel with a purpose  as some others it is quite as realistic quite as j clever and quite as irritating no one wdio reads the first  chapter of one of his tales can abstain from reading on to  the end  but when we have read the book through we j feel that we have been dragged through a dissecting room i and forced to look at a ghastly array of diseased limbs i listening all the time to an anatomical lecture that i3 quite true but by no means amusing mr read is a social anatomist of great power and he generally makes it his business to discourse about social diseases that is a good thing to do now and then at any rate and even through novels if by novels the public can be most influenced but he who does it should never forget that in exposing the diseases his duty is to show how they may be avoided mr read does sometimes forget this and he has forgotten it especially in a terrible temptation this novel has no moral at all unless its purpose be to prove that lying is sometimes a good thing and that wives ought sometimes to deceive their husbands unless we except a mad doctor who has not much to do with the story and a boy and girl who are brought in merely to untie the knot which the author has made every person in this novel is disagreeable the plot of the novel is also disagreeable it begins and continues in hatred malice and all uncharitableness and if it does not end therewith this group of vices is only withdrawn to make room for exemplification of the novel doctrine that dishonesty is the best policy at any rate in the case of wives whose husbands smoke so much as to interfere with the development of species the husband who thus errs is sir charles bassett a rich man who falls in love after the ordinary amount of dissipation and who marries the object of his affections after considerable difficulties the author of these difficulties is his cousin richard bassett who thinks that he has been defrauded of the family possessions and who is accordingly very anxious to get them back or at any rate to secure their descent to his son when he gets one he not only wants sir charles not to marry but would like to be himself the husband of the lady of sir charless choice therefore he brings to light and shows in false colours a liaison between sir charles and a fashionable prostitute whose ways and dispositions are described with remarkable precision and who in due time is converted and brought forward as a very successful openair preacher sir charles bassett however breaks through the snare set for him by his wicked cousin and the wicked cousin has to lay other snares which provide much of the material of the novel it is to counteract them and one of them in particular that sir charles bassetts wife yields to  a terrible temptation having no child of her own she pretends to have one and by an ingenious contrivance of the authors the baby she adopts is an illegitimate child of richard bassetts the advantages of that contrivance are evident it gives a subtle charm to the working out of richard bassetts schemes for the injuring of his own son and when that son grows up and proves an utterly worthless fellow it gives wonderful point to a scene which might have been written for the melodramatic stage in which richard bassett having with a refinement of cruelty planned that sir charles shall send his own son to trial for housebreaking discovers that he and not his cousin is the boys father we need not tell more of mr reades plot or name more of his characters that those characters are skilfully described need not be said but if they are natural they are graceless whether they sin much or little they sin on to the end and the only reflection to be drawn from their careers is that sin if rather ugly and troublesome works its own cure when sir charles bassett having reduced his daily allowance of cigars lady bassett has a son of her own she continues to deceive her husband about the reputed heir on very frivolous grounds and she deceives him to the end her virtue being thereby apparently enhanced though it is true that she is not represented as being quite as virtuous as the sometime courtesan who becomes a streetpreacher we should have been grateful to mr read had he really attacked some of the false conventionalities of the day and shown that true morality may be very different from the morality of either pulpit or drawingroom ethics but  a terrible temptation does not show that it only shows once again that mr read is a very clever writer,ovel_contra

to find from mr lewis carrolls preface that he first collected his incidents and dialogues or fragments of them and then invented a story to use these to the best advantage he reveals in fact in his preface his method of composition the chapters headed fairy sylvie and brunos revenge  are with some slight alterations reprinted from a tale in aunt judys magazine 1867 not till seven years after itt publication did the idea of making it the nucleus of a longer story present itself te the authors mind as the years went on writes mr carroll i jotted down at odd moments all sorts of odd ideas and fragments of dialogue that occurred to mewho knows how with a transitory suddenness that left me no choice but either to record them then and there or te abandon them to oblivionand thus it came to pass that i found myself at last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litteratureif the reader will kindly excuse the spellingwhick only needed stringing together upon the threat of a consecutive story to constitute the book i hoped to write only  the task at first seemed absolutely hopeless and gave me a far clearer idea than i ever had before of the meaning of the word  chaos and i think it must have been ten years or more before i had succeeded in classifying these oddsandends sufficiently to see what sort of a story they indicated  for the story had to grow out of the incidents not the incidents out of the story such was the  genesis of  sylvie and bruno being written by mr lewis carroll it is needless to say that it is full of amusing things and not without some of  the graver thoughts of human life nevertheless it falls far below  alice in wonderland and the illustrations of mr harry furniss are by northeast means worthy of his reputation the narrator is an impersonal being who comes and goes like miss meadows and the girls in  uncle remus and never takes much more shape he lapses into fairyland every time he falls asleep and returns without any sense of strangeness and so well is this managed that we accompany him thither with perfect ease and are quite as able to make the best of both worlds as he is the characters ara numerous there is a warden who is deposed from his wardenship and finds refuge in fairyland as kinga subwarden with a wicked and very stout wife who  looks like a haystack out of tempera distinguished doctor who has  actually invented three new diseases besides a near way of breaking your collarbone he j wean boots specially made for horizontal weather and is so clever that  sometimes he says things that nobody can understand there is another professor who lectures with his back turned to the audience and a gardener who breaks out into snatches of song which have the old ring he thought he saw an elephant that practised on the fife  ue looked again and found ic was a letter from his wife  at length i realize he said the bitterness of life   all these characters and others too are amusing but sylvie and bruno are as they j ought to be more interesting and amusing still from first to last they are delightful bruno who is addressed  yreince an abbreviation of your royal highness is even more fascinating than sylvie   i hope you have had a good night my child said the professor to him bruno looked puzzled  is had the same night oo ve had he replied  theres only been one night since yesterday   again when the two children encounter the gardener who being told by sylvie that bruno is her brother asks  was he your brother yesterday  course i were cried bruno who had gradually crept nearer and didnt at all like being talked about without having his share in the conversation  ah well the gardener said with a kind of groan  things change so here whenever i look again it a sure to be something different  yet i does my duty  i rets up wriggleearly at five if i was uo sud bruno i wouldnt wriggle so early its hs bad as being a worm  he added in an under i tone to sylvie  but you shouldnt be lazy in the morning bruno said sylvie  remember it a the early bird that picks up the worm  it may if it likes  bruno said with a slight yawn  i dont like eating worms one bit 1 always j top in bed till the early bird has picked them np   i wonder you ve the face to tell me euch fibs  cried the gardener to which bruno wisely replied oo dont want a face to tell fibs izonly a movf  bruno does not like snakes they are too waggly he is not  praticular but he likes  straight animals best he goes through his gardening most conscientiously carefully conforming to the rules of elfland being asked by the impersonal narrator what he is going to do with a dead mouse he has with him he answers  why its to measure with however would oo do a garden without one we make each bed three mouses and a half long and two mouses wide padding according to mr lewis carroll may be fitly defined as  that which all can write and none can read he does not absolutely affirm that there is none in the 395 pages in which the story of sylvie and bruno is told but does affirm that it is confined to a few lines here and there which have been inserted to eke out a page in order to bring a picture into its proper place he asks his readers to discover three lines of this kind which lurk in a passage extending from the top of p 35 to the middle of p 38 these three lines of padding however must either be undeserving of the epithet or there must be other bits of the same kind in the same pages else there would be no difficulty in disinterring them a free use of padding is however a charge that could never be brought against so gay and witty a writer as lewis carroll and if his definition be true proof will be given that padding is absent for sylvie and bruno is sure to be much

B5637,"['8961362', '6796996', '6830469']",  sister teresa new novels by george moore fisher unwin mb moore gave no hint if we mistake not in the first edition of  evelyn innes that he intended to write a sequel so that although there is no suggestion of it there is still a possibility that  sister teresa may be followed by a third volume to complete the tragedy of evelyn inness career the need certainly seems to arise for it for the end arrived at in sister teresa is distinctly a case of bathos it will be remembered that evelyn inns was j represented in the first book as a person in o whom sensuality and idealism were constantly struggling for the mastery and there the struggle was left undecided in sister teresa the struggle still goes on only to cease at the end not because any solution has been come to but because evelyn has been ill and she finds that she has not the physical courage to escape from the convent as she had meant to do and that she can do no more than settle down to an inert vegetable existence as a music mistress in a convent school a dead soulless existence is undoubtedly a frequent outcome of such a struggle as there was in evelyns nature but it is no solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great novel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a novel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are traces everywhere of a certain affectation of celticism mr moores recentlyfound celtic aspirations are of course notorious he has not succeeded in keeping them

underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore novelist

B8139,"['8517588', '8693422']",  the eustace diamonds the eustace diamonds by anthony trollope in three voomes chapman aod hall mr trollope has a place of his own and a very worthy place among novelists and moralists  and  the eustace diamonds  shows him at his best both as a moralist and asa novelist nearly all his men and women are wonderfully lifelike their characters and the incidents through which thosecharacters exhibit themselves are admirably portrayed and an excellent vein of satire genial yet searching in its way is shown in all his work the good sense that he always displays carries a moral that goes far beyond the ground to which his stories are apparently confined and perhaps without intending it certainly without weakening his books as mere works of fiction he uses them to preach very useful sermons on some of the follies and vices of the day in this respect 4the eustace diamonds is particularly noteworthy we do not know whether we have a right ta claim mr trollope as in aay way a supporter of the movement for improving the condition af women but if he is an unintentional ally his service is all the more valuable aad he could not possibly render better service than by his drawing of such characters as those el his two unheroic heroines in this novel lissie eustace and lucy morris lizzie shows cleverness that with scope given for its honest exercise would have made her as useful as she is clever but being poor aad having no other trade than marriage open to her she becomes only a becky sharp squanders all her wits and leads a very foolish and mischievous life lucy is as sweet and simple as a daisy but daisylike she runs a chance of being trampled down altogether and all because conventional restraints have made her unfit to hold her own against the stronger will and more selfish fancy of her lover frank greystock frank greystock the yet more unheroic hero is as useful as are the two young ladies in showing what poor sorts of persons are i produced by the orthodox arrangements of society and the unfortunate inequality of the sexes that now prevails and is as injurious to men as it is to women but the novel also points to other and kindred morals i within the figure and frame and clothes and cuticle within the bones and flesh of many of us there is but one persona man or woman with a preponderance either of good or evil whose conduct in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman such persons are simple single and perhaps generally safe they walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles and are today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow as they are today lady eustace was such a person and so was lucy morris opposite in their characters as two poles they were each of them a simple entity  and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman but there are human beingswho though of necessity single in body are dual in character in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good but to whom evil is sometimes horribly hideously evil but is sometimes also not hideous at all of such men it may be said that satan obtains an intermittent grasp from which when it is released the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble such menor women may hardly perhaps debase themselves with the more vulgar vices they will not be rogues or thieves or drunkardsor perhaps liars but ambition luxury selfindulgence pride and covetousness will get a hold of them and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices such a man waa freak greystock who could walk along the banks of the quiet troutgiving bob at bobsboroogb whipping the river with his rod telling himself that the world lost for tove would be a had thing well lost for a fine purpose  and who could also stand with his hands in his trousers pockets looking down upon the pavement in the purlieus of the courts of westminster and swear to himself that he would win the game let the cost to his heart be what it might what must a man be who would allow some undefined feeling some inward ache which he ealls a passion aad cannot analyse some desire which has come of instinct aad not of judgmentto interfere with all the projects of his intellect with all the work which he has laid out for his accomplishment circumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which indeed his meanswere insufficient but which he regarded as of all paths the noblest and the manliest if he could be true to himselfwith such truth as at these moments would seem to him to bethe truest truththere was nothing in rank nothing in ambition which might not be within his reach he might live with the highest the besteducated and the most beautiful he might assist ia directing national councils by his intelligence and might make a name for himself which should be remembered in his country and of which men would read the records in the histories written in after ages but to do this he must walk warily he an embarrassed man a man already in debt a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion was called upon to live and to live as though at his ease among those who had been bora te wealth and indeed he had so cleverly learned the ways of the wealthy that he hardly knew any longer how to live at his ease among the poor but had he walked warily when he went down to richmond and afterwards sitting alone in the obscurity of his chamber wrote the letter which bad made lucy morris so happy  the loves and pains the joys and struggles of these three persons form the basis of the plot of mr trollope  novel a diamond necklace furnishing the very ingenious thread on which it is strung in the prelude we learn that lizzie a poor orphan with good looks and spoilt talentt for her only fortune had succeeded in marrying lord eustace a rich and sickly youth and in causing him to die of a broken heart before a year was out when the detailed story begins she is trying to catch another husband by help of the fortune that she now possesses aa estate in scotland worth 4000 a year for life besides this however sha claims as her own property some splendid diamonds worth 10000 which the family solicitor regards as an heirloom that ought to ba given up for the benefit of her infant son when he suooeeds to the estate aad out of her greedy holding of these diamonds until they are stolen from her grow nearly all her troubles they cause her match with lord fawn to be broken off and bringing her into close intimacy with her cousin frank make her very anxious to form a match with him frank nearly yields to her fascinations and to the charm of her fortune and is accordingly very neglectful during more than two volumes of lucy morris the governess whom he really loves though he shrinks from marrying any one who has not some of the money that he sorely needs to help him on in his scheme of ambition nothing could be much better in its way than mr trollopes working out of frank greybtocks character shown in his flirtations with lizzie eustace in his honest lovemaking with lucy and in all his other actions throughout the book like persons goodhearted and even generous yet vacillating and in the main very selfish mr trollope has already described in great numbers but he always excels in this kind of portraiture and frank grey stock is equal to the best of his sort of course frank has enough distinguishing characteristics to justify his appearance in  the eustace diamonds and as long as such persons exist in real life and when will they cease to exist they can hardly be laughed at too often especially with such kindly laughter as slr trollope knows exactly how to arouse many of the minor persons in  the eustace diamonds are as carefully drawn as the principals especially lord fawn the dilletante undersecretary of state who regrets his engagement with lizzie very soon after it has been made yet is at his wits end to find some means of breaking it off without scandal and mrs carbuncle a very lively representative of the adventurous ladies who  get on in society until they are found out but why should we say much about a novel that so many

an obstacle in the shape of poverty hinders the felicity of mary bradford and the partner of her choice but that difficulty being surmounted by the bold expedient of a fortune being left to mr eden they attain the same successful consummation of their hopes as the halfdozen other couples who drag through three volumes the even tenor of their way with the exception of too copious a use of scraps of french and some eccentricities on the part of the printer there is positively nothing to object to in the  fitful fever of a life it is not at all feverish and perhaps a trifle hard to read but

that esop smith alias peter query alies martin farquhar tupper comes out most grandly one of his great charges against that press which with a few exceptions has failed to appreciate mr tupper is that its writers are anonymous let victim reputations take comfort in this that the scribe who has indicted such murderous leaders is a mere miserable envious unit and that his multitudinous readers only read him for amusement but believe him not the licence of the press is working its own cure forasmuch as nobody now thinks any the worse of any man but rather all the better for a fierce onslaught of the power usurped by sundry calumniators who are but the dlantons and b1irabeaux of our illused fourth estate if this be really mr tuppers opinion why complain  surely he has been calumniaute o enough

B5919,['8720648'],  the new republic or culture faith and philosophy in an english country house 2 vols chatto fc windus for more than half of the present century english society and english letters had the advantage of being reflected in a series of halffictitious halfsatirical writings to which hardly any previous parallel can be found from the days of stagecoaches to those of telegraphs from the time when the english gentleman devoted himself to madeira and barouche driving to that in which he took to laborious reading for honours and equally laborious lecturing on things in general these books extended they were written by a man of extensive scholarship of much knowledge of the world and of sufficiently clear and definite tastes to give him a position from which to look ont and to criticize they constantly introduced wellknown personageb and always wellknown ideas and hobbies both the personages and the ideas were frequently caricatured but the caricature was alway so artistically done that it was of more value than the dull fidelity of any number of photographs it was difficult sometimes to recognise coleridge in mr flosky and mr mystic scythrop and shelley were not always identifiable and mr feathernest was clearly a libel on southey but there was no mere parody and no mere misrepresention and these stories from  headlong hall to  gryll orange have therefore never lacked readers and admirers though there have sometimes been brisk young men of letters who have fondly imagined that they had  discovered  peacock this digressive beginning is pardonable because it is absolutely certain that no one will read the new republic without having  crotchet castle and the rest constantly in his mind and because the merits we have noticed in peacocks books are those the want of which will be chiefly felt in the author before us he has imagined we give the scheme of the book because it is not reprinted verbatim from the magazine in which it first appeared a saturday to monday party of londoners guested in a seaside villa which their host otho lawrence has inherited from a rich and intellectual but improper uncle the story if story there be goes no further and the contents of the book are expanded to two volumes first by the device not altogether copyright of having subjects for conversation written on the menu of the saturdays dinner and secondly by the institution of a sunday debating club to cany out the ideas thus started and to frame an utopia in the good old platonic fashion these conversations and debates fill np the whole space with the exception of a few pieces of description after the manner of a nineteenth century  minute philosopher all the interest centres in the characters who are no strangers there is mr herbert who has strikingly original ideas on art and ideas still more strikingly original on ethics and political economy mr luke who is equally enamoured of culture of conduct and of his own very peculiar ideas of christianity mr rose whose sentences are of a marvellous modulation and in whose mouth the name of botticelli is no stranger mr storks whom the physical basis of life knows mr stockton who has both spoken and heard of  the infinite azure and the rev dr jenkinson who has silvery hair is great upon plato and does not at all like to have it supposed that he is not equally great upon the new testament of less notorious personages or of personages with no notoriety at all there are several of whom the most prominent besides the host a wellmeaning but feeble young man who would like to have a mission if he knew how and lord allen a variety of the same species are mr saunders a very disagreeable youth in pink stockings with a profound disbelief in everything but himself and mr j s mill and mrs sinclair a poetess who combines an ethereal aspect with some vulgarity the conversations turn first on no less alarming a subject than the aim of life and the subsequentlyfounded utopia is intended to give expression on each speakers part to this ailsa in the pragma of the disxjurae the accuracy of parody it simply aatoniwhing there is probably not one educated reader in a hundred who on reading most of mr herberts speeches will not rack his brains to remember in whioh of certain wellknown and now not easily procurable volumes they occur the sermon which practically doses the book might very well have found a home between the drab covers which issue monthly from a certain kentish village  and a speech of mr roses at vol il p 179 really sets one wondering whether ones own copy of some studies on strongly ribbed paper which appeared four years ago is imperfect or not this is all very well but it does not need demonstration that the parodist element is one which bhould be kept to its place and that that place is a minor one a parody in two volumes is something of a monstrosity and one certainly tyres of such a pro longed concert with all parts sustained only by the mockingbird nor is this the only charge which must be brought against the book there are some touches in one character wbich cannot but be regarded as the gravest possible offences against good taste good manners and fair play it would be a repetition of the offence to particularise them here  and they are unfortunately not likely to escape the notice or it may be hoped the censure of any instructed reader a worse fault perhaps artistically though an infinitely more venial one in every other way is the absence of a foil to all taheee intellectual personages there is indeed a certain lady ambrose who is intended we suppose to supply this want but as she is a mere woman of the world with almost all the usual defects and less than the usual brains of the character the contrast is too glaring to be good or satisfactory we want to recur to peacock a dr opimian or a lady clorinda to give us a milieu of sense not wholly divorced from intellect the book is so clever a book despite its faults that it deserves criticism of the admonitory rather than the objurgatory kind we should have to go far before we found such a brilliant putting into words of the famous butlerian maxim as this conscience in most souls is like an english sovereign it reigns but it does not govern or such neat phrases ns the following  m a cynic is a kind of inverted confessor perktually niaking enemies for the sake of what he lows to be false  life is the preface to eternity  unfortunately it is a preface that we cannot skip and the dedication is generally made to the wrong person  the whole teachings of that school have always seemed to me nothing more than a few fragments of science imperfectly understood obscured by a few fragments of christianity imperfectly remembered  you forget said leslie that dr jenkinsons christianity is really a new firm trading under an old name and trying to purchase the goodwill of the former establishment  the chief good of the former nation germany

refuge in study snatching what time was possible from needlework and household duties she taught herself latin without even the help of a grammar using only some french translations and she tried to learn greek in the same way she read eagerly every work on philosophy science or history that came within her reach when she was twenty the first two books of montaignes essays appeared and she drank in their wit till she was fairly intoxicated in 1588 by good chance her mother took her from her native picardy to paris where montaigne was also lodging the eccentric maiden aged twentythree and by thirtytwo years his junior sent him word that she reverenced him and longed to be his friend not too famous to despise her humble praise be called upon her next day and at once to her great delight offered her the alliance and affection of a father to a daughter it was an odd relationship preserved during the four remaining years of montaignes life he left her an orphan when she was twentyseven and she lived to the age of eighty editing his works writing treatises in support of his teaching in proof of her own favourite dogma of the intellectual and moral equality between men and women she gained every year in popularity and eccentricity and in her old age devoted herself to the polite excesses of the pricieuses her earliest and only noteworthy book was the novel  le promenoir de i montaigne so called because she rehearsed it to her  adopted father while walking in his garden it is a tedious story of a persian princess betrothed to the king of parthia but who loves and is loved by a grecian youth their troubles her constancy and his treachery are detailed in full up to the moment when she procures her own murder and he stabs himself that he may fall into her grave from that starting point arose the french novel the first specimen was stiff and wearisome loaded with classical allusions and almost destitute of pathos or any sort of human sentiment hardly better though more famous was durfes  astrie begun twenty years later in 1610 and finished in 1825 it was an endless story of pastoral love and sorrow imitated from the italian novelists both works are to be remembered rather because of their influence upon those which came after than for any merit of their own the first woman of genius to be influenced was iadile de scudery like marie de gournay she was poor and selftaught besides gaining a marvellous intimacy with classical lore she learned dancing painting and music and to those attainments she added skill in agriculture cookery and medicine she took to authorship as a means of living and in hope of paying off some of the family debts and soon she became rish and famous few women have been more reverenced by their contemporaries and more neglected by posterity but who save miss kavanagh can have courage to read a novel in ten octavo volumes with thirteen hundred pages a piece professing to be all about ancient history but with its characters places and events made to fit the characters places and events of the writers day such was her igrand cyrus with louis the fourteenth for its cyrus and with praise or blame of every one she knew scattered through the work shorter than the  grand cyrus for it occupied only seven thousand pagesbut more wearisome in every other respect was the roman story of i clelie still shorter and in every way better was i ibrahim a turkish romance which preceded the classical and more ambitious novels it is true that madlie de scudirys works abound with pleasant episodes and are rich in delicate sentiment it may even be true as mis kavanagh says that she did more than any other writer of fiction to make the men of her country courteous and gentle and its women intellectual and refined but in her exaggeration of the bad models set before her she made her books unreadable to every generation after her own  if i were to invent a story said one of her heroines  i would make things much more perfect than they are all the women should be beautiful all the men as valiant as hector every one of my heroes killing at least a hundred men in every battle i would build palaces of precious stones every instant i would have prodigies and shipwrecks and conflagrations of cities and a thousand other things which give rise to fine lamentations and beautiful decriptions tnfinitly bettr wer maam dl

mtless warrios and mlaies with impouuible charms madame de la fayette peopled her tales with simple men and women and appealed to the living sympathies of her readers as the founder of a new sotle of fiction she fell into many errors and the life of her y was not true enough to make any copy of it highly attractive but boileau was right in setting her before evez other authoress in france of her heroines she heres was in great measure the type she was born in 1683 so that her life of sixty years was overlapped on both sides by the ninetyfour which madle de scudry needed for the writing of her

madame de suvignd4 the friend whom on her deathbed she acknowledged to have loved most in the worldwrote of her she is tired of saying good morning and  good evening she has fever every day and rest cures her but for all that she had seasons when it was pleasure to meet with a few chosen friends and when it was relief to write a few touching stories in them she seems to have spoken her own grief she had been married in youth to a husband who slighted her and when she was oldat thirtytwo she called herself quite oldshe became the friend of la rochefoucauld now a penitent prodigal why she questioned had they not ben friends before what might not their two lives have been could they have been blended into one her best years were spent in painfully gathering up the fragments of the happiness which she thought should have been he and to la rochefoucauld she came like a good angel to one dared to think ill of such a friendship as theirs nothing wrote madame de s6vign6  could be compared to it it was broken in 1680 when la roohefoucauld died madame do la fayette survived him thisteen years those years being largely spent in converse with the portroyalist teachers with whom she had been oft at heart all through her life that tale repeated and expanded in its heroines fictions in spite of its bad french sentiment is not without some grace very different but quite as necessary to be noted by the literary student is the life fof madame or madlle de tenein also reproduced in her writings a nun perforce and living in a dissolute age them may be some excuse for her dismal misuse of the wit and beauty with which she was endowed but her sins were too great to be forgiven the mother of dalembert the foundling was also the parent of what is emphaticly known as the

wrote novels are chosen by miss kavanagh as fair representatives of female work in english literature just as ten french novelists are made to illustrate the actions of women upon french literature in the work of which the supplement is now before us in a couple of volumes entitled enqjlish women of letters it is certainly curious to find aphra behn spoken of only as a novelist lady mary wortley montague not once mentioned and equal neglect shown to a crowd of other authoresses who if none of them hold a very prominent rank in the history of english literature are as worthy of notice in connexion with the subjects that they handled as are our female novelists in the literature of fiction as far as she goes however miss kava nagh is always interesting and fairly accurate the authoresses whom she describes serve well enough to show how far for the last two centuries and more women have contributed to the formation of the modern novel in english literature but they have been much lems influential even in that way than she imagines few will think with miss kavanagh that if swift and defoe were not novelists aphra behn is to be considered a writer of novels in  robinson crusoe and i gullivers travels there is infinitely more play of imagination variety of incident and real appreciation of humad character than in  oroonoko the history of the novel strictly so called begins with the man richardson and the man fielding but long before their time there were written romances similar to the  grand cyrus and other french works of the school of the precziuses according to forms popular in england from the date of sir philip sidneys  arcadia imitated and borrowed from by numberless authors and authoresses who made up for a paucity of human interest by distributing their eloquence over a larger space  oroonoko was better than these in that it gave a picture of real life but it is rather to be called a historical narrative adorned with fictitious details than a novel its authoress the daughter of a mr johnson of canterbury started for surinam with the rest of the family upon his being appointed lieutenantgeneral of the colony ihe died at sea but the widow and children completed the voyage and spent many years in the tropical home prepared for them after which aphra johnson  a handsome dark girl with a clear forehead fine eyes a full and merry mouth an animated though voluptuous coun3 tenance and a quick and ready tongue as miss kavanagh describes herreturned to be the pet of king a charles the second she amused him by an account of e surinam and obeyed his orders in writing out at length 1 the tragic history of its hero prince oroonoko the tale  is in keeping with nearly everything else that was written  to entertain the dissolute court but it also abounds in true ivigorous descriptions of nature in its most luxuriant and i picturesque aspect and has not a few rough vivid sketches i of character with all its faults it is entitled to a higher 1 place in the history of fiction than is commonly assigned i t it la aphra behn died in 1689 and sarah fielding was born d in 1714 oroonoko was published about 1665 and la david simple in 1744 between them appeared no twomans novel or novelist worth recording but the interval e was marked by important changes in the style and subject  of fictitious writing swift and defoe showed how keenly is the foibles and vices of mankind might be attacked by dsatire disguised in fiction and the portrait of sir itogger do re coverley is an admirable illustration of the character drawing which addison and steele did much to introduce 6 murray into english fiction richardson in 1741 wrote  pamela which with all its faults was a great advance upon  the pomp and parade of romancewriting from which it was written to warn young people and in 1742 fielding ridiculed the affectations into which also richardson himself had fallen and raised the true novelist to the level of the poet by his  joseph andrews fieldings sister writing g david simple two years later attempted to blend something of her brothers style with the mode of writing borrowed by le sage from the spanish novelists and thus to inculcate a morality foreign to the purpose of either her heroesfor nearly all the personages of the book are as much heroes as the one who gives it its name and equal care is taken in the delineation of all whether great or littleare as complete embodiments of virtues and vices as the characters in  pilgrims progress or the earlier works on which bunyan built his wonderful tale her merit lay as fielding said of her without exaggeration in a vast penetration into human nature a deep and profound discernment of all the mazes windings and labyrinths which perplex the heart of man to such a degree that he is himself often incapable of seeing through them david simple is a book that has dropped only by public oversight out of the high place due to it in the history of english fiction madame darblay however was for popularity and in respect of all small matters though utterly inferior in the highest forms of power a better novelist than sarah fielding miss kavanagh is right in regarding her as in some sort the mademoiselle de scudery of english literature in execution there is entire difference between  evelina and the  grand cyrus but their effects were similar each authoress strove diligently and skilfully to be clever and to make the novel not so much a means of moral teaching as a series of moral sketches from real life madame darblay drew her inspiration from fielding and emulated as far as she could his art of painting the world as it is but with true womanly instinct she chose only virtuous themes she liked to be humorous and satirical she had a keen sense of the ludicrous and took a pleasure in showing up the vulgarity coarseness insolence and pride of the men and women whom she saw around her but she was steadfast and unsparing in her denunciation of vice she showed her wisdom in painting only those parts of society that were well known to herself and miss kavanagh hardly exceeds the truth in saying that dno one has left us pictures so complete no one has drawn so distinctly classes of fashionable society of which all record has vanished save such as is to be found in her pages during her long life of eightytwo years she wrote but four novels and each consists of wonderfully minute sketches of external life of manners rather than character strung together with equal conscientiousness though with various artistic success her successor though dying seventeen years earlier was mrs radcliffe a novelist of a very different sort a woman of far more agreeable temperament gentle domestic and kindhearted to an unusual degree mrs radcliffe wrote tales that must have painfully shocked the authoress of cecilia and evelina born in 1764 and very scantily educated she was the daughter of a shopkeeper and at the age of twentythree she married the proprietor and editor of the english chronicle her husband soon found that besides personal beauty and wifely worth she had intellectual powers of a rare order he therefore urge4 her to write and after many refusals on the plea of inability she began to occupy the dull evenings during which his work took him from her with the production of a story soon her peculiar art attained such perfection that even her husband dared not read some of the chapters alone in the night time the tales were altogether unreal fashioned on the model of horace walpoles castle of otranto and vlara reeves  old english baron and of a sort that justified colmans ridicule a novel now is nothing more than an old castle and a creaking door a distant hovel clanking of chainsa gallerya lightold armourand a phantom all in white and thered a novel but in mrs radcliffes case under all the absurdities of horror there was a strange vein of sweetness as well as a marvellous aptitude in the description of both natural and architectural beauty thus she could write to the minds eye when sketching a church of which one window more perfect than the rest opened upon a long vista of the forebt through which was seen the rich colouring of evening melting by imperceptible gra dations into the solemn grey of upper air dark hills whose outline appeared distinct upon the vivid glow of the horizon closed the perspective several of the pillars which had once supported the roof remained the proud effigies of sinking greatness and seemed to nod at every murmur of the blast over the fragments of those that had fallen a little before them and mrs lladcliffe even when painting scenes that she had never visited was as accurate as she was graceful speaking of venice she described  its terraces crowned with airy yet i majestic fabrics touched as they now were with the splendour of the setting sun appearing as if they had been called up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter rather than reared by mortal hands  and the image was so true that byron writing on the spot felt it or stole it i stood in venice on the bridge of sighr a prison and a palace on each hand from out the waves i aw her structures rise as at the stroke of an enchanters wand in the course of eight years mrs radcliffe wrote her five novels they earned as much fame and money as she needed and she spent twentysix happy years of retirement from nearly all company save that of her husband the newspapers and biographical dictionaries announced her death in 1809 while by many it was reported that the exuberance of her own wild fancies had driven her mad and reference was made to the lunatic asylum in which she was supposed to have been confined she did not take the trouble to contradict either statement and lived on till the year 1823 mrs inchbald miss edgeworth min austin mr opie and lady morgan are the novelists of the present oentury portrayed by miss kavanagb most personal interest attaches to mrs inchbald the farmers daughter whom a strange eagerness to see the great world forced to run away from home and become an actress in spite of an impediment in her speech the friend of mrs siddons in the years when she was a washerwoman in the daytime and a tragic queen at night the successful playwriter who lived on eight shillings a week that thankless relatives might be supported and the widow of twentysix whom young men afterwards courted when she was twice as old as themselves but unquestionably the greatest of female novelists of england dead or living was miss austin of whom sir walter scott with characteristic generosity and in fair criticism wrote after reading  pride and prejudice for the third time that young lady had a talent for describing the involvement of feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful thing i ever met with the big bowwow strain i can myself do like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early  english women ofletters biographical sketches by julia kavanagh 2 vols hurst  blackett in her preface miss kavanagh says that this work on the english women of letters is the completion of the literary purpose she had in view when she wrote the  french women of letters the object being to show iioav far during the last two centuries and more women have contributed to the formation of the modern novel in the two great literatures of modern times the french and english she has only taken women who have founded a school of fiction and whose works have produced imitators typical avomen who have been the first in their own style the work comprises a biography of each authoress and an account and analysis of her principal novels tothis task miss kavanagh has brought knowledge of her subject delicacy of discrimination industry and a genial humour which makes her sketches pleasant to read miss kavanagh is too much occupied with her heroines to think about herself and this is the charm of her book it is talking over favourite books with a pleasant sympathising friend who whilst entering into the various characteristics and giving her own opinion very distinctly has yet the skill to avoid a dogmatic tone and all assumption of superiority she thoroughly sympathises with her authors and enters into the intention of their works with a clearness of understanding which is the greatest satisfaction an author can receive from a reader the  english women of letters comprises the lives and works of ten authoresses all avomen of renown in their day and generation the fashion of this world passes away alike in works of fiction as in all other respects works that delighted our grandmothers weary or scandalise their descendants who have their own avay of amusing themselves as they have of fashioning their clothes and dressing their hair if truth and nature will always endure they must take new aspects and combinations the great names in fiction dealt with in this book have already faded into the distance of tradition to be like miss austen to be like mrs radcliffe  or miss edgeworth is always a form of praise but there are many readers who have never found time to read their works for such these disquisitions will have a charm it is like having a story told with the warmth and vividness of the narrators personal interest in it instead of reading it aloud nothing is more fascinating than to make a friend acquainted with a favourite story or author and miss kavanagh excels in giving the pith and spirit of a story heraccount of all the novels she touches upon is as pleasant reading as anything ave haare met with for some time the first novelwriter on the list is no other than mrs aphra behn whose plays and novels at one time enjoyed great vogue and were capable of rousing remonstrance from the not too susceptible public of charles the seconds time what miss kavanagh had to do in that galley ave do not know and we think she had much better have left it alone from the testimony of responsible people it is known that mrs benns works dealt with things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme  that she passed permission in freedom of speech even in days of licence her mind says miss kavanagh  was tainted to the very core she loved grossness for its own sake because it was congenial to her she wrote dramas which though no worse than those of her contemporaries revolted the public as proceeding from a avoman the disgrace of aphra behn and of her pupils is that instead of raising man to womans moral standard they sank avoman to the level of mans coarseness the very men felt thislove of pleasure miss kavanagh owns to have been her master passion her second was love of literature after making these admissions miss kavanagh enters upon a warm defence of mrs aphra benns virtue  as if when a woman has allowed her thoughts to revel in profligacyher imagination to go upon the streets it signified to herself or anyone else whether she went there in person miss kavanagh gives a life of mrs behn an account of her novel of orinooko together with some descriptions of tropical scenery miss kavanagh claims for orinooko recognition as one of the first great works of english fictionone marking the dawn of that great english school of passion and nature of dramatic and pathetic incident which though last arisen and slowly developed has borrowed least and taught most it is true that for force and freshness the passages quoted are very remarkable and the story of orinooko as given by miss kavanagh beats  uncle tom out of the field for tragic interest and true pathos  but miss kavanagh would have done better to leave both novel and author where she found them in the mausoleum of the british museum aphra behn wasted her genius and profaned her gifts and men are perfectly willing that her name should die miss kavanagh revives the names of several other authors of repute in their day though the echo of the praises that followed them have become as silent as the acclamations of an old roman triumph sarah fielding the friend of richardson the sister of him who wrote  tom jones was highly thought of in her day and her novel of  david simple received praise from quarters that made it seem like fame it is a strictly moral story and is the beginning of those novels in which character is everything and incident is only used to develop characterwhere the human heart is probed in all its depths and followed in all its windings  david simple is however by miss kavanaghs own admission an extremely dull story and except as a literary curiosity lias no value or interest madame darblay and her novels are more talked of than read  so that miss kavanaghs account of her works may have the charm of novelty who has read mrs charlotte smiths old manor house heremmeline her ethelindaand yet all these made a sensation in their day like jane eyre and adam bede and she is the earliest representative of the modern domestic novel the chapters on mrs radcliffe and her novels are the best the criticism is just and the very best of the stories are given with a spirit and enthusiasm which will probably put some readers upon the endeavour to read the originals  an undertaking that needs the wild freshness of morning to enjoy the second volume comprises mrs inchbald to whose life we think miss kavanagh does not render justice  it is told in a hard halfdepreciatory style  but the account of the simple story is excellent for mrs inchbald miss kavanagh claims the great merit of being the first to substitute the essentially original imperfect and yet deeply interesting characters for the old conventional hero and heroine miss edgeworth and mrs opie follow as types of their own respective styles we endorse her high praise of miss edgeworth  but mrs opie with her fade and feeble sentimentality would be unendurable to modern readers miss austen is miss kavanaghs idol and ideal of excellence  she does justice to the others but mis austen she loves of miss austen she tells nothing new indeed the lamentable destruction of all her letters papers and journals by the stupid relative into whose hands they fell has swept away all private aud personal records of this woman so essentially a type of an english woman in the chapter on lady morgan miss kavanagh has been unfortunate amongst the many statements she makes hardly one is correct lady morgan used to complain of the various biographies that avere written of her by persons utterly ignorant about her miss kavanagh repeats the fiction that lady morgan was educated by a miss crowe a milliner as well as a teacher of youth lady morgan was very angry when that assertion first went out to the world for in fact her schooling was of the very best neither was her mother an actress but a avoman who held plays in detestation and was also a member of lady huntingdons connexion neither was lady morgan herself ever on the stage neither is the history of lady morgans father told according to facts he was never subagent and landsteavard to sir john broavne nor to any one else in short the avhole life is a tissue of mistakes better is the estimate of her stories though miss kavanagh criticises more and narrates less than in the other chapters where she treats of the works of her authors she has not the grasp of lady morgans mind and genius which was too quick and high and glancing to be seized and fastened with a critical corkingpin on the whole this work of miss kavanaghs will be a pleasant contribution to the literature of the times and in raising a shrine to the merits of some of the leading english women of literature miss kavanagh has also associated her own name with theirs,ovel_contra

B4514,['8719492'],  memoir of annie keary by her sister mac millan  co this story of a singularly sweet and beautiful life told simply and unassumingly by the only person who could tell it aright has a strange pathos the incidents in it are nothing there is little variety little that is tragic until the brave uncomplaining end  yet the life is intensely interesting the pathos lies not in the subject but in the fact that the life had to be written so early annie kearyshe was annie or aunt annie to all who knew her and somehow it was difficult to call her miss kearywas not in the least sad herself and though her quiet life had its sorrows and bitter trials it was rich in love she was not of a nature to be lonely her gentle character drew friends around her wherever she went and her friends never left her or ceased to feel the quickening power of her influence in wielding this influence she was happy and her chief joy was to work upon other natures to help them in doubt and difficulty to keep the ideal and spiritual life awake in thom whether as a motheraunt to her brothers children as a friend of workhouse girls a worker in hospitals among the poor in reformatories she is always the same sympathizing helpful guide the book is full of letters written to those whom she had befriended in their time of need and with whom a lifelong affection was the result as the reader peruses them he can understand in some degree the tender reverence which she inspired in people of all shades of character and mind none ever went to her with his troubles without coming away stronger to bear them and to have been her friend meant to many to have been lifted into a higher world there is a part that cannot be touched upon in a review which many will find more attractive than anything else in though volume this is not the place to enter into the earnest workings of a deeply religious spirit those who would knowhow one who was keenly open to intellectual argument met the altering phases of the last thirty years must read the memoir itself and when they have begun they will not stop at present we prefer to confine ourselves to the more public side of miss kearys life and see how the memoir bears upon her literary career it is interesting to notice that it was in a sober puritanical family life with its strictly kept sunday quakerlike plainness of costume and emptiness of all amusement its plan of trying to throw dishonour on the flesh and inculcation that  the next best thing to not having good looks was not knowing that you had them that annie keary like the brontes developed her imagination the chapter on her childhood is one of the most charming parts of the book  for the fairy tales and adventures in the land of fancy which have delighted two generations of children in blindmans holiday and other of her stories grew up out of the games and amusements of the playroom in a dull house at hull from earliest childhood annie keary was a storyteller she made the nursery a palacea kingdom as with a magicians wand there were days  when the higher powers would be taken away from the house by outside duties and the small domain would be untenanted save by the children and then there ensued a delicious time after racing for hours from hiding place to hiding place after seeing hearing feoling escaping from such dangers as those of the den of thieves  after the excitement of long blindfolded journeys to magic land and of actual contact with the wonders there grownup people and nurses might talk as they pleased might call things by commonplace names might scold and trouble and fuss but they could not rob us of the knowledge of the truth they could not shut us up in the prison world from which we had had such escape not for many many days at least when this creator of magic land for herself and her brothers and sisters grew up she began to tell and write the same delightfully mysterious fancies for other children it was for her nephews and nieces that most of her early tales were written and these childrens books were among her most successful achievements the cause of her success was simple she loved children and thus she came to know them well at her brothers house in staffordshire  everything she did was inspired by or turned towards what was the centre of her lifeher care of the children whatever new thing she learned of bird or insect or flower whatever beauty she discovered in written book or living action she took straight to them as a motherbird carries treasure to her nest all changes of the hours every season of the year she set and turned to the requirements of nursery life  in summer time the little garden and the field the banks of the canal close by the bluebell woods further away had each their changing pleasures the nursery nay the whole house in winter afternoons and in the evening fireglow were no less the inspirers of games or quaint weird fairy tales some of the prettiest of her childrens fairy tales  little wanderlin amongst them were written for that nursery in writing it was always necessary for her to realise her hearers and she never gave shape to her fancies more pleasurably than she did when fashioning for that one childaudience she loved so well that necessity of  realising her hearers applies to her later and larger writings she did not take seriously to literature till she was past thirty when the sorrow of leaving the home in trent vale and the death of her father and two favourite brothers had thrown her back upon herself  the first shaping of her tales was especially a happiness to her the nucleus of these was always some little cluster of persons whom she suddenly seemed to find in her mind and who as she lived in thought with them became more clearly known to her whose natures unfolded themselves as regularly according to some inward law as a flower blossoms and a fruit reaches its perfection tales were never suggested to her by events it was always character that developed plot and it never seemed to her as if she invented characters she used to say that her heroes and heroines were quite alive and real and that they spoke and acted of themselves independently of her control as long as any tale was upon the stocks she lived in it with a bort of double life which kept her as only imagination can keep people from the narrowing effects of routine or the roughening of little daily cares she wrote anywherein the midst of talk at a bedside never in a place apart yet  the act of expression was often a great effort to her  she used to say it took her twice as long and wasted twice as much of her force as it need have done because of a certain slowness of mind which her early habit of living in dreams that lead to no result had engendered still she wrote  doggedly on on her bad days as well as her good days and was happy or unhappy according as the day was fruitful or not the pleasure of writing outweighed the pain but when the book was finished there came a reactionthere seemed to be  something startlingly prosaic in the work done compared with the doing of it and besides the ideal companions of many happy weeks or months had suddenly departed and then came the ordeal of the reviews  she never got enough used to little rubs against the world not to suffer by them even the seeing of her own name in print was something of an annoyance to her and she never got over an absolute dread of reading a review annie keary was ever too diffident and selfmistrustful castle daly her best novel though she curiously disliked writing it and was surprised at its success first gave her confidence and we can trace the result in the firm hand which drew the characters of  a doubting heart her last book the actors in these and her other novels may be traced in real life in the memoir and the charming scenes in the south of france which we meet in  a doubting heart are reproduced in some delightful letters from pegomas we can only refer to the egyptian letters which are full of faithful yet imaginative pictures and show the wakeful observant eye that is apparent not only in the book she afterwards published the  early egyptian history but in all her works there is only one fault to find with the memoir and that is that there is not enough mention of the writer miss eliza keary has studiously ignored the large part she herself played in her sisters life in another biographer selfeffacement might be a virtue but in this instance the omission of almost all reference to the narrator takes away from the completeness of the narrative,ovel_contra

never knowing that they had succeeded to praise a child for any precocious faculty or personal grace is a sure way to deprive it of its charm and men are but children of a larger growth when all has been said that can be said about nipping genius in the bud the fact remains that literature has lost at least as much by cordial recognition as by stupid indifference with all his enormous resources

to be delivered from the hands of favourable reviewers colonel lockhart is not now a beginner in novel writing so that we need not disguise the pleasure with which we have read his last production from any fear of stopping the supply he has had no inconsiderable share of praise but he has passed through the ordeal unscathed  mine is thine so far from being a falling off from his previous works is an advance upon them profiting by experience and exercise colonel lockhart has knit the parts of his story more firmly together and the qualities which made fair to see so enjoyablethe fresh exuberant humour the firm grasp of character the unaffected sympathy with romantic passion the exhilarating description of life in the open air show no signs of having lost their edge his hand has gained in cunning and none of his natural force is abated at the beginning of the third volume one almost wishes that colonel lockhart had been content to wind up the story in two volumes he begins there to raise a suspicion that the remainder of the novel is to be a political treatise consisting mainly of an exposition of the principles of moderate conservatism in which his hero found a career even if we had not had little sympathy with the creed expounded we imagine we should have looked upon this plunge into politics in a novel of which the main interest is not political as an unprofitable deviation but the dull interval does not last long after some chapters of commonplace when the reader feels inclined to throw down the book as containing no incident that he could not guess without reafding it and no reflection that he has not heard before a new subject of interest is suddenly started and curiosity is kept on the alert and the sense of hunmour agreeably titillated

B3794,['8648846'],  the professor at the breakfasttable  with the story of iris by oliver wendell holmes ticknor  fields london low  co prenticeana or wit and humour in paro graphs by the editor of the louisville journal new york derby  jackson london low  co miss martineau characterised american con versation as prosy rich and droll we i int have been reminded of her epithets by the i to professors welcome book dr holmes i holds a high place in the light literature of  america he is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists there is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what mrs j da pringle in gaits  ayrshire legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent with all this the story of iris approves dr holmes to be an american writerthe number of mysterious girls who figure in transatlantic fiction is appalling such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke  iris is j ei the una of the boardinghouse iu which the scene i  of this volume is laiddr holmes in an jl imaginary character describing himself as also j  a dweller in one of those household societies j  which so far as we can read the riddle imply  companionship without affinityintimacywith i 8 no real confidence besides the mystery of 18  iris  who keeps a book tight locked j b which contains some very pleasant verse as  g we shall show his boardinghouse contains t a more dismal curiositya deformed man  b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 eanions in the house yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the i  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  john the young man john asked me to come up one day and try some old burbon which lc he said was al on asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that i shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way i followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking i might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity mighty close quarters they were where the young man john bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  barnum presenting

the end of the statement do i look as if id lost much flesh  bid heanswering my question by another no aid ifor that matter i think you do credit to the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board the sentence in quotationmarks was from one of those dis interested editorials in small type which i suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landladys and paid for as an advertisement   it ant the feedsaid the young man johnits the old womans looks when a fellah lays it in too strong the feeds well enough after geese have got tough  turkeys have got strong v lambs got old n veals pretty nigh beef n sparragrasss growin tall n shm n scattery about the head n green peas are gettin so big n hard theyd be dangerous if you fired em out of a revolver we get hold of all them delicacies of the season but its too much like feedin on live folks and devourin widdahs substance to lay yourself out in the eatin way when a fellahs as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one n not enough for two i cant help lookin at the old woman cornedbeefdays shes tolerable calm roastindays she worries some n keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves but when theres anything in the poultry line it reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin into the breast and joints comin to pieces that theres no comfort in eatin when i cut up an old fowl and help the boarders i always feel as if i ought to say wont you have a slice of widdahinstead of chicken the young man john fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being a 1 under j the influence of the crackers and sausage he grew  cordial and communicative it was time i thought j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had i excited my curiosity what do you think of our young irisi

particular to her that i remember but1 dont know whether it was the cracker and sausage or that the young fellows feet were treading on the hot ashes 1 i of some longing that had not had time to cool b j but his eye glistened aa he stopped i suppose she s i wouldnt have looked at a fellah like mehe said t i but i come pretty near tryin if she had said  yes though i shouldnt have known what to do

for themexcept once a yearon fastday and marryin ant for them sometimes a fellah feels lonely and would like to have a nice young woman to tell her how lonely he feels and sometimes a fellah here the young man john looked very confidential and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything it makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt and its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money we return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the professors speculations on the same these if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of dr holmes when he is bent on philosophising   i have never yet crossed the threshold of the little gentlemans chamber how he lives when he once gets within it i can only guess his horns are late as i have said  often on waking late in the night i see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite if the times of witchcraft were not over i should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then occasionally i hear very sweet bttains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem i have often tried to find out but through the partition i could not be quite sure if i have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing i have heard sounds so like them thati am a fool to confess iti have covered my head with the bedclothes for i have had a fancy in my dreams that i could hardly shake off when i woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the little gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain of course you dont suppose that i have any foolish superstitions about the matteri the professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead it is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies a man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much on the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary november evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it he doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images it is not what we believe as i said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive a principle that reaches a good way if i am not mistaken here are some verses out of the book of  iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic under the violets her hands are cold her face is white no more her pulses come and go her eyes arc shut to life and light fold the white vesture snow on snow and lay her where the violets blow but not beneath a graven stone to plead for tears with alien eyes a slender cross of wood alone bhall say that here a maiden lies in peace beneath the peaceful skies and grey old trees of hugest limb shall wheel their circling shadows round to make the scorching sunlight dim that drinks the greenness from the ground and drop their dead leaves on her mound when oer their boughs the squirrels run and through their leaves the robins call and ripening in the autumn sun the acorns and the chestnuts fall doubt not that she will heed them all for her the morning choir shall sing its matins from the branches high and every minstrelvoice of spring that trills beneath the april sky shall greet her with its earliest cry when turning round their dialtrack eastward the lengthening shadows pass her little mourners clad in black the crickets sliding through the grass shall pipe for her an evening mau at last the rootlets of the trees shall and the prison where she lies and bear the buried dust they seize in leaves and blossoms to the skies so may the soul that warmed it rise if any born of kindlier blood should ask what maiden lies below say only this a tender bud that tried to blossom in the snow lies withered where the violets blow a fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round though breakfast  table of the transatlantic mrs todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse the book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain mr prentice is a humorist of a different kind from dr holmes he is a painfully diffident american editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty for something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals he has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men some of them he says made the louisville journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature one merit of the collection in mr prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity american museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the yankee yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of george frederick cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of prentices head and its contents when he was young of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings prenticeyorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing the world had its menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed nowadays the initiation has been made in the states for a man to read his own ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic figaro  que les gens desprit sont betes i in all the anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine the flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest not of these are the prentice sayings they were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former thus mr prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning he maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august louisville olympus  to express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes i have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest mr prentices own description will thus best characterise the manner of his wit give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  this process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the guepes of m alphonso karr bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master the following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith here are halfadozen of the smart things which the author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  the editor of theasks if he shall write our life exactly as he pleases perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  the louisville democrat announces the melancholy fact that gen cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  a lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  the earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  an editor in the west boasts that his enemies will find him  a young david

upon your own tombs than upon washingtons  we know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds the playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   yesterday the junior editor of the democrat called upon the senior editor of the journal to welcome him back to kentucky the senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  to sit in to tumble out of which he did without an effort no bones broken andmatters compromisedlouisville democrat well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon if you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down these folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  the editor of the new hampshire patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire the editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less we believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges he prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  the editor of the souuiern democrat wants to know what makes us so smart if we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it a democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down no doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well the subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit an english paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the princess royal of england on her late weddingday we are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not the richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either there are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the

B8140,['4363494'],  reviews of books rachel ray mr trollope is one of the few novelists who make us forget the labour of criticism in our enjoymient of their books he throws off his novels with the ease of a man writing to some friend the latest gossip of his circle and seems as much amused with the foibles and humours of his characters as if he were laugghing at persons he had seen and heard and not at the creatures of his imagination this characteristic of his writing he has nowhere displayed more strikingly than in the novel before us it is almost a laugh from beginning to end marked here and there with touches of pathos effectively thrown in and though at times verging on caricature only violating the truth of nature to the extent of a slight exaggeration without plot and almost without incident we are carried through the book by the writers exuberant spirits and his way of turning to us the quizzical side of his characters but still more by the power with which he realises the manners the habits and speech of english life in their homeliest garb they are real beings who play their part in his story we have met them have spoken and lived with them we have sat with them in their houses have walked with them over the fields watched with them the setting sun by the churchyard stile and shared their loves and jealousies their weaknesses and their virtues we have seen before this cottage interior with its halfdozen books with gilt leaves arranged in shapes on the small round table where also is deposited the spangled mat of wondrous brightness made of short white sticks of glhss strung together with its shells and china figures on the chimneypiece the birdcage without a bird the old sofa the old armchair and carpet and the old round mirror over the fireplace we have some experience of mrs tappitts nianceuvres to convert a teaparty into a ball and win her lord and master by beautifully fine degrees to consent to one expense after another till the accumulation involves as an absolute necessity a still further outlay for which he is to be consoled by one of her best beefsteak puddings and who that has not been buried all his life in unredeemed bricks and mortar has not met mrs sturt the farmers wife who likes a young man who does the thing thats honest and is willing to lend her friendly aid to bring two young people together again who have been separated by the stupid interference of soured or silly meddlers  with such traits does  rachel ray abound and if it is not to be ranked though we doubt this with mr trollopes best works he has written nothing which will give his readers more thorough delight the design of his tale is to show how excessively mischievous overgood people may make themselves and that there is a practical malignity even about religion itself when it is pushed to an unnatural extreme with this view mr trollope begins by placing before us a lady very good and very weak whom he describes as one of those women who cannot grow alone as standard trees but for whom the support and warmth of some wall some paling some post is absolutely necessary who in their growth will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach while he lived mrs ray leaned upon her husband but on his death leaving her with two daughters the eldest of whom dorothea took after her father and was stem sober and steady the widow  immediately married herself to this girl who became thenceforth the prop against which she could grow but in time dorothea shared and became widow prime at the end of a year returning at the end of that time to her mothers cottage  black and stiff and stern to be her mothers prop once more mr trollope describes this womans character with great gusto prim and tidy by nature  it seemed that her peculiar ideas of duty required her to militate against her nature and education at any rate in appearance therefore she was rough with weeds her caps were  lumpy heavy full of woe and clean only as decency might requirenot nicely clean with feminine care her dress too was rough and black and clingingdisagreeable to the eye in its shape as will always be the dress of any wcmin which is worn day after day

of her younger daughter rachel who was neither weak nor stern but willing to take such pleasure as life offered her disliked mrs primes dorcas meetings and displayed  a little wickedness now and then to the extent perhaps of a vain walk into baslehurst on a summer evening a little obstinacy in refusing to explain whither she had been and whom she had seen a yawn in church or a word of complaint as to the length of the second sunday sermon the reader soon finds that in one of her walks rachel has seen  a young man this fact explodes like a bombshell in the cottap at braggs end and mrs ray holding the lupine theory with regard to youths of the opposite sex we see that what with her timidity on this score and mrs primes uncompromising enmity to happi ness of any kind rachers relations with the  young man from the brewery will be as little pleasant as it is possible for the two widows to make them but luke rowan the wolf in question is a youth of strong decision of character he has made up his mind to love rachel and that rachel shall love him which the girl is willing enough to do the day after mrs tappitts ball luke finds his way to braggs end and startles mrs rays confidence in her theory by the frankness with which he confesses his love and asks permission to visit rachel but above all by the way in which he takes his tea quite like a steady young man indeed she says defending herself against mrs primes remonstrances  he drank three large cups and if as rachel says he alajoes  to church regularly i dont know why we are to judge him anw say that hes anything out of the way the bickerings between mrs ray and her eldest daughter on this subject are described with the nicest discrimination of character and with an undercurrent of great humouir what is a higher testimony to mr trollopes power is the skill with which he develops rachels character in t conflict between the widows and the touches of purely natural and beautiful emotion by which he wins us to love her the dialogue between rachel and mrs ray after mrs prime has left them in which the girl tries to draw from her mother what luke has sai about her while she ran over to the farmers to fetch cream for the tea is one of the most charming of the many exquisite passages m these volumes mrs ray  so inconsequent in her mental workings so shandypated that it did not occur to her that an entirely new view of luke rowans purposes had been exposed to rach during this visit of mrs primes and not realising the fact that she had authorised rachel to regard luke as her lover while rachel remembers every word and begins to think that with hex mothers leave an intimacy with luke would be very pleasant but what was it that he did say mamma 9that is if you dow think it wrong to tell me i hardly know but i dont snppose it can be wrong for no young man could have spoken nicer and it made me happy to hear himso it did for the moment oh mamma do tell me and rachel kneeled down before her  wellhe said you were the nicest girl he had ever seen did he mamma and the girl clng closer to her mother a she heard the pleasant words but i oughtnt to tell you such nonsense as that and then 1h said that he wanted to come out here and see you andandand it is simply this that he meant to ask you to be his sweeheart if i would let him   and what did you say mamma  i couldnt eay anything because you came back bat you told dolly  mrs prime that you would be glad to ae him whenever he might choose to come here did i yes you said he was welcome to come whenever he plemb and that you believed him to be a very good young man and so i do why should he be anything else  i dont say that hes anything else but mamma well my dear what shall i say to him if he does ask me that question  h has called me by my name two or three times and spoken to me m though he wanted me to like him if he does say anything to like that what shall i answer    if you think you dont like him well enough you must toll him so of course c yes of course i must then rachel was silent for a mia or two she had not as yet received the full answer which o desired in such an alternative as that which her mother had southwest gested we may say that she would have known how to frame b answer to the young man without any advice from her mother bo there was another alternative as to which she thought it

slight sketches though they are the interview between mrs tappitt mrs rowan and mrs ray when the two former ladies visit the widow to represent to her the impropriety of a marriage between luke and rachel is again a proof of the ability with which the author holds his characters in hand and brings out their several idiosyncracies but perhaps the best thing in the novel is the pertinacity with which luke rowan deterniines either to drive old tappitt out of the brewery or compel him to brew good beer though it was a sour and muddy stream that flowed from his vats a beverage disagreeable to the palate and very cold and uncomfortable to the stonach tappitt made fifteen hundred a year out of it and to be told by a youngster that he did not know how to brew good beer was an indignity he could not put up with but the choleric old brewer is no match for luke cool and resolute at all hazards to brew good beer for baslehurst even if he is obliged to build a new brewery he threatens to do this and goes so far as to purchase the requisite ground then mrs tappitt seeing ruin staring her and her dauighters in the face urges her husband to take the thousand per annuim which luke has offered him in exchange for his interest in the old firm  till after much resistance and many resolutions to fight the battle out tappitt comes home from the dragon one night much the worse from eating  that accursed fish  and the next day sick in stomach and racked with headache lies utterly at his wifes mercy and consents to take lukes offer the scene in which this occurs is a capital domestic interior in mr trollopes best style if we are to find fault with this delightful story we might object that the artifice by which the stream of rachels love is disturbed is improbable that her mother would have been advised to make her write the letter which for a time clouds her joy and makes it doubtful whether the lover who broke in on her almost solitary and very humble life with such a sunburst of undreamt of happinessadvised too by the clergyman who had given such a sensible judgement on the question whether it would be sinful if she went to mrstappitts ballis notwethink likely that lovingluke as she did she would write it is less probable for rachel has a will of her own but that lukehonest straightforward manly lover as he isshould be put off by it should not feel the love that throbs under its air of prudence and attribute the love to rachel and the prudence to her stupid counsellors is less likely still but as this letter gives us two volumes when but for it we could only have had one we shall not quarrel with it and after all nothing is so flexible as human nature and to say that it will do this or will not do that under given circumstances is to forget how often it acts in contradiction to itself and again how often acts that seem to be contradiction on the surface are logical enough if we could minutely weigh the feelings from which they

B3660,"['6252765', '8640526']",  transformation or the romance of monte beni by natl a niel hawthorne 3 vols smith  eldersince the publication of his last work seven years ago mr hawthorne has spent some time in rome where the scenes of  transformation  are almost exclusively laid judging from internal evidence we should conclude that his visit to the eternal city was very short limited probably to two or three winter or early spring months and of course including the carnival although the book is full of rome and of art the authors acquaintance with either is evidently superficial of italian rome he knows nothing of rome in summer he knows nothing of society and even of that curious phase of society exhibited by the  artist life  in rome he knows little or nothing it is true that none of those subjects fall specially within the scope of his book but any one who has lived long in rome and penetrated however slightly within the barriers of galleries and studios must have shown some glimpses of the knowledge he would thus acquire for which we look in vain through the three volumes of  transformation every thing told us about the city itself might have been gathered during a few weeks perambulation of its streets under the charge of a clever cicerone or with the perhaps more intelligent companionship of a guidebook and as for art mr hawthornes treatment is very simple he takes some of the most celebrated works guidos  beatrice cenci  archangel michael or the  cleopatra and makes studies of them though not with the sympathies of a pictorial but those of a rhapsodical artist in other respect also his sympathies are singularly narrow and national that the personages of his fiction when anglosaxon it alleven to the anonymous priest who crosses the storyshould be american or as the author prefers to call them new englanders is excusable enough he has the most perfect right to select his characters from his fellowcountrymen but that every modern work of art which he mentions with eulogy should be the production of new england genius while the only old english name introduced is that of gibson brought forward solely to controvert that artists wellknown theory of tinted statuary shows a narrow exclusiveness of mind which we did not expect to find in mr hawthorne the chief excellence of the book lies in its descriptive passage mr hawthorne has a quick eye for scenery natural or architectural with a vivid style and ready command of pictorial language which euable him to describe with force and felicity his enthusiasm for antiquity and art is also genuine though somewhat spasmodic as a work of fiction  transformation with its scanty incident its unsolved mystery and its inconclusive conclusion will hardly satisfy the english novelreader the story more a mystery than a horror would seem to have been founded upon that remarkable legend mentioned in  coningsby of the highly respectable county family of featherstonehaugh who for several generations had been distinguished by the strange and humiliating peculiarity of being born with sheeps tailsa fact which they had kept secret for generations but at length they took decided measures to get rid of this inconvenient appendage so  transformation  represents first the peculiarity and then the change which befalls a certain donatello count of monte beni who was born to long furry ears like a faun at his first introduction to the reader donatello is standing by the faun of praxiteles and some artist friends comment upon the resemblance between the man and the statue not only in external likeness but also in character  no faun in arcadia says one of them  was ever a greater simpleton than donatello he has hardly a mans share of wit small as that is it is a pity that there are no longer any of this congenial race of rustic creatures for him to consort with the resemblance is afterwards worked out with much skill and gracefulness marred only by incessant references to donatellos strange reluctance to show his ears on this lighthearted halfwitted and irresponsible creature a total change is effected by the perpetration of a hideous crime the agent of his transformation is called miriam who seems to have dispensed with any other name a being of course endowed with surpassing beauty who lives in a studio and is a mystery she is persecuted by a most disreputablelooking old man who claims to possess some secret by which he is enabled to control her destiny his name is never told nor his secret revealed and the whole idea has been oftenand we must add much betterworked out in the london journal and other penny periodicals donatello who has become attached to miriam gets provoked by the reiterated appearances of her persecutor always at inopportune moments and at length takes an opportunity of tumbling him over the tarpeian rock the revulsion caused by this crime transoms him from a halfwitted lighthearted faun to a responsible but melancholy man a strange and uncomfortable sort of connexion then springs up between the pair whom this murder has joined together and their final fate is left in impenetrable mystery miriam throughout the btory has nothing womanlike about her she resembles rather what the old demonologiets termed a  succubus and is last seen tossing her arms wildly about in the pantheon of donatellos

solitary perfection in works of genius the yew and the locusttree have different natural habits then for one to whom all europe is looking for a part of its pleasure to stop the course of his labours

masters of cabinet  painting whom it would be wise to commission to cover a ceiling are not many raphael could produce the pitti ezekiel and the cartoons it is true rembrandt could paint the temple scene in jerusalem which england possesses as also the gigantic duke of gueldres in the berlin gallery  but raphaels and rembrandts are few it is only fit fair and friendly that the above three considerations should be allowed their full weight in adjudging the merit of mr hawthornes fourth and longest work of fiction produced after the pause of many years it would be idle to appeal to them were the production which calls them forth not a remarkable oneone of the most remarkable novels that 1860 is likely to give us whether from english french or american sources such an italian tale we have not had since herr andersen wrote his  improvisatore how potent is the spell of the south as filling the memories and quickening the imagination of the stranger how powerless over her own strongest sons in literary works of art and fancy we have occasion to see almost as often as we take up an italian novel mr hawthorne has drunk in the spirit ofitalian beauty at every pore the scene of this romance is principally at rome and the writers intense yearning to reproduce and accumulate his recollections of that wonderful city appears to have again and again possessed itself of heart and pen to the suspense not damage of his story who would object to avait for the progress of passion and the development of mystery on being beckoned aside into such a land of rich and melancholy enchantment as is disclosed in the folloaving exquisite picture of the borghese gardens  the entrance to these grounds as all my readers know for everybody nowa days has been in rome is just outside of the porta del popolo passing beneath that not very impressive specimen of michael angelos architecture a minutes walk will transport the visitor from the small uneasy lava atones of the roman pavement into broad gravelled carriagedrives whence a little farther stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful seclusion a seclusion but seldom a solitude for priest noble and populace stranger and native all who breathe the roman air find free admission and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the daydream that they call life   the scenery amid which the youth now strayed was such as arrays itself in the imagination when we read the beautiful old myths and fancy a brighter sky a softer turf a more picturesque arrangement of venerable trees than we find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the western world the ilextrees southeast ancient and timehonoured were they seemed to have lived for ages undisturbed and to feel no dread of profanation by the axe any more than overthrow by the thunderstroke it had already passed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few years ago they were grievously imperilled by the gauls last assault upon the walls of rome as if confident in the long peace of their lifetime they assumed attitudes of indolent repose they leaned over the green turf in ponderous grace throwing abroad their great branches without danger of interfering with other trees though other majestic trees grew near enough for dignified society but too distant for constraint never was there a more venerable quietude than that which slept among their sheltering boughs never a sweeter sunshine than that now gladdening the gentle bloom which these leafy patriarchs strove to diffuse over the swelling and subsiding lawns in other portions of the grounds the stonepines lifted their dense clump of branches upon a slender length of stem so high that they looked like green islands in the air flinging down a shadow upon the turf so far off that you hardly knew which tree had made it again there were avenues of cypress resembling dark flames of huge funeral candles which spread dusk and twilight round about them instead of cheerful radiance the more open spots were all abloom even so early in the season with anemones of wondrous size both white and rosecoloured and violets that betrayed themselves by their rich fragrance even if their blue eyes failed to meet your own daisies too were abundant but larger than the modest little english flower and therefore of small account these wooded and flowery lawnb are more beautiful than the finest of english parkscenery more touching more impressive through the neglect that leaves nature bo much to her own avays and methods since man seldom interferes with her she sets to work in her own quiet way and makes herself at home there is enough of human care it is true bestowed long ago and still bestowed to prevent wildness from groaving into deformity and the result is an ideal landscape a woodland scene that seems to have been projected out of a poets mind if the ancient faun were other than a mere creation of old poetry and could have reappeared anywhere it must have been in such a scene as this in the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into marble basins the depths of which are shaggy with waterweeds  or they tumble like natural cascades from rock to rock sending their murmur afar to make the quiet and silence more appreciable scattered here and there with careless artifice stand old altars bearing roman inscriptions statues grey with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere half hide and half reveal themselves high on pedestals or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf terminal figures columns of marble or granite porticoes arches are seen in the vistas of the woodpaths either veritable relics of antiquity or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on them that they are better than if really antique at all events grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars and weeds and flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of temples and clamber at large over their pediments as if this were the thousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there what a strange ideawhat a needless labourto construct artificial ruins in rome the nativesoil ofruin buteventhesesportiveimitations wrought by man in emulation of what time has done to temples and palaces are perhaps centuries old and beginning as illusions have grown to be venerable in sober earnest the result of all is a scene pensive lovely dreamlike enjoyable and sad such as is to be found nowhere save in these princely villaresidences in the neighbourhood of rome a scene that must have required generations and ages during which growth decay and mans intelligence wrought kindly together to render it so gently wild as we behold it now the final charm is bestowed by the malaria there is a piercing thrilling delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty thrown away or only enjoyable at its halfdevelopment in winter and early spring and never to be dwelled amongst as the homescenery of any human being for if you come hither in summer and stray through these glades in the golden sunset fever walks arminarm with you and death awaits you at the end of the dim vista thus the scene is like eden in its loveliness like eden too in the fatal spell that removes it beyond the scope of mans actual possessions in other pages the catacombs of st calixtus the tarpeian rock the pantheon no less poetically and richly frame scenes of a passion and wild interest in harmony with their beauty most of all do we enjoy mr hawthornes sympathy with the worlds cathedral st peters having rebelled for years against the bigotry with which sticklers for pointed arches or unlearned constructions have decried this gorgeous centre of the roman catholic rite as a place mundane theatrical and out of style for such censors art nature and beauty have no existence save by the complacent favour of their own vanity we have inadvertently touched on the great scenic power and beauty of this italian romance ere offering a word on its matter and argument whether the elevating influences of remorse on certain natures have ever been taken as the theme of a story so fearlessly as here may be questioned casuists and moralists must discuss the truth of the data to mr hawthorne truth always seems to arrive through the medium of his imaginationsome faroff fantasy to suggest a train of thought and circumstance out of which philosophies are evolved and characters grow his hero the count of monte beni would never have lived had not the faun of praxiteles stirred the authors admiration and this mythical creature so engaged the dreamers mind that he draws out of the past the fancy of an old family endowed with certain constant attributes of sylvan gaiety and careless semianimal enjoyments such as belonged to the dances and sunshine of arcady such is donatello at the beginning of the tale and with these qualities are mixed up unquestioning simple love and fidelity which can take a form of unreasoning animal fury in a moment of emergency he is hurried into sudden murder for thesake of the woman he loves and with that the faun nature dies out and the sad consciencestricken human being begins in the writhings of pain to think to feellastly to aspire this in a few words is the meaning of  transformation and for the first moiety of the romance the story tums slowly with windings clearly to be traced yet poaverfully round its principal figure the other characters mr hawthorne must bear to be told are not new to a tale of his miriam the mysterious with her hideous tormentor was indicated in the zenobia of the blithedale romancehilda the pure and innocent is own cousin to phoebe in the house of the seven gableskenyon the sculptor though carefully wrought out is a stone image with little that appeals to our experience of men these are all the characters and when it is added that miriam is a magnificent paintress with a mystery that hilda is a copyist of pictures from new england and that kenyon is her countryman enough has been told to define the brain creatures who figure in the avild  romance of monte beni mr haavthorne must be reckoned aith for the second moiety of his book in spite of the delicious italian pictures noble speculations and snatches of arresting incident which it contains we knoav of little in romance more inconclusiae and hazy than the manner in which the tale is brought to its close hints will not suffice to satisfy interest which has been excited to voracity every incident need not lead to a mathematical conclusion nor coup de thcutrc as in the comedies of m scribe but the

remind our readers that although the scene of the tale is fairyland still that fairyland lies in tilgate forest a part of sussex with which mr lemon was familiar on account of his lonf residence within a drive of its outskirts we will not give our readers more than just a hint about its contents because we do not wish to anticipate the pleasure with which julia will dilate her large blue eyes

lobsters and the host of little tilgate fairies dancingaroundtheir beloved queen not less elegant in their way are the elfin horse and the gnomeking towards the end of the tale but best of all perhaps are the vignettes of the banqueting tables and the tiny musicians in the gnome kings palace on pages 1589 and that of tinykin transformed into a mole and pricked in the rear by the sharp points of the lances and swords of the little fairy imps who figure as the gnome police as for tinykin himself like proteus the old man of the sea in the fourth georgic of virgil he omnia transformat seize in miracula rerum but how he became in turn a bird a mole a bat and a fish and how in the end as uluf the son of thomas the verderer of tilgate he fell in love with the fairy daughter of the king and lived happily ever aftenvards we must leave to be told in mr lemons owvn words the scene of the story we should observe is laid in the reign of good king horsa when the fairies may be supposed to have had it nearly all their own way in the forest and woodlands of the west saxons we will only add that a summer day in tilgate forest is a very pleasant thing indeed but we think our young friends in the schoolroom will almost prefer a few hours of the holidays in the company of tinykin and mr markl lemon whose imagi native powers have found mr charles green an admirable interpreter in the chronicles of the three sisters which follow next we have the story of a  noble baron who shows his nobility by squandering away his money and estates and living like a prince and who is profoundly

and festivities at last the princes considered that a continuance of these indulgences would enervate the courage and activity of their knights and squires the three sonsinlaw therefore with their ladies took their departure for their respective homes riccaldo the heir of the family never quitted his parents and at last like a pious son closed their eyes albert the bear bought the domain of ascania and founded the city bernberg edgar the eagle retired to switzerlandunder the shadow of the lofty alps and founded eagleton on the banks of a river which had then no name but is now called after the city by which it glides ugo the dolphin undertook an expedition into burgundy conquered part of that kingdom and named it dauphin6 and as the three princes in the names of their cities and

doll has tow additional claims on our attention firstly it teaches a high moral lesson that of checking all envious feelings an secondly its scene is laid in london partly at  kilboune near the old priory there and partly in the city how the gift of an enchanted doll is made the vehicle of conveying this lesson to a selfish and grasping londoner we will leave mr mark lemon to tell our readers in his own words for fear that his publishers should think that wve have been poaching on his and their manor and preserves we owe them our best thanks for allowving us to transfer to our pages two of the illustrations of this beautiful and really charming volume viz that of the fairies dancing in a ring round their beloved queen  from tinvkins tranformations by mr c green and that of the enchanted

andersens delightful tales in which the fantastic the poetical and the grotesque are blended with such artistic harmony but few are prepared to see the selection of eight of the prettiest stories in the splendid binding fine text and original illustrations of this truly handsome volume the twelve large chromolithographs are treated in the bright and somewhat crude colouring which has latterly been so much en vogme and seems at this season of the year especially to supersede the quieter woodcuts and engravings of former days the quaintness of this florid style is however peculiarly adapted to the subject it is most conspicuous in the picture of the wicked princess in her garden which is almost weird in its conception so much so indeed that it all but precludes the possibility of its being intended to grace a childs book not so the one of the  children playing in the water which is full of life and grace while the two interiors of the  ugly duckling and the  witch combing gerdas hair have quite a flemish finish of detail on the whole we incline to believe that the  fairy tales is more a drawingfoom album than a volume for little people whose meddlesome fingers should not be

fairies and stood on enchanted ground he has made two more journeys in the same direction and to little people of mortal mould gives the fruits of bis experience or of his invention yet not entirely of either for his first story the chronicles of the three sisters is from the german the original author of it was not much of a conjurer if there is any moral in the story which shows how three daughters of a baron came to marry a bear an eagle and a fish and that these turned out to be princes it is that sonsinlaw may not be such beasts as they look the grandest piece of magic in the story is at the service of every individual who may stand in need of it and a knowledge thereof may be profitable to many a person suffering froma baroness indulging in bitterest reproaches the baron had recourse to his invariable practice in all conjugal altercations and observed a profound silence suffer ing the lady to proceed until she was tired mr lemon does not say whether his second story the enchanted doll is original or overset from the german he does however very soon settle a point in fairy chronology for he tells us that the story    happened years ago long before the fairies had left us as we find that tony stubbs one of the characters distinguished for his ability in chasing gold and silver  had gone over the sea as far as florence to study in the workshop of the great benvenuto cellini we learn that the fairies were alive and active at least as late as the middle of the sixteenth century be this as it may the enchanted doll is a better story than  the chronicle of the three

truthfully yet spiritedly drawn the events recorded are supposed to have transpired some century or so ago in the days of powder and swords and the plot is simple and may be conveyed in a few words sir thomas warren a man of pleasure and a courtier having been employed for ten years in a diplomatic capacity abroad returns unexpectedly to england and finding himself from a variety of causes incapable of pursuing the course of life in which he has been hitherto indulging determines to occupy himself in the education of his son whom he has hitherto sadly neglected now his son jack has been residing from his infancy in thc remote corner of a midland county with his uncle squire warren a fine specimen of thc foxhunter of that period in character habits and conversation he reminds us forcibly of old sir roger de coverley aud consequently presents a striking contrast to his foppish and effeminate brother living under bis roof partaking in all his amusements and pursuits jack had become the precise counterpart of his worthy relative at thc epoch when he is introduced to us he is  rising nineteen over six feet in height hale hearty and robust a keen sportsman shy and ungainly in his manners generous and warmhearted but somewhat inclined to obstinacy and in intellect not over bright at the time when his father arrives with the intention of carrying him off to london to educate him  wiore suorum jack finds himself most unpleasantly circumstanced in consequence of an attachment bc had long since formed with the fair daughter of thc vicar lydia freeman a young belle whose bright eyes have inflamed the hearts of more than one admirer fearing an angry refusal in case he should seek his fathers consent to their union he determines to brusque matters and accordingly first obtains the young ladys consent aud then informs his parent to his astonishment sir thomas offers no opposition to the match provided thc weddingday is postponed for a couple of years as he fully anticipates that long ere then an introduction to london life with all its concomitants will have eradicated this  boyish fancy poor jack arrives in london and finds himself suddenly immersed in gaieties for which he has no taste dissipations that he abhors compelled as he is at the same time to forego all his wonted pursuits and to submit to the severest discipline while he is forced te acquire accomplishments that only render him still more awkward in his demeanour and more ludicrous in his appearance sir thomas having resolved that jack should marry a lady of fortune takes much pains to effect his introduction to an eligible individual of that denomination this excites the jealousy of a host of rivals for though jack remains undeviatingly true to his  little lydia he is compelled by bis unreasonable father to make some show of  attention  to the captivating widow fairfax now it so happens that one colonel pcnruddock has already determined to win and wear her like many others of her sex under similar circumstances out of caprice the lady pretends to admire jack greatly though she has secretly predetermined to give her hand to the colonel they meet at an evening party  tins insult colonel penruddocks malignant glance was on him hatred contempt and jealousy gleamed in his eye that very morning mistress fairfax had carelessly saidon pur pose of coursethat she never beheld so fine a man as mr warrenthat be possessed so artless yet so fascinating a mode of paying his addresses she was sure no heart could resist him then she leaned her cheek on her hand looked absent sighed and allowed the colonel to address her twice before she appeared to know that he had done so at all the colonel threw himself into one of his most violent tornadoes and rushed out of the house the widow tapped ber chin approvingly with her fan surveyed her charming face in thc glass laughed hummed an opera tune and went to the auction tiie colonel had not condescended so much as to bow to her on the evening in question when he saw jack proceeding towards her the muscles of his thin face worked nervously he placed himself in the way and as jack approached leaned his hand on

bis foot firmly planted jack tripped the colonel smiled a ghastly smile had jack been lighter or more active he would have tripped and recovered himself but the poor fellow was neither he tripped stumbled ran two or three paces forward and fell prostrate at the widows feet good manners were totally forgotten and a titter which grew to a laugh salutedjacks misfortune sir thomas swore and fumed jack arose anger and indignation chased shyness and mauvaue honte from his soul everything around bim seemed to whirl and totter he heard the laughter he felt the insult ke strode up to colonel penruddock like a young hercules and in a loud clear voice he shouted  was that on purpose or by accident  on purpose replied the colonel bowing and then drawing himself up to his utmost height  then

his face several ladies fell into  hysteric affections  and faintings but the gentlemen being all occupied round jack and the colonel they soon recovered their senses sir thomas drew his son away from penruddock anger and disgust stamped upon his features this unpleasant incident of course gives rise to a duel which is so admirably described that we cannot refrain from quoting it the duel there had been a slight fall of snow during the night which only partially covered the ground though shrill thin voice of thc sweep and though rolling of a few heavy dust carts were the predominating sounds the air was damp and penetrating the atmosphere murky and dull and beginning to bo charged with the smoke of early fires though shops were unopenedfew passengers abroadhere and there a workman proceeding

regimental surgeon who attended the colonel was equally struck with him egad sir what a grenadier hed make he said to captain richmond  i should ask nothing better than to command a battalion of the same sort was the reply jack and the colonel began their duel under very different feelings jack was determined not to hurt the colonel but merely to parry his thrusts he had no ill will towards him and no feeling for duels the colonel on the other hand felt that he was opposed to a rival and a man who had insulted him and put bim in a ridiculous position beneath the very eyes of his mistress his soul was bitter with hatred und revenge and he swore that cither jack or himself must die that day after a short  bout seeing jacks play he dropped the point of his sword and cried with flashing eyes and angry voice  i will not be treated like a child sir fight fairly and attack me as well as defend yourself jack obeyed and presently his bright sword entered penruddocks right breast fortunately for him the point slipped along one of the ribs instead of penetrating between them and anon though fight was renewed the swords wound about each other like lightningthc clear light clashing peculiar to the small sword only to be rightly explained by the word ucliquetis was the only sound heard jack received a wound in the thick of the arm but acquitted himself very well never lost bis coolness or

B3764,"['4918408', '8626462']",  the hidden path by miss harland i london knight and sons clerkenwell close it is now more than twelve months since this book was issued from the press of j c derby new york it was the second venture of the author her former publication alone having introduced her name to the public that work has reached the fourteenth edition in america and has been received with still more popularity in europe this although published under most disadvantageous circumstances with but little effort put forth for its circulation by its own merits has gained for itself and author a most prominent position the success of miss harlands former work had aroused the public expectation for the reception of  the hidden path so that we were not surprised to learn that only four weeks from the date of its publication fourteen thousand copies had been sold at a period in which the labours of the printing office have surpassed those of the factory and the hum of the press drowned the noise of the millwheel when so many volumes yearly find their way into society which seldom outlive one edition a work must possess something of more than ordinary attractiveness to meet with such a welcome the efforts of the publishers may accomplish much in bringing a work into notice and yet if it have not real merit it cannot stand before the fire of criticism which every book of our time must bear before its acceptance the very favourable notices attending the introduction of this work have commended it to our homes and hearts there are several characteristics of  the hidden path worthy of observation the author has brought us a picture of real life her story is not the highly painted romance whose greatest attraction is the wondrous scenes through which the hero of the tale is led nor has she gone out of the circle of society to find one whose peculiar lot has been a catalogue of extravagant circumstances which though boldly narrated demand an imagination equal to that of the author to follow the power of  the hidden path is the naturalness of its design so resembling our own experience of life so similar to what would be our conclusion regarding those whom she introduces to us that the mind finds it difficult to dispossess itself of the idea that this is a simple narrative a hearthistory having its counterpart elsewhere than in the fancy of the writer we know the cbaracters as we read they become our familiar friends and we look with as much interest at every circumstance and influence affecting their destiny as if they had been bound to us by the most intimate ties this is the highest style of romance if we are to have books which are to be the conveyors of practical truth and all the books we read should have this tendency we do not ask for those whose very improbability counteracts their design but books whose teachings find a response in the common sense of every mind and in the pure affections of the heart then it is that fiction steps out of its sphere becoming only the medium of illustration the instrument by which fancy weaves bright pictures upon the web of truth so nearly like the original as almost to cause us doubt whether indeed they are feigned the principle the base of all is truth  and imagination only suggests the course of action which would re sult from this we pronounce that a vitiated tastea taste corrupted by dealing with the monstrous and improbable which demands something bold even if it be the boldness of falsehood  yet we are not to be mistaken as condemning originality of thought or expres sion but we have yet to learn that a work may not be characteristic and a book of mark and yet be faithful to life in the circle of society with which we are familiar how few along the pilgrimage we are walking present anything strikingly peculiar in the aspect of their life how few have moved in an eccentric sphere out dazzling their companions and yet in the beautiful sentiment of our author each one may have some peculiar hearthistory unknown to the world he may be walking a hidden path in which he sees only gods hand pointing the way we can scarcely give an abstract of the work in the short space allowed us  and yet an epitome of the story is necessary to our review the opening act conveys us to a scene in the  old dominion where the heroine is intro duced to us as bella conway she is then a girl of eleven diffident and reserved but mature beyond her years and one in whom the traits of womanhood are already beginning distinctly to develop bellas mother after a widowhood of five years is married to mr snowden a man who beneath a polished address and christian profession carries the heart of a villain this wolf in sheeps clothing begins a series of per secutions upon bella and her younger brother jamie a crippled child hitherto the pet of the household which results in chilling the heart of the mother and driving her daughter from home separated from all that she once loved she is sent to philadelphia to school but here in the family of her uncle mr oakley she finds a home and companionship in which the years of her exile are made happy it is here we are introduced to characters who play a conspicuous part in the latter scenes of the story maurice a son of mr oakley and then a theological student and his sister isabel noble in high souled intellect and more noble in heart scarcely less a heroine than she whose path they bless these by their fraternal kindness and sympathy find entrance to bellas heart and by the magic of their love heal its broken strings after an absence of two years she returns to virginia more unwelcome than before for in her absence her property which had been committed in trust to her uncle mysteriously disappears and she is thrown upon the charities of her stepfather with an independent spirit bella resolves again to leave her home to sustain herself by teaching here she takes another step into that blind way in which duty alone is the guide she accepts a situation as instructress in the family of mr norwood a man of the stamp frequently found in refined society whose highest ideas of education extend only to the power of display the pharisee of the present i day the unobtrusive and silent manners of bella are not adapted to his ideal and therefore at the end of the first year she quits her post for the situation of subteacher in a female seminary after submitting to the privations and persecutions of a boardingschool life for a twrm she receives an invitation to the position of english teacher in a school in ric mond there for a few months the homeless wanderer seems once more at rest for in addition to the more congenial associations of her new position she enjoys the society of her betrothed williard monmiouth the playmate of her youth and now a junior partner of a mercantile house in the city even this calm is the precursor of a storm more violent than any other which has wrecked the poor girls hopes monmouth ambitious for wealth and distinction amid the excitement of gay life becomes wearied of the unpretending simplicity which concealed the noble heart of her whom he had heretofore loved and longs for one better adapted to the brilliant sphere in which he would move this he finds in the person of a miss berkeley whose fascinating address and reputed wealth win his false heart from his first love the iron trammels of love and honour which he throws off for the golden chain fall upon the heart of the deserted one and crush it to the earth for what weight can bear so heavily upon the soul as rejected affection under this weight of sorrow she pursues unmurmuringly that path which providence seems pointing out although it is hidden in mysteries and every step in the deepening shades manifests a heroism of faith at the invitation of her friends in philadelphia she removed thither again to make her home in the family of her uncle here she remains among those who appreciating her worth and sympathising in her griefs lighten the load of sorrow and restore her in some degree to the happiness of other days after a residence of two years with these she is remanded to her home in virginia by the illness of her mother then sinking into the grave forgetting the chilling neglect of the past like a ministering angel she hovers around the couch of her dying parent consoling and sustaining by her presence the last moments of the sufferer her patient sorrow at last meets its reward maurice oakley now the occupant of the mooresville parsonage whose affectionate tenderness had soothed the poignancy of her deepest grief comes to claim her as his bride and at the bedside of her dying mother she hears the vows which unite her for life to one worthy of her noble heart we suppose it may be taken for granted that every author who sends us a living book one into which he has thrown his whole soul and feelingsfor such a production is  the hidden pathhas a design beyond that of entertainment or of tracing out the joys and sorrows of the heros life this though often lost sight of by the novelreader whose criterion of literary worth is merely that of the passing effect and of the good or bad endingthis remembered becomes to us the key which opens to us new interests and treasures of beapty it gives us a familiarity with the characters of the drama and we behold each one in his turn performing some part in the design and though trivial his place and words may be yet leading on to the completion an indispensable link in the plan when this moral is discovered every separate incident has its connexion with the grand truth which is illustrated and is thus invested with new beauty as a reflector of the light that shines upon it the hidden path is an experimental illustration of the passage i will bring the blind by a way that they know not i will lead them in paths that they have not known it is impossible that a book with such a design inculcating high moral and religious principle should be other than beneficial in its effect there is no doubtful or double meaning whose tendencies may be misconstrued but a healthful tone pervading every chapter if there is a faithful portrayal of the evil in our nature it is not glossed over lby heroic deeds which cause us to regard the villain with deeper interest than his victim nor is it such as presents a morbid misanthropic view of humanity but it shows evil as it generally exists the index of a wicked heart and by its bright and beautiful contrasts makes that which is truly worthy the more love able the book has its faults but these are minor and not such as affect its moral bearing or success as a work of genius there is an oc casional extravagance of passion and of lan guage exceeding at times the natural emotion which would be excited by the circumstances such a passage we detect in one of the early chapters of the book when bella overheard the mteatete conversation between mr snowden and her mother  the truthto her a dreadful revelationburst upon the poor child her mother was to be married and to a man against whom her soul had arisen in abhorrence at first sight jealousy cruel as the grave for an instant was the pervading emotion then keen and bitter resentment against the loathed usurper as she remembered her frail crippled brother hitherto the darling most cared for by all the household cheated out of a coveted caresson this the very night of her returnby the glozing foidlings of a lover was this an earnest of what the future held for him  shaking with horror and passion she made her way back to jamies room it seems to us that this height of passion ascribed to a child of eleven years whose dislike had arisen only from a prejudice created an hour before is unnatural it is probable that she would learn these intimations with sorrow and experience an increasing dislike for the intruder but we think the expression  shaking with horror and passion somewhat extravagant and forced lve notice this tendency in other passages of the work yet we can see throughout this a decided improvement upon the former writings of miss harland this with a proneness to magrniloquence or rather the use of a composite word where a simpler expression would convey the meaning are the only defects which we would suggest as worthy of correction in the style but we would like to speak at large upon the power and beauty of that style combining excellences seldom equalled in no case excelled among the writers of the present day the tendency to foreign terms noticeable in  alone is not found here but a purity of language and felicity of illustration more to be admired because manifesting an advance in this respect if the book does not possess the same chain of brilliant incidents as miss harlands former production it has for the discerning mind more of the truly beautiful and as a volume far surpasses that in all that makes a work excellent its humour is inimitable its pathos simple and touching its conversation easy and natural its descriptions and panegyrics thrilling there are many passages worthy of praise which none can read without emotion and others which cause a thrill to pass through the whole frame such is the reverie of isabel as she sits through the long night by the cold hearthstone pouring out the wail of a forsaken heart chapter twentyfourth the description of the railroad collision in the thirtieth chapter brings the whole scene vividly before our eyes with isabel we see the darting of the fire breathing monsters hear the clash of death and the moans of the suffering and dying these are but a few illustrations from the hidden path  but it abounds with them every sen timent of isabel and frank and maurice de serves mention but we have already trespassed beyond our bounds the hidden path is worthy of a place in every home circle and its pure sentiments a dwellingplace in every heart as a virginia production it does credit to the state in which so many of its scenes are laid and from whose homes so many of its characters are drawn  the hidden path by marion harland low  uothis is an improvement upon the authors last story of alone reviewed by us on its appearance there is more pith and consistency in the plot and very much less fine writingfewer provincialisms both of thought and

very ambitiousas every novel must be ambitious which pretends to embrace the whole life of a man from the cradle to the grave the fault of the voice of the people is that it is too long we do not mean that its length is excessive in any absolute sense nor that the author digresses unduly from the theme which she has set herself nor do we mean that the book is dull it never is dull we mean that much of it is unimportant and inessential in the pretty and diverting scenes of white and black life at sleepy kingsborough the home of nick burr that born lawyer and politician and state governor this triviality of observation is especially felt it has a weakening effect on the story as a whole the original projective force of an author is strictly limited by nature and if the author tries to spread that force over too large an area the result must be in a measure to render it futile miss glasgows faculty of observation needs discipline it is too busy too fussy and a great deal too

distinguished and the dialogue though too plentiful is lifelike and effective the sketches of negro character are excellent miss glasgow has a wide knowledge of life and manners the novel seems to be

boy who from nothing reaches a position of importance in his native state the hopes despairs successes and failures and other vicissitudes that meet him on his path are described with some vividness but there is more than this to attract the reader and more especially those with a liking for tales of the southern american states these latter are a happy hunting ground for clever novelists across the atlantic since  the open question and a book by mrs burnett we do not remember any story with so fine a southern setting and background for character as this where it is not plot and incident it is a series of bright soft pictures of nature itself of luxuriant gardens and of people instinct with droll or lovable peculiarities the life of the old virginian landowners the negro servants their

also admirable so is the household of judge bassett and so in another way are the hardworking family of the ambitious poorwhite  hero the farmstead and the harsh yet kind stepmother and her chronic neuralgy all these persons places and things are excellent because beneath the impressionist touch of miss glasgow there is a solid hold on average human nature we perceive this in many matters in the relations between the general and his daughter and in a sense of an underlying unforced pathos in passing people and inanimate objects around them the group of happy irresponsible children is charmingly drawn then there are the sayings and doings of the black people often comical to a high degree indeed uncle ish his dignified almost injured attitude towards the kind human ravens who

nature and while here she dwells by preference among the more amiable specimens of it she does not shirk sterner realities indeed the story of her central character is so full of pain that we somewhat

canvas outside a show at a fair it gives a foretaste of the entertainment within and the clown cuts a joke with the visitor who has paid his money and passes inward just inside the threshold mr bailey himself has a word to say with each of his generous public his theme treats of the motives which induce the world of authors to write and he airs his wit by remarking it is not for me to judge the

purer and better and his life made to appear brighter and his soul lifted up generally i shall sincerely rejoice to hear it this is a sort of keynote to the volume and from it some idea may be gathered of the samples of american humour to be found in the volume itself some of the samples are odd and others are extravagant we class among the former the boy who nearly lost the entire use of one eye by constantly revolving it around in search of an unfriendly faction of boys  also the dissipated lad who witnessed all the funeral ceremonies he could on a sunday because being surrounded with puritanical influences at home the sabbath was dreary to him  the horses are as odd as the lads one of the former  would get up from a meal at delmonicos to kick the president of the united states  and another was such a bolter that in a tight pinch he would run away from a position in the new york custom house no little portion of what is supposed to be humour in this volume consists in the extravagance of some of its descriptions it is said for instance of a quakeress her gesture is not graceful it is just such a motion as a person would undoubtedly acquire who had executed a contract to push fifteen hundred boys down two flights of stairs now and then there is a touch of description something better as in the following of walt whitman   walt whitman is writing more of his poetry the last is an ode to america he intelligently observes what if that gift ot gift thou lackst the perfect feminine of thee the beauty health completion flt for thee the mothers flt for thee and here he stops not a word of how the battle resulted but just drops down and leaves the reader to imagine the result this is the secret of his success his stops make him popular the more he stops the more popular he becomes if he should stop altogether the public would give him a monument and perhaps a horse after about a hundred and fifty pages of oddity and extravagance which become exceedingly dull and wearisome we arrive at the close of the first part there is much justification for sayingfor this relief much thanks and we entirely agree with one of mr baileys enunciations of wisdom   all things have an end and this dreary performance was not an exception the second part is in the form of  letters these are improvements on the supposed wit and humour of the first portion here is something reasonable in one of these epistles  there is a commodore in say brook who used to be a very distinguished person in the merchant service many years ago he was master of the duke of northumberland one of the handsomest and staunchest vessels in the line he was a captain in those days when to be a captain of a vessel was better than to be a god in a heathen town of eight thousand inhabitants but now his sailing days are over and he has sunk to the level of a commodore he has a nice place and a lot of barns on one of these a onestory affair ia perched the figurehead of the duke of northumberland being a colossal figure in wood of a dead white colour and not the least approach to levity in any of its lineaments there is a peculiar sensation in watching this incongruous spectaclea little yellow barn and a towering piece of sculp tare on its summit there stands the duke with his pants in his boots as was the greeleyism of a century ago looking off toward the ocean and thinking how different things are now from what they were when he was a boy this is a very painful thought but very instructive it is years since the dake left the oceanlong weary rearsbut if he could speak if the inanimate wood could only speak what wondrous stories it would tell of the wharfairs it has passed through there is a good deal of strength in this thought the last division of the book is under the heading of  local items they consist of maxims axioms and of illustrations of danbury life in love business and politics for example this among many others a prominent badge of american citizenship appears to be a soiled shirt with gold studs politics present themselves in these items somewhat eccentrically thus we hear of an anxious boardinghouse keeper who inquires  if when a woman has the right to vote she can be made to pay as much board as a man  these matters are copiously illustrated so copiously indeed that the reader is fain to cry  hold enough  but the author has his own

B5994,"['3169788', '6799254']",  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust that it has gone far enough to attract readers to a book which i am myself loth to lay down george cotterell,ovel_contra

alone and get back to more romantic material  rodent corner by henry seton merri man smith elder  co henry seton merrimans new story turns upon the development and extension of an industry which levies a terrible toll on human life malgamite  an essential in the manufacture of paper the company is promoted under the clever disguise of a philanthropic scheme by one of those archvillains who flourish so abundantly in fiction but are fortunately seldom met with in real life von holzens villainies are discovered and he himself is finally brought to bay by one tony cornish a sophisticated gentleman of fashion whose good blood has the remarkably original faculty of not failing him on emergency this quality appears to be one of the authors discoveries at any rate it contributes to the stock of epigrams of varying degrees of triteness which in this book even more than in some of the writers previous works go far towards obstructing the course of an otherwise excellent story for the plot is as dexterously contrived and manipulated as in any former romance by the same hand and if the characters continue to smack of limelight and stagelight generally they can play their parts adequately enough for the purpose the malgamite works are set up in a dreary corner of the dutch coast by von holzen and his ally a more incomplete villain who gives his name to the book the spot is chosen as being sufficiently remote from the fashionable philanthropists and others who have joined the company in london on the understanding that the process of malgamite manufacture is henceforth to be transformed from a poisonous into a safe and wholesome industry the truth lies however rather in the contrary direction and tony cornish whose eyes have been opened to it conveys the hapless collection of workpeople to the spot with the determination of exposing the villainous but profitable scheme of von holzen and percy roden the descrip  tion of the doomed and already haltpoisoned

they passed him some of them took the trouble to answer his salutation others seemed indifferent few seemed to take an interest in their surroundings they exchanged no comments but walked side by side in silencedumb and driven animals some of them bore signs of disease a few stumbled as they went one or two were halfblind with groping handsone shadow lay over them allthe shadow of death today when public attention is being turned to the unwholesome industries this description is likely to attract attention the remainder of the story is played out in holland cornishs determination to defeat and expose von holzen results in more than one fight for his life these stirring scenes of action afford the author the opportunity for the display of his best powers which lie in the direction of rapid action tangible episodes and the description of that which is perceptible to the outward rather than to the inward eye roden has a sister of very different calibre from himself whose presence at scheveningen cheers cornish on his way while it complicates his retributive action there are other persons of the feminine gender who play more or less prominent niles in the story but these only serve to emphasise the fact that the intricacies of human character and of womans character in particular are somewhat outside this writers scope dogmatize as he will on the subject the story ends in the triumph of the right cause and of the happy lover it will certainly satisfy the admirers of the authors former books while it does nothing to change the impression of those who found him before to be an excellent craftsman as regards plots but decidedly wanting in many of those subtle qualities and refinements which go to the making of a great writer or a literary artist,ovel_contra
B3274,"['6845750', '3175093', '2441038']",  a tramps sketches the soul of a tramp by stephen graham macmil lan and co 5s net this book is a record of a walk along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and of a pilgrimage to jerusalem it differs markedly from most books of travel however in that the author is less concerned with the things seen along the line of route than with his own spiritual emotions and experiences as he himself says it is not so much a book about russia as about the tramp mr graham is among those who find salvation by going out into the wilderness he reminds one at times of thoreau there is the same impatience with the meaningless restraints of civilisation the same wild exuberant delight in the freedom of nature but whereas thoreaus withdrawal from the world had bred in him a certain scorn of humanity mr graham is overflowing with the milk of human kindness he finds friends everywhereamong the peasants of the russian steppes in eastern monasteries or turkish bazaars thoreau was alike by conviction and temperament a pagan the tone and temper of mr grahams book on the other hand are those of the christian so one is not surprised at the note of blitheness that runs through these pages often footsore the wanderer is never weary the world is full of unexpected delights there is the joy of the road the feeling of exhilaration that comes upon a man as he shoulders his knapsack and sets forth bravely into the unknown and there are quiet restingplaces at the journeys end sunrise and sunset the sound of the sea the music of birds darkness and the coming of dawnthese things become invested with a new meaning to the man who has gone out into the wilderness to find his soul he has time too to thinkand to pray and prayer mr graham would have us believe has an added effectiveness when offered amidst the silences of nature    prayers he writes are strong out of doors made in the presence of all the stars one is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there is calm all around and in ones own heart the mysterous beauty of the starry sky reflects itself in the soul and across its mirror sails the pale moon my own body becomes a cradle in which the little christ child sleeps there are angels everywhere i am in universal keeping for the stars are all looking and pointing to me because of the little child the shepherds near by

rarer atmosphere it is to have been made free for a few hours at least of the company of saints and heroes this much we owe to mr graham who has added to english literature a book that if we mistake not is destined to endure  a tramps sketches by stephen graham 5s net m5acmillan the reader may consider mr grahams book in two lights either as a volume of remarkably interesting reminiscences of life on the open road or as a powerful appeal to the modern world to forsake the worship of the golden calf the authors tramp was along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and eventually to the heavenly city in the company of russian pilgrims his pen paints delicate little portraits of the simple and loveable russian peasant it describes too with striking vividness nights spent in strange cities and in lonely shacks i slept with the bare world as my house the sky as my roof and god as host he writes and lest an incautious reader should exclaim  how lovely we hasten to add that like the apostle paul mr graham was often in perils of waters in perils in the city and constantly in weariness and painfulness but the author expressly states that his book is more concerned with the tramp than with russia  it is the life of the wanderer and seeker the walking hermit the rebel against modern conditions and commercialism who has gone out into the wilderness commercialism he says is at present the great enemy of the individual man and the only hope for salvation is first of all for a few to live their lives out to the full in order that all others may live their lives completely mr graham seems conscious as he writes that he is a prophet crying in the wilderness and even if some of his readers may consider that he is imagining a vain thing they will be constrained to admit that the pursuit of this ideal has one great merit so far as mr graham is concernedthe delightful record of his vagabondage  a tramps sketches by stephen graham macmillan and co this is another volume by the author of undiscovered russia a charming tour of a tramp a real tramps life along the caucasian and crimean shores mr stephen graham admits frankly that he is a wanderer by predilection a rebel against modern conditions of commercialism which threaten not only to destroy art but the very perception for artistic creation it is a delightful book redolent of the open air of the night of the great silences of expanse and yet full of incident of aperfus into russian conditions and the minds of peasants revealing a real spiritual and material sympathy both with the black earth and the monks of monasteries whose hospitality he enjoyed and with his fellowcomrades of the road it is life that interests the author here we can get it and it is like splashing about in a clear pool on a warm summers day spontaneous in inspiration mature in philosophic contemplation this sort of book gives a man honest pleasure more it sets his heart beating in unison with the author in harmony with the

the coppice the wood the countryhouse and the cottage his book of the seasons  and  year book of the country proved him to be a clear observer of nature and combining with the eyes of the naturalist the fancy of the poet he has preserved a series of pictures of rural england which will be remembered and enjoyed when many works of more pretension and perhaps of more power have i passed away and are forgotten a novel the principal scenes of wvhich are laid in the country can scarcely fail to be interesting so many are the opportunities it must i offer for the exercise of his peculiar abilities and accordingly we find in mfadamn dorrington of the dene a succession of charming pictures both of places and persons strung together by a story ingeniously constructed not so much to take the reader by surprise and startle him into attention by incidents that tread upon the very verge of the impossible as is the fashion with most of the modern french novelists and a numerous school at home but which gradually engages the regard of the readers as the characters are revealed in the course of the narrative and as the events unfold themselves by degrees this is precisely as the manner is in real life where we first form an acquaintance of the eye then with the mind then come to feel an attachment for the person and then an interest in his fortunes kvilliam howitt possesses the faculty so all important to the novelist of recommending his characters to our regards by the very thoroughness of the revelations of their weaknesses as well as of their virtues  he knows that only human beings can interest us that human beings have their faults and that a perfect hero or heroine or model man or woman would excite no sympathy in any breast however youthful and romantic therefore he presents to us people as they are the man and woman of common place everyday life so that in their feelings and motives and thoughts we read our own this is the purpose of a fiction all the scenes at the dorringtons and in the village of which they avere the patrons are delightfully told  the english squire and his lady their mansion their grounds the surrounding woods and hills the hamlet and its inhabitants the good vicar and his family the farmer and his workpeople are portrayed to the life individually and grouped and so does this portion of the work recommend itself by its truthfulness that it is always with regret that the reader is taken away from it to places less graphically drawn and personages less real and great is his joy when he is born back again by the telegraphic power which is vested in the writer of a fiction although much tempted we shall not depart in this instance from the wholesome rule we have adopted and anticipate the pleasure of the reader in its perusal by giving him a hint of the plot such a plan of reviewing a novel is indeed equally unjust anl unkind to author and reader one of the chiefest pleasures of a novel is the devnelopment of the plot as we read we are unwilling to lay it down until we have discovered the disentanglement of the doubts and difficulties which are the substance of the story and which it is the business of the novelist ingeniously to create for the very purpose of provoking his ingenuity to overcome them when one has read a review that has given a meagre outline of the plot that zest is gone if then it be read it is only languidly with a foregone conclusion there is no eagerness to adv ance to the end it is laid down at ev ery moment withoutregret and taken up again with careless indifference if at all the province of a literary journal is to introduce new books to its readers as a matter of news and information and as its notice usually precedes the perusal of a novel by the public it is dealing most unfairly and illiberally with the author and the 1ublisher and inconsideratelv towards its reader if it breaks the chain of novelty by a narrative of the plot afterwards indeed when it has been read criticism in the favour of a quarterly or monthly review may properly take it in hand and deal with its plot as it may deserve but it is in our oji on to nistake the design and purpose ofa literarl journal to use it thus and therefore we have alw ays refrained fromu an revelations that mnight he likely to disturb the readers pleasure contenting ourselves with general remarks upon the most

fulfil his wishes mr howitt has been tempted into a liberal use of the novelists marvels strange to say while no one believes in these it would appear as if every one wished to see them exhibited otherwise those who please to live must have long ago discovered some less hackneyed and more probable mode of winding up their taleswe ought to have said that round about madam dorrington dene

B334,['6660140'],  the folklore of rome collecte by waord of i mouth fro the people by r h busi author of  patralias   sagas from the far east c london longmans  co 1874 miss blsk deserves great credit for the perseverance with which she has collected her extensive store of roman folktales and for the pains she has taken in grouping and marshalling them in almost every respect her present book is far superior to the other volumes of a similar nature which she has compiled and we may fairly look forward to receiving from her if she unflaggingly continues her studies such work as may be praised without reservation at present although her method bas decidedly improved there is still room in it for further improvement for instance a collector who takes down tales from the mouths of the common people ought if professing to work in the cause of science to give the names and address of every storyteller otherwise the world has no guarantee fbr the authenticity of the transcript this duty miss busk has entirely ignored and consequently we have no means of testing the accuracy of her impressions this is the more to be lamented inasmuch as these roman folktales are often told in language unlike that in which their sister stories are narrated elsewhere we may take as an example the passage in filagranata p 9 which depicts one of those wellknown scenes in which a prince having kissed a relative in spite of his wifes warning not to do so forgets that wife and prepares to take to himself another we have seen the kissing incident described a hundred times but never in such a style as this then all in the palace went to their sleepingchambers but the prince as it had been his wont from his childhood upwards went into his mothers room to kiss her after she wats asleep and when he saw her placid brow on the pillow with the soft white hair parted on either side of it and the eyes which were wont to gaze or him with so much love resting in sleep he could not forbear from pressinf his lips on her forehead and giving the wonted kiss as miss busk holds forth a promise of a second series let us hope that she will follow the good example set by mr campbell in his tales of the west highlands in which the name and address of the narrator of each story are conscientiously recorded as well as the date and place of its narration in that second series we would suggest also that as a general rule not more than one version of the same story shculd be given at length the repetition of all but identical incidents soon becomes wearisome on the other hand variants such as those which miss busk has given in small print are always valuable to comparers though they are apt to prove tedious to ordinary readers miss busk does not appear to be well acquainted with what has already been done in italy or is nfow being done to illustrate the folklore of its various provinces it seems that she  had heard it so often positively asserted that modern italy had no popular mythology and no contribution of special versions to offer to the worlds store of traditionary tales that she long refrained from attempting to discover any current italian folktales at last she took to hunting through the bookshops new and old to find any sort of collection of traditionary tales ready made but only with the effect of establishing the fact that no italian grimm had yet arisen to collect and organise them and put them into available shape it is true that she has heard of professor de gubernatis but she did not see his book on zooloyical iytlhology academt vol iv p 221 till after her ms was in the printers hands moreover she tells us the comparatively recent collection of sicilian tales by laura gonzenbach it was published in 1870 we may as well observe mentioned by irot ssor de 4ubernatis i did not know of and have not been able to see now to send information from london to a student of italian folklore residing in the capital of italy might seem to be equivalent to sending owls to athens or coals to newcastle it may be of use however to other explorers of the field to which miss busk has devoted herself if we give a few references to some of the books which have already appeared or are now in preparation upon the subject of the italian folktale as it happens two of the best edited collections of popular tales which we possess come from italythe volksmndirchen

all parts of italy indeed at the present moment the tales current among the peasantry are being diligently collected and sedulously compared before long the italian folktale will be better represented than almost any other member of the widelyspread family to which it belongs it is of course unnecessary to say that there is very little that is absolutely novel in the rounan folktales the fiarole which occupy the first third of miss busks colleoc tion are variants of the old familiar  fairytales  to which we have so often listenedtales which if we are not mistaken have passed from the pens of professional eastern storytellers to the lips of the roman peasantry some of the details are curious thus in  the dark king a variant of the cupid and psyche story or that of  beauty and the beast combined with  blue beard the girl who opens the door of the forbidden chamber finds within it  a num ber of beautiful maidens weaving glittering raiment and  a goldsmith and all his men  making ornaments all of whom state that they are preparing the wedding apparel of the dark kings bride but beyond them is 4a little old hunchback sitting crosslegged and patching an old torn coat with a heap of other wornout clothes lying about him and he says he is mending the rags for the girl to go away in who was to have been the bride of the dark king and soon afterwards she has to retire in rags and disgrace after having driven a knife into the breast of her sleeping and unsuspecting lord in a variant of the story the deccan punchkin the russian koshchei the norse  giant who had no heart in his body the external object with which the demoniacal personages life is mysteriously connected is a stonewhich is lodged inside the head of a bird which lives inside the head of a leveret which resides inside the central head of a sevenheaded hydra when this stone is placed under the pillow of the demoniacal being who is represented as a wizard or magician he gives three terrible yells turning himself round and round three times and falls dead the incident has been interpolated in a version evidently derived from a literary source of the story of  aladdins lamp in a roman version apparently borrowed from modern greece of the strange myth of the king who insists upon marrying his daughter because her foot is exactly fitted by her dead mothers shoe the princess escapes from her father inside  a figure of an old woman just like life fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it just like a real woman in  the two hunchbacked brothers  we have an unsatisfactory version of a fairy story well known in coltic lands a hunchback is surrounded on a wide moor by a whole host of little hunchbacks who dance around him chanting plaintivelysaldbbto domouica many times at last he chimes in with the word  lunedi   whereupon both he and i they lose their humps his equally hunchbacked brother having tried the same ecepriment and having added the line  martei   to the song of  a tribe of hunchbacks which ransabbato domoenica lunedi   receives from them a drubbing and an added hump the story is unintelligible and unreasonable in its roman dress in the form in which it appears in the siddui kmir it is perfectly intelligible and certain premises being granted completely reasonable more   over the celtic tale is fraught with but a small amount of moral teaching while the italian tale can boast of none at all but their mongolian elder sister is absolutely replete with edifying doctrine after the favole in miss busks collection follow a

on its lower plane a selfrespecting craftsman it is possible to disagree profoundly at times with the work he turns out even as it is possible to complain not only of his conception of his art but of the manner of its achievement but it is quite impossible to neglect or disparage him that is to say if his work does not come to us carrying the reason of its being its mien and manner at least declare it to have had some urgent cause of being in the mind of its author that is muchin truth it is all and in a day largely given up to the mere making of books it is the mark of an author that demands reading where so much may be safely neglected therefore this present book of his will we fear not much enhance his reputation it bears all the signs of having been scotched in the making to serve the purpoc e of the series for which it was intended not that mr masefield can deny himself or the spirit that impels him his mood will out but it displays itself in one or two ill i ways either the worthier element of the book is hushed to a subservient portion a far echo of itself or it usurps the action all the tales of the earth are built on the same lines it is the manner of their handling that marks the difference between worthiness and unworthiness in the present instance mr alasefield has sketched his tale to fit the scope of his volume and we often feel that it is demanding of him a larger treatment he himself feels it and therefore now and then indulges himself with things that do not belong to his story it is frankly a tale of adventure charles harding is at school near deptford towards the latter end of the seventeenth century being sent one day by dr carter who keeps this academy for the sons of gentlemen into deptford to procure his weekly portion of snuff harding with teodoro mora the foreign master at the academy is waylaid and captured for export as a slave he is sold to a tobaccofarmer in virginia where teodoro mora or little theo  as he was anciently nicknamed at the deptford academy is transported further south it is to  little theo  that the main adventure comes for his master soon dies and escaping thence strange wanderings befall himstrange not only in themselves but in the province in which he finds taut craft and obedient crews till he can readily be forgiven the thought that a fatherly destiny had him in charge for the accomplishment of great ends let us not spoil mr masefields story by telling it over in detail suffice it to say that mora became initiated into the ancient mysteries and ritual of the indians of the south he is hailed by them as the saviour of old prophecy who is to bind them into a nation and cast out the white men who have invaded their lands 2o high a mission with all that it means of power and glory naturally inflames his imagination for he knows it possible of realisation to this end he is tutored and disciplined by their priests and for a final consummation is taken by them to their holy island where a special caste of priests resides in attendance on their central temple their hierapolis of worship none other may land but he for the very earth is sacred they leave him at the shore having arrived he has difficulty in finding the temple for the vegetation is rank and the forest inextricable when at last he finds it however death and desolation greet him on all hands a plague has swept over the island and all the priests are dead moreover he is many miles from the shore and thus he seems likely to learn the lot of a castaway indeed this might very likely have been so but for the visit of a crew of pirates that discover him feverstricken on the shore he is taken by them and being competent to navigate is made sailing master and led on a smuggling expedition to far virginia his plans and papers lie guards zealously from his quondam comrades and lie will not let them extract from him what took him to the island meanwhile charles harding has been serving his time as a slave being sent on one occasion on a distant errand for his master what strange thing should befall him but that he should be captured by a band of smugglers and that this band of smugglers should have as its chief no less a person than little theo no sooner does this happen than two iiomentous events occur first little theo learns that his captain has ransacked his papers aid has fled to discover what of worth the island held for him second their band is attacked by indians thereafter it becomes a chase for the island the tale is well told and yet the excellence of the form has its drawbacks charles harding is in conduct of the first portion telling all within his knowledge till his meeting with little theo and the 4oght with the indians little theo takes up the relation saying what makes the captains theft of his plans so important and what urgent cause drives him to pursuit then charles harding continues the tale telling of the pursuit to the conclusion thus the sequence of narration is deftly secured but the conclusion after so urgent a flagellation of the fancy after so many difficulties encountered and furiously over come it is a little disconcerting to discover the temple on the island blown up by the errant captain and his comrades dire iconoclasts  and to see our heroes turn to the very mundane business of ironore merchants yet so it is the endeavour is indeed lost but more is lost than the endeavour a good book has been lost it has turned to barrenness in mr masefields hands for it is not a short story tritely and fitly told it is a tale of portentous scope crippled in the making but there are passages that bear witness to the hand that achieved them such is charles hardings account of the fight with the red indians a veritable masterpiece of strange and potent excitement such too is  little theos  beautiful account of the island and his discoveries there but such passages are only proof that the hand that penned the book is

heroes and heroines are cleverly delineated but even these traits acquire undue prominence from the incompleteness of the portraitures neither the story nor the characters of lord kilgobbin however constitute its chief point of interest this is above all an irish political novel and it is to the sketch of contemporary irish policy it contains that we would specially direct attention the difficulties surrounding a task of this kind are many and obvious and mr lever has in our opinion displayed not only great tact and skill but also rare good taste in his mode of dealing with them there is a commendable absence of party feeling in the book and no attack is made on individual politicians the authors and instruments of the policy depicted are typical rather than actual characters it would not be easy to find the exact or even approximate prototypes of lord danesbury the lord lieutenant of his private secretary mr walpole of mr atlee the universally accomplished and thoroughly unscrupulous young journalist who contributes articles to all the principal magazines and journals in europe on all sides or of mr daniel donogan the fenian head centre who is a figure of heroic and ideal mould and yet these personages are invested with a high degree of verisimilitude and undeniably bear a certain amount of resemblance to men who have influenced the fortunes of ireland in our own time mr lever has approached his subject in the spirit of an artist and not of a politician he lays before us a concrete picture of the irish problem and of the means that have recently been employed to solve it but he does not in this book propose any solution of his own although 4 lord kilgobbin  has a purpose it cannot be said to have a party purpose it is instructive without being didactic while admirably calculated to increase the readers knowledge of ireland and the irish question it does not seek directly to influence his political opinions the author is evidently no admirer of the whig policy he portrays but in the present work he strives with no mean degree of success to maintain an impartial attitude in all probability no friend of though whigs could have given us so truthful a delineation of their method of governing ireland as mr lever has set before us mr cecil walpole private secretary to his relative the lordlieutenant is the chief exponent and embodiment of whig principles in the work and he is in his way an original and effective creation this elegant young gentleman is described as  an aristocrat by birth and predilection who made a parade of democratic opinions a pale finelyfeatured almost effeminate young man the most recent product of the age we live in who  affected a sort of crichtonism in the variety of his gifts and as linguist musician artist poet and philosopher loved to display the scores of things he might be instead of the mild very ordinary young gentleman he was when we are introduced to mr walpole he is on a ramble to the westmeath lakes in company with mr lockwood of the carbineers an extra aidedecamp to the viceroy  not very positive whether their object was to angle for trout or to fish for that  knowledge of ireland so popularly sought after in our day walpole is certainly a promising whig and there is truth as well as humour in mr levers description of a promising young whig as 44 one who coquettes with radical notions but fastidiously avoids contact with the mob and who fervently believing that all popular concessions are spurious if not stamped with whig approval would like to treat the democratic leaders as forgers and knaves owing to the distaste of lord danesbury for the post assigned to him by the government the viceroy absents himself from ireland and leaves the government of that country to a large extent in the hands of mr walpole who has been in the habit rf assuring his distinguished relative that there is a mt game to be played in ireland and he throws himsdf into the game heartily and confidently for he hiteadt to play in accordance with a  plan  that is he thimb bound to win his little scheme is disclosed in a  stricuv confidential conversation with lord kilgobbins simwha has been persuaded by the fenian donogan to offer himself as a candidate for his native county in the  nationalist interest and who has called on the private secretary to ask the support of the government instead of complying with or refusing the request of the aspirant the  craft mr walpole seeks to astonish his visitor by an exposition of the masterly tactics by which he proposes to deal with irish disaffection  well now here it is the irish vote as the yankees would cali it is of undoubted value to us hut it is confoundedly dear with paul cullen on one side and fenianism on the other we have no peace time was when you all pulled one way and a sop to the pope pleased you all now that will suffice no longer the  sovereign pontiff dodge  is the surest of all ways to offend the nationals so that in reality what we want in the house is a number of liberal irishmen who will trust the government to do as much for the catholic church as english bigotry will permit and as much for the irish peasant as will not endanger the rights of property over the channel  there is a wide field there certainly said dick smiling is there not cried the other exultingly not only does it bowl out the established church and protestant ascendancy but it inverts the position of landlord and tenaat to unsettle everything in ireland so that anybody might hope to be anything or to own heaven knows whatto legalise gambling for existence to a people who delight in high play and yet not involve us in a civil warwas a grand policy kearney a very grand policy not that i expect a young ardent spirit like yourself fresh from college ambitions and highflown hopes will take this view dick only smiled and shook his head just so resumed walpole  i could not expect you to like this programme and i know already all that you allege against it but as b says kearney the man who rules ireland must know how to take command of a ship in a state of mutiny and yet never suppress the revolt the brutal old tories used to master the crew and hang the ringleaders and for that matter they might have hanged the whole ships company we know better kearney and we have so confused and addled them by oar policy that if a fellow were to strike his captain he would never be quite sure whether he was to be strung up at the gangway or made a petty officer do you see it now  unfortunately the working out of the details of this policy required more caution and discretion than mr walpole could command and the discovery of a memorandum advising a chief constable to assist and bribe donogan to leave ireland induced lord danesbury to resign the lordlieutenancy and reduced his accomplished secretary to the necessity of accepting an appointment worth about 20001 ayear in guatemala in his love affairs this  promising young whig is as fickle and as unsuccessful as in his public career and the manner in which mr lever sustains the consistency of this character in all his various relations and proceedings is a veritable triumph of artistic fiction there is a great deal of almost equally interesting matter in this novel that deserves mention but we must content ourselves with stating that  lord kilgobbin is in our opinion the best work of fiction that its author has written  lord kilgobbin by c1iait is leave 3 vopa smith elder  co the publication in a complete form of mr levers last novel which a melancholy and pathetic dedication points to as his last in another and less welcome sense is the principal fact of the month in the department of fiction it is not common in a good novelist though only too usual in a bad one to find his last book exactly as readable as his first yet lord kilgobbin is at least as amusing and brilliant if not so dashing as those wellknown stories which made mr levers name a household word,ovel_contra

B8611,"['3161093', '8937533', '6654479']",  sir george tressady by mrs humphry ward 6s smith and elder some of us critics of mrs humphry ward have the air of being impossible to please we scouted  robert elsmere  and marcella  for being sugarcoated pamphlets and when she struck out on a quite new path in bessie cotterell in which there was no pamphlet we said that she was attempting work that did not become her now she returns to the earlier model her new story being in fact a sequel to is marcella well at least we cannot ask her to go back to the bessie cotterell  type for that in her hands failed for want of artistic sincerity and her reversion to the kind of thing that first brought her fame means that she has tendencies likings aptitudes that she cannot be criticised out of we ought to be more reasonable now and we are but perhaps the merits of sir george tressady  have something to do with it it is the story of a rather likeable rather colourless man of brains and nar row sympathies who spoilt his political career because marcella exerted such an influence over him that he voted against his party and even his convictions marcella was a goddess to him and he had married a little thin natured shallow vixen of a wife he behaves with great propriety so does marcella so does marcellas husband they all do except lady tressady but propriety does not keep off tragedy and what with his amusingly reckless and frivolous old mother his embittered wife his poverty the strikes among his workmen his shattered parliamentary career and his hopeless adoration of marcella when a hard and heroic death comes to him it is welcome the parliamentary incidents do not strike us as probable marcella in her mellower years is more distasteful than ever wvith her fawning amiability her air of making eyes at all the world including her husband her child and the eastend seamstresses she is a most unpleasing personalitywith something of the chadband in her for all her indiscretions but the book though a dull book is the work of a woman of intellect and of unusually strong sympathies the portraits here are subtler and more living than in her earlier works especially the disagreeable ones like the two lady tressadys and the scenes in the eastend are stamped with sincerity if there was but a little spark of fire anywhere  here is not the temper nor the material out of which great novels can come but in fiction at least we have no abler presentment of the selfconscious earnestness of the time  sir george tressady mrs wards new novel by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co there can be no question that mrs ward is a puzzle to the conscientious critic this has partly resulted from the history of her career as a novelist if we leave miss bretherton out of the reckoning we may say that she seemed to bo sprung upon the reading world with an exaggerated form of that sort of success which somebody has called a sue ces gladstonea rather dangerous preeminence in which if she has a rival it is as his advertisements remind us mr hall caine schoolgirls at once spoke of her with awe and many persons of influence people interested in religious and philanthropic developments whose literary judgement was not necessarily above the level of the schoolgirls on the other hand a section of the illuminati chiefly because she dealt with these religious and social matters legitimate subjects if any were for dramatic treatmentat once set her down for a prig and a pedant and would have no more to do with her all this tends to the confusion of the moderate and modest critic has he to do with a sort of cleansed and refined zola he asks himself or only a more philosophical edna lyall it must make the application of the heavendescended maxim not easy to the distinguished author herself in the present case the critic might well get rid of his difficulties by indiscriminate praise of mrs wards  sir george tressady were such a course fair to any one concerned there is so much that is good throughout and the latter part especially is so fine and moving that faultfinding is disarmed most of the qualities which distinguished  marcella  far above the run of its contemporaries are present again here we have nothing so fully understood and so finely handled as the village life in the previous volumenothing so poetical as the description of hurds poaching or so affecting as the night of hurds execution spent by marcella in the cottage with his wife but the glimpses we get here of the labouring classes their ways and thoughts whether in eastend london or in the mining village in the midlands we should have supposed either north staffordshire or derbyshire from the peoples talk had not mrs ward while giving the characteristic e for a piece  or pleace for placeomitted altogether the equally characteristic ii for e a  for he are well realized and now and then are startlingly effective the english is always choice and in one passage at least the description of sir george tressady awaking in his library after a great quarrel with his wife it reaches a high level the morning air blew upon him and he drew it in with delight how blessed was the sun and the silence of the streets and the dappled sky there to the east beyond the square  after those long hours of mental tension in the crowd and heat of the house of commons what joy what physical relief he caught eagerly at the sensation of bodily pleasure driving away his cares letting the morning freshness recall to him a hundred memoriesthe memories of a traveller who has seen much and loved nature more than man blue surfaces of rippling sea cool steeps among the mountains streams brawling over their stones a thousand combinations of grass and trees and sunand like heralds before the presence these various images flitted passed drew to one side while memory in trembling revealed at last the best she hadan english river flowing through june meadows under a heaven of flame a woman with a child the scents of grass and hawthorn the plashing of water the story of the novel is that of a young man returned after some years of travel and study in our indian and colonial empire full of the revived imperialist if everybody had his due they might fairly be described as the kiplingesque ideas which are such a marked feature in contemporary politics mrs ward is always well up to date in her appreciation of  movements young sir george tressady enters parliament in this spirit and attaches himself to a fourth party led by a certain lord fontenoy whose prototype is not far to seek though it must be said that he only slightly resembles this deceased statesmanwhich is bitterly opposed to the conservative government of the day a rather socialistic body among whom the leading figure is our former friend aldous raeburn now lord maxwell of course therefore mar i celia comes upon the scene in fact she 1 occupies it and is almost as much the heroine of this book as she was of the one  which bears her name at first tressady  is strongly opposed to marcellas way of looking at things and prejudiced against her personally almost at the beginning of the book he marries a certain letty  sewell representative of all that is narrow i minded and vulgar in a privileged class j little as george and his wife have in i common in their natures their views are at 1 the outset the same so far as letty can be said to have any views now comes the change an accidental meeting at a country house leads to a growing friendship between tressady and marcella on her side it never gets beyond the pity of seeing a naturally fine intellect and character cramped and pledged to the wrong cause with him it grows into a passion of devotion of which his wife has good cause to be jealous in this way we have a double motive running through the story  mrs ward almost always has two parallel threadsthe motive of tressadys conversion or halfconversion from the old tory doctrine  power to the capable and strong to a fuller recognition of the hardships and the claims of manual labour and therewith that of his personal conversion to swell the ranks of marcellas devotees it ends in tressadys throwing over his party at a critical division and retiring from politics it also ends in his confessing in a moment of abandonment his romantic love to marcella and as at the same moment letty has gone the length of writing to lord maxwell this modern madame roland is suddenly brought face to face with the fact that she has unwittingly carried disaster into another mans married life very beautifully she humbles herself before the vulgarminded letty tressady and in a great degree repairs the mischief that has been done but sir george is spared the  cursed spite  of being obliged to struggle for ever with the disjointedness of his world he takes part in a rescue down one of his mines and is killed by the falling in of the roof much of all this history is finely conceived and very moving it makes for edification as mrs wards novels always do a great deal of the machinery of the talethe side characters the scenes and dialogues  is admirably contrived and obviously at the expense of great pains and it is an unpleasant task to have to point to the serious drawbacks in the book as a whole what in reality makes mrs ward such a puzzle is that her work is so strangely made up of good and bad the greatest failure in the present case is in the character of marcella marcella boyce seemed a fenuine creation marcella maxwell has egenerated into a schoolgirls heroine a bundle of perfections neither more nor less she is precisely the personage who ought to have been as she was wanting only two steps in the peerage given in marriage to a firstclass earl who kept his carriage of course one will be called a cynic for this assertion but if there be any flaw except of the litterofroseleavesanddinofnightingales order which prevents marcella maxwell being put down as a perfect beauty a perfect wife a perfect mother a perfect philanthropist ana a perfect great lady we do not know where it is to be discovered this is more than a grave it is in a certain sense a fatal error in spite of ben jonson it is precisely the growing like a tree growing invisibly in the thoughts of an author or visibly in his or her writings that makes a character of fiction better or worsethat distinguishes in fact between the created and the manufactured personage of a tale and allows you as no other test does to draw the line between the bestemployed talent and genius think of balzacs people or of thackerays of the grandeur et decadence either of cesar birotteau or of colonel newcome think of ethel or clive of dobbin or hawdon crawley of beatrix esmond baroness bernsteiu this reappearance of marcella therefore is terribly enlightening we frankly confess that the old marcella seemed to us when first we made her acquaintance a complete creation a vital being now looking back and asking ourselves of what she has been stripped to turn her into the superhuman and therefore nonhuman lady maxwell we do not find very much  plenty of opinions but of character not an abundance it is rather we take it as a result than as a cause of this lack of the winged gift of the true creator that mrs ward is able to introduce so much we will not say of teaching but of illustration into her books if her people were more alive they would take the bit between their teeth and refuse to do the things they were wanted to do to illustrate some phase of national tendency or some preconceived theory of the way character developes one might in addition cite a hundred small but speaking instances to prove that our author never forgets her audienceas for example where in the scene of sir georges death she takes care to mention that his message was delivered to letty that passage alone would show that she had not lost herself in her art indeed this whole final scene moving though it is has the air of something written up as if the author had encountered elsewhere a scene conceived on the same lines and said to herself  i can do that too  sir george flvssady by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co in sir george tressady mrs humphry ward has seen fit to test the sincerity of our admiration for the central character of one of her former works by introducing marcella as the dca ex mach ina of her present novel charming though she was on though occasion of our first acquaintance a doubt is born as to whether her reappearance has added anything to our store of pleasant memoriesthe question of sequel in fiction being one not often attended by success several factors combining to render the result as a ride experimental one important reason doubtless is the proverbial fickleness of readers themselves while another may possibly lie in the writers own attitude towards even the most wellconceived and carefully developed personage of the imagination in though interval of presentation a marked change may have taken place in his own interest therein all that was freshest and best having furnished the impulse to the first effort marcella called to do duty again does in a measure redeem our expectation even at times exciting some of the old witchery yet the spark which woke her to life in the story of her youth seems lacking in this record of marcella married and marcella turned politician we view her now from an outside standpoint which admits of coldest criticism she is no longer a wayward noble stumbling lovable girl but is summarised heartlessly and with some emphasis as a political intriguante implying the unscrupulous coquette she may be as earnest as intense as beautiful as loving towards poor humanity as faithfully devoted to her husbands interests as ardent a parliamentarian as the old marcella would have been when developed by her new surroundings but the germ is wanting and only a wellarticulated marionette animated by overmuch pulling remains that sir george tressadys parliamentary upsetting to say nothing of his domestic undoing should indirectly hinge upon this character in whom we have least belief would indicate a fallingoff in the authors further development of marcella it were ungracious to dwell further upon this point when a debt of gratitude remains yet unacknowledged mrs ward having introduced many new and several wellobserved characters in whom thc first interest of the general leader will centre letty especially sir georges wife is brilliantly portrayed showing both skill and delicate insight in though handling whatever her phases and there are many she carnes conviction which is though best perhaps that can be said of any of those who speak and move in the pages of fiction her small ambitions and petty triumphs her little prettinesses the utter inability of her poor soul to rise above the height of her husbands shoestrings her lack of sympathy with all outside the most limited of social belongingsall appear in such light as to prove her reality she embodies the dainty pretty heartless society creature whom everyone knows so well and who is so often illpaired with a sir george of ones acquaintance letty is certainly alive more the pity for wherever she is one may be sure she is bruising the heart of some earnest man sir george himself is interesting wc like him so well that we wish ho had never befooled himself even for the brief moment of his infatuation with marcella every scene with his wifeand those with bin vain prodigal deceitful dying motherbear the stamp of truth thora are no false lines here no rubbing out no substitution no blur all is direct sufficient needful from beginning to end mis ward hits shown her knowledge of the man and grasp of his position the downfall of his ambitions his hampered domestic life with it  fretting money anxieties nnd the undcrcunent of real unhappiness ring true wo realise the soreness of his heart and dwell with him in sympathy of the minor characters there is little reason to speak some are good and some unconvincing but taken as a whole mrs ward has not lost ground by her present work rather does she steadily hold

surgeons son  but her chief nobility consists in her readiness to comply with her fathers request that she shall marry somebody else and so be spiritually related to one husband and actually bound to

counting though months that follow a marriage and in though course of his novel he brings enough babies into the world to fill an hospital ward this is new work for a novelist and as most of the novels are now written by yoimg ladies mr jeaffreson can follow it without risk of much dangerous rivalry  a xnde woman new novkts by john cordy jeaffreson 3 vols hurst  blackett  tins book might more appropriately be called a nollie mau for the goodness and generosity of a niau are the main themes ot the story and the worth of his sacrifices stands in contrast with the euiitnentul uselessness of all that the bior heroine does at a great cost to herself ut though heroine noble woman though she may be is only a thread in the story and not though most important one she takes the proportions she would really have for in real life even heroines do not come into very marked prominence mr jeatlresons present work is a very pleasant book to read it has the air of being a real narrative rather than a novel there is excellent portraiture of life in an english county town with its small gentilities anil grave respect for county families the genial sunshiny peaceful lifepeaceful without stagnation and sunshiny without any sentimentalitv of pastoral innocence the careers of the two men who ave the chief personages in the book are worked out to their natural end and admiral devisd the moral pointed by the talc is one much needing to le enforced in the present daythat worldly success is a mere shell without any satisfaction unless tilled and animated hy prosperity of soul which alone makes men rich this moral is not impressed by words but is made tangible by deeds and the story 1ms a healthy genuine reality which makes it channing stapleton and kingsford are friends the one isa country surgeon in good practice  the other is the eldest son and heir of hercules kingsford senior of coote hall banker and lawyer w ho in right of his true blue toryism considers himself a county man there is also a dissenter a radical of the old turbulent type named kilderbee cornelius kilderbee a winemerchant by trade a humorist and something moroevidently a real personage he hates the kingsfords root and branch not without good cause for they had done their best in the good old tory times to ruin him for political reasons or as he expressed it  make a felon of him in spite of persecution he had thriven and as his old enemy observed bitterly for every kick that the kingsfords had given him he had given a bite in return which from a man who held it as a creed that  a blow should j always leave a mark was only a natural result  this old man kilderbee has a niece in whom his heart is wrapped up she is lovely and womanly in her ways and stapleton loves her with all his heart stapleton tells his friend young kingsford of his hopes his friend replies by congratulations by prophecies of success and words of encouragement stapleton goes to the uncle of bessie tells him his intentions finds that it is a favourite project which the old man has long cherishedhis regard for stapleton dating from the days before j stapleton was born when his father stood by kilderbee and became bail for him to the bench of tory magistrates who were about to send him to prison and who had refused to accept a dissenter as bail for in those good old times  no churchman ever thought of entering a dissenters shop and no nonconformist could have shown himself at a parish dinner without causing a tumult this brave generosity from stapletons father who thereby had put all his practice as the county doctor in peril secured the gratitude of the whimsical old man and this kind action had secured a staunch friend to the son kilderbee gives a joyful consent to the young mans wooing but the young man finds that in the interval of the two days since he confided in his friendthat friend who had for two years been making secret love to bessie always stopping short of a  declaration had proposed to her and been gladly and lovingly accepted the character of hercules kingsford and his conduct in this matter are very clearly indicated  the mixture of baseness cowardice mercenary dealing with an infusion of real attachment to the girl so far as he was capable of it is given with a masterly touch and a knowledge of human nature that is skilfully displayed as well as true in itself hercules kingsfords character was a difficult one to draw so as to bc at onco true and yet redeemed from being altogether detestable poor bessie is only a type of many another woman who having the chance of the better man chooses the worse with a loyal infatuation which almost succeeds in imparting reality to its own fond inventions stapleton shows the stuff that true love is made of he stands bessies friend with her uncle and secures her happiness he stands bessies friend through life his own marriage his relations with his own wife with the woman he had loved are given with freshness and truth it is difficult to believe that stapleton is the creation of a novelist wo believe him to bo one of those just men who keep the world together and make it a habitable place in spite of successful impostors like kingsford bessie is a charming woman notwithstanding her mistake in choosing the wrong man  the wife of stapleton is a good woman and an excellent mother and her sons rise up to do her honour but neither of these is the noble woman of the story bessie has one child a little daughter the delight of old comee kilderbees heart who has her christened geraldine and geraldine grows up to be a delightful young woman the old uncle true to his creed of never forgetting either a friend or an enemy makes a will which is to be a practical wrong upon the man who has married his niece to all appearance the money is left to bessies husband in reality it is all bequeathed by a secret deed to the little geraldine and stapleton is the trustee the man kilderbee hated cannot touch one farthing the story up to the period when geraldine attains her majority is as interesting as a story need be with a truthfulness of narrative that gives the reader the sense that the characters are all real people a great deal takes place of which we have not the space to give an account amongst other things geraldines father has married a second wife the sister of his bank partner domestic treachery has undermined his apparent prosperity all is well prepared for the event there is a son some years younger than geraldine and born after the death of comee kilderbee the strong attachment and object of her life he is a goodfornothing worthless young man but geraldine believes in him her first thought on knowing that she is an heiress is to make a position for her brother to give him all the fortune which she thinks he ought to have had how her father driven to the verge of ruin under the appearance of brilliant prosperity trades and traffics upon his daughters love and dutyhow not content with getting her money he works upon her to sacrifice herself in marriage though he knows her affections are given to a man well worthy of herhow both the father and the partner treat her as a piece in a game of chessis all true enough and well told it is a domestic drama that has been played in real life as well as in novels mr jeaffreson had a right to work up the incidents for a passage in his novel but we entirely dissent from the use he has made of them to illustrate the character of a  noble woman a woman to be  noble  must have common sense and that still rarer quality in a woman a sense of justice in acceding to her fathers demands that she should marry felix vincent geraldine does what a young girl might have been overruled into yielding but no woman come to the age of fiveandtwenty like geraldine would have flung over a man to whom she had pledged herself though no formal engagement subsisted mr jeaffreson shows a confusion of judgement in managing this portion of his story which wc should not have expected from him he lowers his heroine in the opinion of the reader and he degrades her character there was her old friend stapleton who could have helped her with counsel and she never asked him in the uncontrolled possession of an immense fortune she could have bought herself off but like a roman catholic devotee she is made to believe that suffering for sufferings sake adds a virtue to all actions she deliberately accepts a position false in itself false towards her friend false towards the man she loves,ovel_contra

are handed down to him in a form so beautiful as this and under an editorship so thorough as this so careful and so loving that potentate to whom poor stevensons eyes were turned down i to though very last in the paradisal prison which he longed to immortalize is a whimsical prince who has the illbred habit of ignoring the physical part of a book and attending only to the spiritual who will cherish indeed the worst edited volume in the english tonguethe folio shakespeare of 1623and leave covered with dust the works of ben jonson carefully edited by ben himself can he be coaxed by all this sumptuousness of type and paper into accepting robert louis stevenson as a classic delighted indeed should we be to believe it for it would be sad to think that he who used to sit late i into the night  toiling to leave a memory behind him failed in an aspiration which though not the noblest is still perhaps noble moreover it would be pleasant to think that all the affectionate solicitude of his friends to win for him the princes suffrages was not thrown away that stevenson had the kind of genius which manifests itself in a strong magnetic personality is made clear now that his voice is still by the loyalty of his friends would that the memory of certain other dead men we could namemen greater than he  had encountered the same loyalty  dead as living no writer surely has owed so much to the affection of friends as stevenson every writing man may be said to begin life well who has the good luck to be born north of the tweed scotchmen are sufficiently few in number to be legitimately clannish and they never fail to exercise their right second to his own fame every scot has the fame of every other scot at heart even carlyle gloried in the  waverley novels  until sir walter seemed to snub him when straightway he found them barren no doubt if this clannishness were resented in england matters would not run so smoothly with the writing scot but englishmen are too many to be clannish themselves and they take with a smile the quaint doings of the mutual admiration society beyond the tweed in london stevenson had at his feet a group of english pressmen who proclaimed him to be the great novelist of the agea sort of sublimated walter scott it was refreshing to hear them at first the cry was  scott and stevenson  at last it was  stevenson and scott yea the greatest imaginative writer that has appeared in great britain since shakespeare died was compared and to his disadvantage with a novelist whose characters already are fainting in the struggle for life for oven now within three years of his death the public writers seem to be able to remember only two  dr jekyll and mr hyde stevenson has style said these loving brothers of the pen  and remember that scott has none cobbett when prostrated by pessimistic thoughts about the future of the british constitution exclaimed  thank god we have a house of lords and in the same way did many a literary student when inclined to pessimistic misgivings about the lovely nature of the writing man exclaim  thank god we have stevenson and the savile club not even the sweetness of stevensons disposition could have saved him from friends like these had it not been for his stock of common sense of this sweetness of disposition and of this good sense we could quote many instances but let one suffice when  kidnapped appeared although in reviewing it we enjoyed the great pleasure of giving high praise to certain parts of that delightful narrative we refused to be scared by stevensons friends from making certain strictures it occurred to us that while some portions of the story were full of that organic detail of which scott was such a master and without which no really vital story can be told it was not so with certain othor parts from this we drew the conclusion that the book really consisted of two distinct parts two stories which stevenson had tried in vain to weld into one we surmised that the purely jacobite adventures of balfour and alan breck were written first and that then the writer anxious to win the suffrages of the general novelreader whose power is so great with byles the butcher looked about him for some story on the old lines that he experienced great difficulty in finding one ana that he was at last driven upon the old situation of the villain uncle plotting to make away with s  the nephew by kidnapping him and sending him off to the plantations the athenaum whose kindness towards all writers poets and prosemen great and small has won for it such an infinity of gratitude said this but in its usual kind and gentle way this aroused the wrath of the stevensonians yet we were not at all surprised to get from the author of kidnapped himself a charming letter from which the following sentences may be given   i wish to thank you for your notice of  kidnapped and that not because it was kind though for that also i valued it but in the same sense as i have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers  you who fight the good fight contending with stupidity and i would fain hope not all in vain  in my own case for instance surely not in vain what you say of the two parts in  kidnapped was felt by no one more painfully than by myself i began it partly as a lark partly as a potboiler  and suddenly it moved david and alan stepped out from the canvas and i found i was in another world but there was the cursed beginning and a cursed end must be appended and an old friend byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door so it had to go into the world one part as it does seem to me alive one part merely galvanised  no work only an essay for a man of tentative method and weak health and a scarcity of private means and not too much of that frugality which is the artists proper virtue the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden the days of professional literature very hard yet i do not so far deceive myself as to think i should change any character by changing my epoch the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves  and my  kidnapped  was doomed while still in the womb and while i was yet in the cradle to be the thing it is thoroughly characteristic of stevenson are these words and it is because of thisamiability of hisno less than on account of his talentsthat we sincerely hope he may leave that memory behind him which he toiled to leave and yet we tremble to think of the provoking way time has of making short work with novels for the fieldings scotts brontes thackerays dickenses and george eliots that survive think of the host whose very captains such as bulwer disraeli ainsworth g p r james wilkie collins trollope are half forgotten nor is the reason of this far to seek though it may not be exactly true that each generation demands to be represented by its own poet it seems that even in regard to poetry a live dog is better than a dead lion if his voice is attuned to the convolutions of the contemporary ear but it is largely true that in the widespreading valley of prose literature at the foot of parnassus each generation demands to be represented by its own novelists and turns away from all but the very few among the novelists of previous time for one great difference between a poem and a novel is undoubtedly this that a poem ho wsoever humble professes to be and is a work of art written primarily for the poets own delectation  offered indeed as a medium through which he would fain express that ego so dear to him but a novel howsoever full of literary qualities is primarily a manufacture for a marketa fact which scott frankly confronted though perhaps not quite so frankly as does the novelist of the present hour who improving even upon the advertising methods of the late illustrious author of  the mysteries of london instructs the interviewer or paragraphist in his or her employ to inform though world of the number of copies printed the rate of the royalty hisor her publisher allows per copy and the amount of the publishers chequedoes this as regularly as the directors of a jointstock business give their balancesheet to the world we have no quarrel with all this we merely state the fact that as patent soap mustard liver pills and novels are nowa days in the same category the manufacturers of these commodities must allow prince posterity to have his marketing done for himself we have been led to dwell at some length upon this subject through an embarrassing consciousness that what we are about to say upon stevensons work may vex and hurt those fervid and tooloving souls who as we have shown above are more stevensonian than stevenson himself let our excuse be that it is though aim of this journal and always has been to exercise a twofold function in criticism although its main business week by week has been to give an account and a brief criticism of the literature of the hour it has also aspired when occasion arose to take up a higher groundin a word it has aspired to deal with those laws of cause and effect in literary art which are unchangeable and eternal and when a place has been claimed for a contemporary writer in the classic literature of the world it has triedhonestly and faithfully tried according to its lights to find a proper place for him but then it must be remembered that in exercising these two functions it often becomes necessary to apply to one and the same writer canons of criticism of two opposite kinds that loose leniency of judgement which may he rightly exercised when the critic has only to balance one work of contemporary fiction with another would be quite out of place when in discussing an edition like this a writers entire works are confronted in order that his proper place may be found in the field of uni versal criticism take for instance the little story  dr jekyll and mr hyde the laudatory criticism upon which is in bulk as regards the story itself like the comets tail in relation to though comet on its appearance as a story a shilling shocker for the railway bookstalls the critics attention was directed to its vividness of narrative and kindred qualities and though perfectly conscious of its worthlessness in the world of literary art he might well be justified in comparing it to its advantage with other tories of its class and literary standing but when it is offered as a classicand this is really how it is offered  it has to be 1 udged by critical canons of a very different ind it has then to be compared and contrasted with stories having a like motive stories that deal with an idea as old as the oldest literatureas old no doubt as those primaeval days when man awoke to the consciousness that he is a moral and a responsible beingstories whose temper has always been up to now of the loftiest kind it is many years since in writing of the parables of buddhaghosha it was our business to treat at length of the grand idea of mans dual nature and the many beautiful forms in which it has been embodied we said then that from the lovely modern story of arsene houssaye where a young man starting along lifes road sees on a lawn a beautiful girl and loves her and afterwardswhen sin has soiled him finds that she was his own soul stained now by his own sin and from the still more impressive though less lovely modern story of edgar poe 4 william wilson up to the earliest allegories upon the subject no writer or storyteller had dared to degrade by gross treatment a motive of such universal appeal to the great heart of the  great man mankind we traced the idea as far as our knowledge went through calderon back to oriental sources and found as we then could truly affirm that this motivefrom the ethical point of view the most pathetic and solemn of all motiveshad been always treated with a nobility and a greatness that did honour to literary art manu after telling us that single is each man born into the world  single dies implores each one to collect virtue in order that after death he may be met by the virtuous part of his dual self a beautiful companion and guide in traversing that gloom which is so hard to be traversed fine as this is it is surpassed by an arabian story we then quoted since versified by sir edwin arnoldthe story of the wicked king who met after death a frightful hag for an eternal companion and found her to be only a part of his own dual nature the embodiment of his own evil deeds and even this is surpassed by that lovely allegory in arda yiraf in which a virtuous soul in paradise walking amid pleasant trees whose fragrance was wafted from god meets a part of his own dual nature a beautiful maiden who says to him 0 youth i am thine own actions and we instanced other stories and allegories equally beautiful in which this supreme thought has been treated as soetically as it deserves it was left for tevenson to degrade it into a hideous tale of murder and whitechapel mystery a story of astonishing brutality in which the separation of the two natures of the mans soul is effected not by psychological development and not by the awful alchemy of the spiritworld beyond the grave as in all the previous versions but by the operation of a dose of some supposed new drug if the whole thing is meant as a horrible joke in imitation of de quinceys  murder considered as one of the fine arts it tells poorly for stevensons sense of humour if it is meant as a serious allegory it is an outrage upon the grand allegories of the same motive with which most literatures have been enriched that a story so coarse should have met with the plaudits that dr jekyll and mr hyde met with at the time of its publication  that it should now be quoted in leading articles of important papers every few days while all the various and beautiful renderings of the motive are ignored  what does it mean is it a sign that the shrinkage of the world the solidarity of civilization making the record of each days doings too big for the day has worked a great change in our public writers  is it that they not only have no time to think but no time to read anything beyond the publications of the hour is it that good work is unknown to them and that bad work is forced upon them and that in their busy ignorance they must needs accept it and turn to it for convenient illustration  that stevenson should have been impelled to write the story shows what the  suicide club had already shown that underneath the apparent health which gives such a charm to  treasure island and kidnapped there was that morbid strain which is so often associated with physical disease had it not been for the influence upon him of the healthiest of all writers since chaucerwalter scottstevenson might have been in the ranks of those pompous problemmongers of fiction and the stage who do their best to make life hideous it must be remembered that he was a critic first and a creator afterwards he himself tells us how critically ho studied the methods of other writers before he took to writing himself no one really understood better than he hesiods fine saying that the muses were born in order that they might be a forgetfulness of evils and a truce from cares no one understood better than he jouberts saying  fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality in literature the one aim is the beautiful once lose sight of that and you have the mere frightful reality and for the most part he succeeded in keeping down the morbid impulses of a spirit imprisoned and fretted in a crazy body save in such great mistakes as dr jekyll and mr hyde and a few other stories stevenson acted upon jouberts excellent maxim but scott and scott alone is always right in this matterright by instinct he alone is always a delight if all art is dedicated to joy as schiller declares and if there is no higher and more serious problem than how to make men happy then the waverley novels are among the most precious things in the literature of the world it is in literary criticism especially that though wise man refuses to prophesy unless he knows and no man knows anything about what the future will do with any writer or any book but in the long run the work of every artist in imaginative literature from homer to dickens is remembered by his characters and by his characters alone and the secret of the characterdrawing of the great masters seems to be this while moulding the character from broad general elements from universal types of humanity they are able to delude the readers imagination into mistaking the picture for real portraiture and this they achieve by making the portrait seem to be drawn from particular and peculiar individual traits instead of from generalities and especially by hiding away all purposes  aesthetic ethic or political stevenson as a critic was fully conscious of this law of imaginative art one great virtue of the great masters stevenson appreciated to the full their winsome softness of touch in character drawing we are not fond of comparing literary with pictorial art but between the work of the novelist and the work of the portrait painter there does seem a true analogy as regards the hardness and softness of touch in the drawing of characters in landscape painting that hardness which the general public love is a fault but in portrait painting so important is it to avoid hardness that unless the picture seems to have been blown upon the canvas as in the best work of gainsborough rather than to have been laid upon it by the brush the painter has not achieved a perfect success in the imaginative literature of england the two great masters of this softness of touch in portraiture are addison and sterne three or four hardlydrawn lines in sir roger or the two shandys or corporal trim would have so completely ruined the portraits that they would never have come down to us close upon addison comes fielding and then scott in whose vast gallery almost every portrait is painted with a gainsborough softness scarcely one is limned with those hard lines which are too often apt to mar the glorious work of dickens after scott comes thackeray unless it be mrs gaskell we are not in this article dealing with or even alluding to contemporary writers or we might easily say what novelists follow mrs gaskell whether or not stevensons instinct was for hardness or softness of touch though  new arabian nights show that he did not at first achieve softness his imagination though not robust was fine and it was based on reason he was always able to give a good account of his incidents and ready to do so in a letter now before us he says speaking of the fight on board the covenant in  kidnapped david and alan had every advantage on their side position arms training a good conscience  a handful of merchant sailors not well led in the first attack not led at all in the second could only by an accident have taken the round house by attack  and since the defenders had fire and arms and food it is even doubtful if they could have been starved out the only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught i half believe they would not but with all his undoubted talents and with all his 6tudy of and insight into the artistic methods of the masters has stevenson created any characters so new and so true that they will take their places in the great portrait gallery of classic english fiction  certainly there are one or two that ought to live if room can be found for them among these we are not sure that we can place alan breck he is delightful but a delightful bit of sir walters imagination if the master of ballantrae does not survive it will bo parti because of hardness of touch except for the feeble impression that the character made upon the critics who must in some degree be taken to express the general feeling we should have prophesied a long life for catriona she is a perfectly delightful character delightfully rendered though discussion of stevensons poetry we must

at this time for the occasion of the present notice i the pulblication of the first four volumes only of the new pentland edition of stevcnsons collected works the first volume opening w ith the  inland voyage and the last tjming to a cloe with the new arabian nights that is to say the present issue comlrises the journeyman work of thle writer already master of his tools but still uncertain how bet to employ them and yet the last volume of these preliminary exercise w hich contains the short stories of 1s77 sowu unmitakably in what direction the writer will exhibit hls strength i do not understand why the title of the new arabian nights was extended to tlhe pavilion n the linksi7 a lodging for the night the sire de malktrolt dour and providence and the guitar it surely an lelong only to the suicide club  and the rajas diamond tlhe other tales have no link with these nor are thley in the same genre and the blunder is unfortunate as the greater stories are thus named of the less the modernisation of the caliph haroun alraschid was an adventurous idea brilliantly carried out it puslies one step further into capital farce tennysons identification of king arthur uith a certain english gentleman of stateliest port but the tories themselves a mixture of melodrama and burlesque have not the remotet air of realit and hardly bear a second reading moreover the suicide club  contains ne picture thlat of mr malthus of such a nightmare horriblenes that it would not have passed the censor in any community of utopia there must have been a strain of lbrutalitv tomehere in stevenons fine natuie which cropped out once and again even in the later books  the body snatcher publihed ave the mark as a christmas stoi was the ornl tale in which thlis strain predominated  but the character of old pew in  treasure island and mfr hvde the alter teo of lr jekyll are imaginations that ought not to have been imagined plato we mav le sure would have invited their creator to leave ills commonwealth at the earlict posoille moment however this strain in the nature if i maw put it so wa for the most part kept well in check by mor e gentle anld humane qualities there are strong cen  stark characters enough in other talesnorthmour for examjle in thle pavilion on the links and the fraudulent banker huddletone in the same story is as much as mr malthus a study in the psychology of fear but these characters are well within the limits of literary decency the pavilion on the links indeed has all the qualities which combine to make the true stevenson there is the landscape so well drawn and so completely in key with the beauty or horror of the situation  there is the single vivid incident etched in with acid sharp and unforgettablein this case the noise of the wet finger on the windowpane without and the voice that shouted traditore through the shutters there is the wholesomeness of the sentiment  in the aristotelian sense of thle word  and there is the perfection of thle phraning the romantic tale of the strange courtship that weent on in the two hours before dawn inside the  sire de imaltroits oor  is singularly beautiful and unlike anything elc in fiction and then there are those charming french  artits in  providence and the guitar studied it would seem from a brokerdown actor and his wife full of sentiment described in the  inland oyage who preaclh tlat christian lesson which stevenson was never tired of inculcating that the life of a man does not consit in the abundance of things which he possesses finally there is a lodging for the night with its two scenes in the inn parlour and the lord of brisetouts kotel i do not believe that villon was as stevenson has represented him a compound of wolf and pig with some unexplalned calacity for making lballades but with no capacity fior seeing anything in his chivalrous host for the night but a very dull old gentleman the philosophy of revolt against societv which stevenson has elsewhere expounded should have saved him from such a lapse of critical imagination but strike out the name of the poet and one can enjoy to the full the vividnes of the contrast between the two scene and the wintry paris landscape that unites them the mention of villon brings me to speak of the only part of stevenon early writing which seem to fail of its mark and that i the critical work collected into  familiar studic of men and books stevenson in his humble lpreface recognie his tendency to depreciate a curious fault in an exponent of the philosophy of looking always on the better side but stevenson was not built for a critic his imagination was always at work on the material that came before him for study what seemed a striking saying summoned up in his mind a vivid picture of the man who would say such a thing and this became for him the man s true portrait but if the saying was really but an obiter dictum not really characteristic or if by some chance it had been misinterpreted then the whole character was miread i do not believe as i have said in the character drawn of francois villon most scotsmen fail to see the likeness in the portrait of burns but with that controveraan englishman had better not intermeddle but any reader of pepys diary  can see that stevensons  little sensualist in a periwig  is far enough from the truth about that interesting person it may be worth while to indicate a few points in which the painter has misrepresented his sitter because when a great artist paints a portrait we are apt to take the lifelikeness for granted and also because stevenson believed he had done pepys something more than justice take for a very clear example of misrepresentation the passage about the relations of pepys with william pen the quakermeanwhile there was growing up next door to him that beautiful nature william pen it is odd that pepys condemned him for a fop odd though natural enough when you see pens portrait that pepys was jealous of him with his wife but the cream of the story is when pen publishes his  sandy founda tion shaken and pepys has it read aloud by his wife i find it he savs  so well writ as i think it is too good for him ever to have writ it and it is a serious sort of book and not fit for cverybody to read tht italics are stevensons nothing is more galling to the mnerely respectable than to be brought in cortact with religious ardour pepys had his own foundation sandy enough but dear to him from practical considerations and he would read the book with true uneasiness of spirit for conceive the blow if

would find that what he thought dangerous in it wovas not its enthusiasm but its heresy this is the passage  pelling bath got me wl pens book against the trinity i got my wife to read it to me etc the title of the book was  the sandy foundations shaken or those doctrines of one god subsisting in three distinct and separate persons etc refuted from the authority of scripture testimonies and right reason so that all stevensons very cynical commentary on the words not fit for everybody to read rests on a simple misunderstanding or take another point pepys buys a i roguish french book and notes in his diary that he bought it in plain binding meaning to burn it when read  that it may not stand in the list of books nor among them to disgrace them if it should be found stevenson paraphrases this  he is full of precautions to conceal the disgrace of the purchase but pepyvs is writing as a collector with a respect to the dignity of his library he is not even considering the question about the morality or immorality of reading  roguish  books so again stevensons idea that pepys was a sort of leaf insect who took his moral colour from his neighbours and was only virtuous when under the influence of sir william coventry is not supported by the diary coventry was no better than his contemporaries in regard to the seenth commandment and in regard to the eighth we find him more than once making a sort of apologia to pepys or once more what ground is there for stevensons wild idea that pepys intended his diar to be one day made public  i the greatness of his life he says  was open yet he longed to communicate its smallness also and while contemporaries bowed before him he must buttonhole posterity with the news that his periwig was once alive with nits i confess lively writing of this sort whet it belittles the characters of the dead without a spark of evidence makes me angry stevenson quotes the solemn sentence with which the diary closes but if he had raised his eves to the sentence next before it he would have found that it disposed of his theory  and thus ends all that i doubt i shall ever be able to do with my own eves in the keeping of my journal i being not able to do it any longer having done now so long as to undo my eves almost every time that i take a pen in my hand and therefore whatever comes of it i must forbear and therefore resolve from this time

my book open to add here end there a note in shorthand with my own hand young entlemen with a genius for style should be warned oxf riticism the valuable part of stevensons writing outside his stories  that in which he writes about himself about himself aid his travels and his meditations on men and things we could niever have too much because he looked at the world with tresh eyes i have a fancy for testing a mans powers of natural description by his handling of a snowstorm iand i remember the joy it gave me years ago to come upon this passage of our author the snow fell with rigorous

travel books natural description is kept in due subordination to the proper study of mankind and there as in the moral essays wie find stevenson acclaiming with joy mans imperfect virtues and calling upon every body to take up the great task of being happy themselves anti making others happp quotation would be an endless luxury but one passage may be allowed which we may well believe seemed to its author the conclusion of the whole matter certainly for himselfall who have meant good vork with their wvhole hearts have done good work although they may die before they have the time to sign it

B7067,"['8940843', '2440875']",  princes8 helene von racowitza8 auto i biography translated from the ger i man by cecil mar constable  co princess helene von racowrtzas autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of george merediths novels and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of the tragic comedians in the memorial edition of his works it is now rather more than thirty years since the princess published that account of her relations with lassalle upon which meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained his explanation brilliant and masterly as it was omitted a very important factor after all the strangest action of the heroine of the story was not her submission to her familywhich had it been the action of one of his own heroines meredith would conceivably have praised nor yet her marriage with the luckless yanko for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion and a somewhat too com placent champion of her own part in the affair clotilde the princess as meredith represents her would have been both too astute and too selfconscious to have committed this astounding blunder but the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked lassalle whether the countess hatzfeld would have to live with them an incident omitted by mere dith who no doubt thought it an in vention of the princesss and the first thing to recognise about clotildes original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing in a spirit of in genuousness verging upon fatuity  this she writes of her present volume ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child the autobiography then convinces us that the story of  the tragio comedians like that of another lady of high distinction for wit and beauty curiously enough merediths next is to be read as fiction  nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them though not a few are discoverable the whole course of the princess helenes life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with clotildes she was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous dashing manner and she went on her way vaguely drifting spasmodically candid playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures it accepting these in whatever form they offered themselves with open arm while still a child she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life and carried them into practice bw she submitted formally to her parents choice where suitors were concerned s0 that on meeting lassalle when she va nineteen she was the typical  jeune file allemande incapable of selfdirection and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility durng the short period of her engagement to lassalle she wanted she says  to tell him all about my past life and my crimes against saintly morality  but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand no no for heavens sake dont let us have any pompeian excavations   and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the autobiography the pages that treaty of lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume but even without them it would be worth reading so great is the variety of the writers experiences her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed she handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence with the support of course of her exuberant vitality that she adopted at need or was ready to adopt the professions of actress physician artist journalist in turnnot without success or some promise of it in all she was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination and took up flower  painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time indeed there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writers practical ability and common sense it is not less remarkable though less engaging that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth the conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to lassalles death a narrative sincere and poignant but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks is puzzlingly absurd the gigantic edifice of the german empire must always she writes have seemed like a prison  to lassalle  i therefore ask whether we pigmies all of us were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny and need gthe spirit of the worlds history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the empire it is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is

B5275,"['8793124', '8496645']",  max havelaar or thc coffee auctions of thc dutch trading company new novels bv multatuli translated from the original manuscript by baron alphonse nahuys edinburgh edmonston  douglas the dutch haareno doubt a number of valuable possessions in the east indies  that magnificent empire of insulind which avinds about the equator like a garland of emeralds as the favourite phrase runs and thc rest of the world hears so little and what is more cares so little about what is actually taking place that it generally assumes tranquillity and prosperity there go hand in hand and that the dutch a quiet shrewd peaceloving people do knoav j better than any other how to make colonies a source of direct profit rather than a dead loss to the mothercountry but on closer examination j this pleasing assumption proves far from true 1 the dutch so far from avoiding the mistakes which the english spaniards french and  other nations have made in dealing with distant j possessions have reproduced them in even an i exaggerated form and do not seem to have  learned anything since those days when by their j ultraprotectionist commercial policy and their  wish to retain unjust monopolies they rendered  themselves odious to the test of the world  that the bulk of the dutch nation does not  know what is actually going on in their east indian possessions we can well believe the  subject is far too complicated for any ordinary  i man to master even if he has the wish and  j application to do so but the difficulty is 1 much increased by the fact that the indian 1 officials desiring to make things look pleasant  do not or rather are not allowed to furnish  truthful written reports they may make any 1 number of verbal communications to proper j quarters about the extortions cruelties and f crimes of the native chiefs but woe to the a official who dares to put all this on paper his i doom is sealed a mere dismissal from office e j without pension after spending though best part of his life in the sultry regions of the tropics being the least punishment that awaits him it is a fearful alternative that here presents itself such indeed is the drift of  max havelaar the book placed at the head of our notice it professes to be a novel but a novel founded on facts the author of which we are told in the preface has boldly asked the dutch government to prove the substance of it to bo false and at the international congress for the promotion of science at amsterdam challenged his countrymen to refute him but up to this moment no champion has come forward to disprove what is here asserted and hinted at on the contrary mr vcth the wellknown orientalist at leyden who made a special study of indian matters declared that the author understates rather than overstates the truth and quoted vitalis and others who had published accounts of scenes and facts much more shocking than those depicted in  max havelaar the author wrote the book under the pseudonym of multatuli but his real name eduard d dekker formerly assistantresident of the dutch government of java at once became known and the hero of the novel may be said to be an idealised portrait of the author himself max havelaar then a man of superior acquirements finds himself appointed to a district in java as assistantresident or subgovernor and the first thing on his assumption of office is to convoke the native chiefs by whose aid the machinery of government in the dutch indian dependencies is kept going as well as the european official placed under his authority he tells them that he is resolved to do his best to promote the prosperity of the impoverished district over which his jurisdiction extends but that he expects the regent though highest native functionary as well as the other native chiefs will also do their duty and not by cruel extortions drive the population away and render the extension of cultivation a matter of impossibility fully aware of the existing abuses and conscious that the system cannot be overthrown by the efforts of a single combatant he endeavours to win over the regent and others by telling them that he will let bygones be bygones will not be too hard with them at first but at the same time will not tolerate injustice in any shape havelaar soon perceives that his conciliatory policy is of no avail the regents court has a large number of hangerson who commit all sorts of extortion and cruelties towards the natives in the depth of night the boldest of the injured parties steal to havelaars house ami beseech him to protect them from the tyranny of their countrymen but he finds it difficult to do anything for them when he inquires officially into the matter the complainants bearing in mind though punishments awaiting them from the hands of their native rulers for daring to prefer charges against them revoke everything they have said and offer the most humble and abject apologies the assistantresident goes home disgusteel with their cowardly behaviour and the poor complainants arc now subjected to all sorts of cruelties and tortures if indeed they escape with their lives havelaar soon discovers from papers left behind that his predecessor in office has also been a man resolved to do his duty but that he died suddenly how he died is known to his widow who lives near havelaars premises and fearing that the fate which befell her husband may also befall his successor she closely watches and questions every native who comes to the assistantresidents house at first havelaar attributes this to sheer inquisitiveness on her part until she tells him plainly that it is done for his own and his familys protection  in fact that she fears poison may be administered of course life under such circumstances is unbearable and havelaar fully believing that thc head government when made aware of the real state of the district will support him in remedying the evil puts the whole case on record and transmits it to though resident who for years has furnished the stereotyped statement that everything in the district is flourishing and progressing as rapidly as can be expected the latter is much annoyed about this report and desires havelaar to withdraw it but the assistantresident is resolved to stand or fall by it the consequence of this obstiuacy is that he is dismissed and that all attempts to obtain au interview with the governorgeneral for the purpose of justifying his conduct prove abortive havelaar goes to the wall and the poor natives continue to be subjected to the same tyranny us they have always been liable to under dutch rule in order to bring out the views entertained by a section of the commercial world in holland itself about the subject the author introduces a mr drystubble a rich coffeebroker and a great egotist who is supposed to be editing the book and commenting upon the facts and opinions advanced drystubble is u mean contemptible fellow drawn by a masterly hand who we trust may not be the type of a aery large section of the dutch nation the book is avritten with considerable dash and by a man who knows his subject thoroughly it will naturally provoke a good deal of discussion as containing charges of a most compromising nature against the administration of the dutch indian possessionsnot made be it remembered by a foreigner jealous of hollands prosperity but by a dutchman to the backbone anxious to remove what he considers foul blots from the national escutcheon  max hswelaar or the coffee auctions of the dutch trading company by multatuli translated from the original mss by baron alphonse nannys edinburgh  edmonston and douglas this is better than a good book it is a brave one it is an appeal to the public opinion of england as a portion of the public opinion of europe against the wrongs oppression and robbery of the thirty millions of inhabitants of insulind where the king of holland bears sway it is a cry of  stop thief wrung from indignation at the sight of unheeded and disregarded suffering it is an advertisement to europe that  there is a band of robbers between germany and the scheldt it may be said the picture is untrue it is exaggerated it is a libel it is the work of a man who conceives that he has been badly treated by the government that employed him and now seeks revenge by the publication of falsehoods it is not possible for us to say how this may be but we can vouch that every page of  max havelaar has the stamp of truth because it has the fire of virtuous indignation let us hear what multatulii have suffered muchhas to say for himself the real person represented by multatuli is mr douwes dekker who was employed for seventeen years as a functionary in the dutch government of java  and  max havelaar is the name under which the author describes his eastern experiences he has just returned home from insulind as the islands in the indian archipelago are collectively called and meets with a prosperous coffee broker mr drystubblea dutch dryasdust whom he asks as an old schoolfellow to become security for the cost of publishing his book mr drystubble a prosperous tradesman the

drystubble be a representative of the trading class in hollandand as such he seems to be paintedwe feel very much inclined to wish for them the doom invoked in lord tkurlows epigram amphibious creatures speedy be your fall may the sea undana and god damn you all he believed his success in life to be the result of his  fear of god and the commandments he could  retire to his country residence in driebergen and see how it ended with others who forsook the lord  pray and labour  was a maxim of his  but he took the prayer to himself and left  the labour to be done by those who did not know the lords prayer he considered the man who has little sins if he gives anything to another moreover he adds  i never give in the streets that is a principle of mine for i always say when i see such peopleperhaps it is their own fault and i must not encourage them in their wickedness he does not tell us indeed that he sent fifty persons to the city prison with hard labour in amsterdam for begging but he takes care to inform us that  every sunday he gives twiceonce for the poor and once for the church he gives to the poor at the chapel door and robs them overnight such is the character who is drawn as a contrast to  havelaar or as he is contemptuously called hythe rich broker  shawlman because he wore a shawl to keep him warm  havelaar on the other hand is a character of the noblest type with a keen sense of wrong and an ardent desire to remove it by gentle means if possible if not by any amount of selfsacrifice we learn from this volume that thc system of government in java is administered under a dutch governorgeneral by dutch residents dutch assistantresidents controllers lieutenants but besides these there are regents and their followers who are natives these regents have no political power indeed  but they have an immense capacity for fleecing the people who are under them the regent is a kind of  dummy under the shelter of whose social rank and consideration  the coffee and sugar machines called natives  are most brutally treated unpaid labour is exacted buffaloes are carried off the peasants lands  if the unfortunate inhabitants remain at home they are robbed if they run away they are whipped if they take arms they are shot between the dutch upper jaw and the regents nether one the javanese people are ground and triturated till death or insanity brings relief the spirit of the natives is so broken and the punishment of remonstrance or complaint so certain and terrible that neither the victim nor the agent of oppression dares to cry out for redress though dutch residents and underresidents come back and live at ease at home near the hague whilst the everpresent native regents and their deputies are levying black mail to support their feudal and barbaric splendour  havelaar  says that the official reports sent to holland are for the most part untrue and over and over again he challenges inquiry into though accuracy of

and neglected we have dwelled on the political and moral features of this book as the most important if the statements contained in it are true they are most damaging to the dutch government we who know that in our eastern possessions tortures were inflicted by native officials on indian peasants in order to extract taxes from them can have little difficulty in believing the statements of mr dekker directors of our indian trading company flatly denied the statements made in the house of commons by mr danby seymour of the tortures inflicted on the ryots of the madras presidency but these statements were afterwards proved to be true the government of holland were made aware ten years ago of the conduct of the agents of the dutch trading company but they do not appear to have made any inquiry into the accusations of oppression and cruelty brought against the officials of java the form of the book we consider to be inartistio not to say clumsy but the literary ability displayed is very great indeed the tale of said j ah and adinda in chapter xvii is a simple and pathetic story of great beauty it is an oriental pastoral which the author is afraid will be monotonous but which we rather think will touch a chord in every human heart the youthful couple grew up together and they loved but saidjah was poor the regent and his underlings carried off his fathers buffaloes and flogged him besides for running away because he could not pay more taxes so the young saidjah determined to go to batavia to seek a little fortune and he promised to return and meet adinda at a certain hour under the ketapan tree which saw their early loves he has returned and complains in his eagerness that adinda is not there before the appointed hour of meeting and he complained unjustly for neither had the sun risen nor had the eye of day cast a glance on the plain the stars it is true were growing pale up there ashamed as they were of the approaching end of their rule strange colours were flowing over the tonnes of the mountains which appeared darker as they contrasted sharply with places more brightly illuminated  here and there flowed something glowing in the eastarrows

B8926,['8663690'],  johnny robinson the story of the childhood and sclwoldays of an  intelligent artisan by the journeyman engineer 2 vols tinsley brothers  the journeyman engineer who is known favourably to many readers by  some habits and customs of the working classes gives us a picture of the boyhood of a prosperous london artisans child from his infancy to the commencement of his apprenticeship to a working engineer to rouse and hold the readers interest the book makes just no use of the ordinary devices of romantic artists but achieves its purpose by a simple statement of the ordinary experiences of a boy who passes his earlier years in a mechanics home and in the schools generally frequented by the more carefullyreared children of our superior london workmen how johnny robinson fares under the penal hand of a worthy mother the birch of the kindly dame who teaches him his letters and the canes of the masters who ground him in the three fundamental departments of learning is minutely set forth for the enlightenment of leaders who like to study the ways and manners of our poorer classes and for the entertainment of such youngsters as those whom the book describes the characters of johnnys schoolmates are delineated and contrasted with considerable ability and in his enumeration of the moral dangers that beset the humble but respectable lads of our large cities the journeyman engineer  gives us some noteworthy particulars concerning a vicious literature that is specially provided for their entertainment and injury but while the effects of cheap literature have been chiefly beneficial it has like other good things its attendant evils and chiefest among these in the present day is the extensive circulation of the kind of publications classed under the expressive heading of  thieves literature these works which are having a most pernicious effect upon boys in the working class rank of life are published in penny weekly numbers and at the commencement of their present runwhich set in soon after the abolition of the paper dutythey were published under such general but suggestive titles as black bess or the knight of the road and  the dashing highwayman general titles however were soon abandoned and these works now appeal directly to the class whose minds they chiefly corrupt by bearing such titles as  the boy brigand the boy piratethe wild boys of london and others of a like character the sole object of these works is the glorification of all descriptions of vice and criminality the boy hero is invariably represented as a daring and successful criminal leading a life of pleasurable excitement admired and obeyed by men beloved of women and eventually settling down with a rich and beautiful wife and the other rewards generally reserved for the virtuous heroes of ordinary works of fiction the whole tone of such publications ia eminently calculated to turn the spirit of adventure which characterises english boys to their own destruction as it teaches them to emulate not the deeds of great men but of notorious criminals the extent to which these publications circulate can only be fully realised by those inside the working classes and speaking from an intimate acquaintance with these classes i can confidently say that eighty per cent of the boys in this rank of life between eight and fifteen years of age who do read now read works of this class cases in which boys are led to commit robberies through the perusal of these publications are occasionally made known through the medium of the police intelligence but these are a very small proportion of the number of such cases that actually occur such robberies being for the most part from parents who do not as a rule make them public the depredations of the boys who are thus led into crime are committed either with a view to obtaining money wherewith to purchase the books or to carry out the lessons taught in them by setting up as  boy brigands or pirates on their own account and in connexion with this point it may be noticed that there is one feature in the publication of thieves literature that directly tends to induce the classes who are its principal readers to steal with a number of one of them the first two numbers of a new work of the same class is often  given away and these works being written upon the most intense  tobecontinued  principle the result of this dodge is that those who commence to take in one of these works are almost invariably involved into taking several others of the same class asit would beagainstthe nature of a reader of thieves literature to rest content without knowing the result of the  terrible encounter between the boy king of the mountains and the chief of the black bandits at the most exciting part of which the last of the two givenaway numbers of  the boy king of the mountains had terminated and thus it often happens that one boy is taking in five or six of these works at the same time and as the pocketmoney of workingclass boys is too limited in amount to allow of the expenditure of fivepence or sixpence a week in one article and the teaching of the works which they read is in effect that no boy of the least spirit would for a moment hesitate about committing a robbery these boys often resort to dishonest means to raise funds for the purchase of their favourite books what mr hughes accomplished for the boys of our upper ten thousand  the journeyman engineer has achieved for boys of our working classes,ovel_contra

my good man  asked the unblushing tailor putting on his hat which had a piece of crape sewn on the inside to drop over his face as occasion required the keeper was dismayed isle could not speak for very shame as he saw clearly that all his boastings would be disproved the squire wondered  what is the meaning of all this  asked he  its soon told replied lot and he revealed the truth the surprise and indignation of the squire may be conceived but i he loved a joke and could not forbear a laugh  at the piiet qui which the keeper underwent from lot upon his brave resistance to such a  large

which he kept in all  good faith for he is a man of his word on  every occasion the poor keeper hid  his  diminished head and soon left the county  to   be beaten by a tailor was too much for him   old lot is now living in single blessedness  he had a wife who like the rib of lot of yore  was a salt one she was the salt of tartar tand like that preparation was as her bereft  husband says chiefly useful in scouring for  some thirty years she scolded and fumed and  fought as a virago should now with her 1 husband then with her children  and when i amusement grew scarce at home she sought it   among her neighbours who came in for their i share of her volubility in fact she kept the j whole street in hot water she died at length  i it is thought ol a fit of silence having aa ulcer on her tongue occasioned as was said by her acquaintance by incessant use of that member his loss was great but lot was not utterly inconsolable with much philosophy he contented himself hy reflecting that things might have been worse the neighbours were not sorry for her removal they followed her to the grave merely to see if she would lie quiet  a fact which they doubt to this day if a noise is heard

hue however becomes her best as indeed i believe it would most of her sex if they could only think so sometimes she figures as a poodle for lot has procured a skin which he has had dressed and ties upon her with much ingenuity  and as nobody ever suspected a poodle of having a nose for game she skirts the plantations without observation her own tail lias been cut off as you see close and when she assumes the renell garb the tufted tail of the late proprietor of her disguise having a wire through it stands as erect as could he wished the dog really looks not amiss in this dress and was once

overcome by beauty and gold as well as he and after all it was hut punishing an idle folly thc dog was sold lot received the price and requested leave to fasten up the animal in an outhouse lest she should follow him or run away he did so and adroitly returned to the place soon afterwards put the skin in his j pocket cut the rope and away hounded la  dame blanche over the fence after her master i

B4956,"['3204528', '9085145', '6903157']",  the end of her honeymoon by mrs belloc lowndes 6s methuen mrs belloc lowndes has attempted in her latest novel the end of her honeymoon to combine the unravelling of a mystery with the planning of a fascinating novel an endeavour which in some measure detracts from our appreciation of both personally we felt on reading it that the classic remark  how happy would i be with either exactly expressed our sentiments mrs lowndes herself is evidently far happier when she is dealing with the love interest pure and simple than in drawing the villainous characters of the french police the character of her heroine is sketched with a delightfully sure touch which proves that she is as we already know well a keen student of her own sex nancy is altogether charming and very human in her imperfections we love her instinctively yet without knowing why the tragic story which the authoress has woven around the ugly tale which appeared in the newspapers last year of an english ladys disappearance from a paris hotel is in this case converted to chronicle the mysterious loss of one john dampier an artist and poor nancys threeweeks bridegroom the book deals with nancys subsequent adventures and from an artistic point of view we cannot help wishing that the american senator and his very perfect son had not appeared quite so opportunely to aid nancy in her search wve should like to have seen how she would have fared alone but that of course is unkind although when you reach the end and find how very easily nancy consoles herself you are inclined to believe that the unfortunate john dampier is happier out of the way the reader is certain to follow the solving of the mystery with eagerness although when mrs belloc lowndes attempts to make even us credulous folk believe that the entire french police organisation from the charming and courteous pr6fet monsieur beaucourt downwards hid the traces of a mans disappearance and afterwards lied about it simply for the sake of their own prestige it strikes us as a somewhat tall order the story closes by the very perfect american explaining to nancy in the style of mr kiplings hero  youd best take me for your new love a line of action which she is very ready to follow the distinction between the passionate desire of a mans love and the simple need of kindly tenderness so often characteristic of a woman is excellently brought out once you have begun  the end of her honeymoon  you will not want to put it down for mrs belloc lowndes keeps your interest unflagging and you are very properly left in ignorance of john dampiers fate and whether nancy be a wvife or widow until the last few pages  the end of her honeymoon by mrs belloe lowndes methuen  co 6s this is a pleasantly exciting story of the ossibilities and impossibilities of a mans disappearance in paris on the whole the plot is neatly constructed though it is hard to believe that the stranded girl would have blundered so completely over proving her story for instance we have to wait till the eighth chapter before she produces thc address of her old family lawyer and another five before we learn that she bethought herself of the rouen hotel where she had stayed with the lost husband  while tie crucial fact that the carriage in which they both drove away from the gare saint lazare was stopped by thc police and that their identity was noted  the fact which would have prevented the mystery  is not referred to again perhaps that is well for otherwise an eminently readable even absorbing and easily written romance would have been frustrated it is a novel of plot scarcely at all of character only absorption in the mystery could account for the curiously abortive treatment of saigas and the naive confidence shown in the chattering major dallas of scotland yard by the prefect of the french police but all who value a couple of hours recreation should be grateful to mrs belloe lowndes  the end of her honeymoon fiction by mrs belloc lowndes methuen and co 6s there is no doubt that mrs belloc lowndes will sustain the readers interest until the last page of her story is finished but at the same time it seems a pity that an author with the ability of character  drawing which mrs belloc lowndes undoubtedly possesses should turn her attention to detective stories however well developed those stories may be plots counterplots desperate chasing and hunting down of criminals derive their keenest interest from exciting incidents thereby placing careful characterstudy in a secondary positionin a position in fact where a careless retailer of similar wares might learn to dispense with it altogether this of course cannot apply to the present author strange to say the honeymoon in question ends before the first chapter is finished the whole of the remaining pages being taken up with the search for the disappearing bridegroom the scene takes place in paris during the time of a state visit from the russian monarchs french police methods are severely criticised and the whole of the story seems feasible until the final disclosure and clearing up of the mystery from the very beginning the police officials of paris had known the fate of the missing man but on account of the imperial visit secrecy was maintained for a year the young bride and her energetic american friends sought by every means in their power a solution of the problem the police told them nothing although all the time assuring them of their devoted zeal on their behalf yet the whole ghastly affair is related by the prefect himself to a major dallas who happens to be in paris on business it is told quite casually as an incident among others of the manner in which parisian police officials can on occasion muzzle their press with this exception the story is good but we trust that in her next book mrs belloc lowndes will give policemen and detectives a little rest,ovel_contra

jonger and more serious work  mary barton her first novel or  ruth or m wives and daughters or  north and south or those admirable short stories united under the name  round the sofa containing  the poor clare  and  the manchester marriage so it is with great pleasure that we welcome this new and comely edition ot her works which is produced under the direction of pr ward in the preface he explains that he has undertaken the task owing to the express wish of mrs qaskells daughters miss gaskell and miss julia b gaskell and there is certainly no one who could have performed it with equal grace and efficiency the first volume contains his short but illuminating biography and to each successive volume he has written a charming and discriminating introduction  his critical acumen only serves to heighten his devoted reverence for mrs gaskell8 genius and his knowledge of the times and places which she interpreted throws new light upon the beauty of her interpretation in 1838 when mrs gaskell was twentyeight years old and had been married six years she wrote to her friend mrs howett about some work which she had undertaken in collaboration with her husband it is practically her first literary work and in her letter she expressed her aim in doing it this is what she writes we once thought of trying to write sketches among the poor rather in the manner of crabbe now dont think this presumptuous but in a more seeingbeauty spirit and onethe only onewas published in blackwood january 1837 but i suppose we spoke our plan near a dogrose for it never went any further her first novel mary barton was not completed until 1847 ard her manner had changed and developed from the experimental poem but her aim remained for ever the same she wrote and wrote alwayseven to her last work wivesand daughters which was still unfinished at her death in 1865in a seeingbeauty spirit and therein lies her charm and her greatness that spirit was so much part of her nature that there is no straining after the effect of beauty there is nothing desperate about her attitude nothing forced and the circumstances of her life were beautiful fortune cast no shadows across the path of her personal experiences save such as are the lot of mortality  and the tame which suddenly encircled her brow before she had yet passed into middle age was alike unasked and undisturbing    her husband who had won her hand in the days of her beautiful girlhood was the associate ofthe best and highest thoughts of her womanly maturity  and the honoured name that she left was safe in the care of her dearly loved  daughters on such a life who would wish to look back  to it who is not ready to look up  yet sympathy and love enabled her to see the evil and the ugly and the distressing things of life without shrinking  beauty never became suspect she possessed the quiet strength and great courage which are needed to welcome the colour of beauty for that colour often makes the dark moment or the ugly sight by contrast more poignant in its effect a little story of hers called  libbie marshs three eras  shows this peculiar ability with exceptional clearness the spirit informs all her work in the little story it seems crystallised her treatment is exquisite in grace and simplicity we can think of no writer but mrs gaskell who could have held the poise with such nicety a moments lack of grip the slightest hesitation and the story must inevitably fall and fall heavily sordidness and false pathos crouch to catch ber for the story tells of a little crippleboy franky who dies and whose death brings a kind of sweetness to hie mother a crossgrained woman whom her neighbours dislike and establishes a bond between her and libbie marsh the sewinggirl who had come to live in the court and felt very lonely until she sent the little boy a canary as a valentine and became his friend so after his death the two women live together and libbie marsh  but this is mrs gaskells way of moralising do you ever read the moral concluding sentence of  story  i never do but i once in the year 1811 i think heard of a deaf old lady living by herself who did  and as she may have left some descendants with the same amiable peculiarity i will put in for their benefit what i believe to be the secret of her peace ot mind the real reason why she no longer feels oppressed at her loneliness in the worldshe has a purpose in life and that purpose is a holy ope apparent in this sentence lies the quality which saved mrs gaskell from sentimentvoid abysmand that quality is her sense of humour by the side of it george eliots humour pales to bitter wit it is as much part of her character as the seeingbeauty spirit the combination of the two how rarely they go together it ia only necessary to think for a moment to realise form mrs gaskells greatness it gives her the breadth of view which humour alone can give and balanced insight into character and so of the conflicting interests of masters and workpeople of rich and poor her treatment is always masterly and whatever character she touches whether it be the distinguished margaret hale or the unswerving john thorton or the nonconformist minister benson and his sister faith or ruth to whom the bensons give a home or countless others she is always able to endow that character with the charm of lovableness rarely as in the case of bellingham who has betrayed ruth does that quality desert her and at once her touch becomes heavy and her treatment prejudiced and unconvincing it is to mrs gaskell of all the victorian novelists that we turn to find the quiet beauty of victorian life george eliot was a little beyond her time and there was bitterness in her writing the brontes were too individual their novels read like prose rhapsodies on their personal griefs dickens paints with such a grotesque assortment of colours laid on so heavily that his people seem creations of his own genius rather than human beings though they share his tremendous animal spirits disraeli charms and bewilders by his brilliance and displaythe exact opposite of trollope who soothes us with his laborious care mrs gaskell was eminently of her age she alone among them was inspired by what was highest and noblest of her day others were stifled by it like the brontes or loved it and sneered at it liked thackeray or were brilliant at its expense like disraeli she waa kept from sinking into its placidity by her intense sympathy with what was best in it just as the other novelists as is more usual were saved from its lethargy by rebelling against what was worst in it the old order must change but it is delightful to look back on all that was gracious and comely in that old order and perhaps the best thing of that victorian life was the instinct of the family the thief circumstance had spoiled thackerays vision of that the angry man with the hungry look in bis eyesand had embittered george eliot against it without giving her the right solution to the problems which she saw but that family instinct informed mrs gaskells life even as it informed her work with what dr ward delightfully calls her sweet serenity of soul knowledge creates new responsibilities and problems arise quite simply from the effort to adjust these new responsibilities to the old framework now in the creed of the individualist and of the socialist the family is losing its old prestige it is the day of the young the duty cl the old to the young is more regarded than that of the young to the old life has become more complex and superficially it is harder and more material than when mrs gaskell wrote so we turn to mrs gaskell and read her books for their beauty and peace and oldworld kindliness and charm such centuries are

claim to the merits of wise selection and skilful arrangement if not of originality in the highest sense and yet far from being a slavish copyist he has so modified the results supplied to ms hand by

and history of our language accompanied by so clear an exhibition of its structure and laws all comprised within such moderate limits he has done well in introducing so much ofthe anglosaxon grammar as is needful to enable the reader to trace the origin of our inflexions and study our older writers with advantage this we think a valuable feature as also the chapter on etymology the hints on composition too with the quotations from standard authors for the purpose of illustration and the appendix of exercises and questions add much to the practical utility of the manual we have noticed one or two errors which may be corrected in subsequent editions the hackneyed quotation from shakspeare  who steals my purse steals trash is here printed he that steals c the difference is not material but in quotationsespecially in a work of this natureaccuracy is everything again by some slip of the pen we are told that the period extending from the restoration to the middle of the seventeenth century was the age of dryden pope addison and goldsmith  a handbook of the english language for the use of students of the universities and higher classes of schools by r glatham md i aylor  co the study of the english language has of late received more attention and been pursued in a more philosophical spirit than formerly englishmen are beginning to feel the inconsistency of knowing less about the theory of their own tongue than of that of any other the conviction is gaining ground that the english language if not so scientific as the greek or the german may be made almost as valuable a means of intellectual culture in the hands of a competent instructor to acquire a critical knowledge of english the several elements of which it is composed the relative proportions of each the changes that they have undergone and the way in which they were at first introduced and have since amalgamated together demands a good deal of patient investigation add to this a thorough comprehension and ready command of all the terms of the language and it will at once be evident that no englishman can be really master of his language without having gone through a course of study beneficial as a discipline of thc mind and  fraught with information which a due regard j to national feeling must make him anxious to  receive the deficiency of inflections the numerous anomalies and the other imperfections which may be considered drawbacks to our tongue as a means of education are more than counterbalanced by thc fact of its being our tongue and spreading over so vast a portion of the inhabited world no man has done more than dr latham to place the study of english on its proper footing by his philosophical treatment of it he lins raised it to the dignity which it deservesand shown that while an essential in the earliest education of children it is not unworthy to hold a high place in college pursuits his present work is a sort of medium between his large and school grammars it is rendered much more interesting as well as more useful to a student than the school grammar by containing not merely a greater number of facts but also a more copious discussion of principles nnd a fuller explanation of though origin and reasons of particular usages on though other hand it is less abstruse and more practical than the large work on the english

is handled in a most masterly manner all peculiarities of inflexion are carefully considered and if possible traced to their true origin or referred to some general law it is wonderful how few inexplicable anomalies are allowed to remain after dr latham has brought his powerful analysis to bear upon them by making free use of the anglosaxon and occasionally of other languages he gives the reader a thorough insight into all the varieties of inflexion and formation his account of the verb is highly instructive syntax and prosody are the topics discussed in the remainder of the work   the former naturally engrossing by far the greatest share of attention here too a truly philosophical spirit prevails in explaining rules of construction dr latham goes to the root of the matter and shows the dependence of the laws of language upon those of thought he decides in all disputed or doubtful cases by a reference to the idea intended to be conveyed rather than to the external form of the words used we give as an instance the following passage from the chapter on the  concord of verbs  in respect to the concord of person thc following rules will carry us through a portion of the difficulties  littlein sentences where there is but one proposition when a noun and a pronoun of different persons are in apposition the verb agrees with the first of themi your master command you not ctmmanils  your master i commands you not command  to understand the nature of the difficulty it is necessary to remember that subjects may be extremely complex as well as perfectly simple and that a complex subject may contain at one nnd the same time u noun substantive and a pronoun the keeper he the merchant c now all nounsubstantives are naturally of the third personjohn speaks the men run the commander gives orders consequently the verb is of the third person also but the pronoun with which such a nounsubstantive may be placed in apposition may be a pronoun of either person the first or second  i or thoui the commanderthou the commanderin this case the construction requires consideration with which does the verb agree with the substantive which requires a third person  or with the pronoun which requires a first or second  undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leading idea  and undoubtedly the idea which explains qualifies or defines it is the subordinate idea and undoubtedly it is the leading idea which determines thc construction of the verb we may illustrate this from the analogy of a similar construction in respect to numbera man with a horse and a gig meets me on the road here though ideas are three  nevertheless the verb is singular no addition of subordinate elements interferes with the construction that is determined by the leading idea in the expression i your master the ideas are two ti the idea expressed by 7 aud the idea ixprcsed by master neveithcless as the one only explains or defines th othu the corstnution is the sime is if the idea were hai your hiashr i is in the same condition the gmia statement is made concerning the matter and it is intended to say what he does the word  merely defines the expression by stating who the master is ofthe two expressions the latter is the awkwardest the construction however is the same for both from the analysis of the structure of complex subjects of the kind in question combined with a rule concerning the position of the subject which will soon be laid down i believe that for all single propositions the foregoing rule is absolute pulein all single propositions the verb agrees in person with the noun whether substantive or pronoun which conies first  but the expression it is i your master who command or commands you is not a single proposition it is a sentence containing two propositions 1 it is i 2 who command iou here the word master is so to say undistributed it may belong to either clause of the sentence ie the whole sentence may be divided into eitherit is i your master oryour master vho commands you this is the first point to observe the next is that the verb in the second clause command orcommands is governed not by either the personal pro noun or the substantive but by the relativeje in the particular case before us not by either or master but by who and this brings us to the following questionwith which ofthe two antecedents does the relative agree  with  or with master  this maybe answered by the two following rulespule 1when the two antecedents are in the same proposition though relative agrees with the first thus 1 it is  your master 2 who comma nd you pule 2when the two antecedents are in different propositions the relative agrees with the second thus 1 it u i 2 your matter who command you this however is not all what determines whether the two antecedents shall be in the same or in dif fcrent propositions i believe that the following rules for what may be called the distribution of the substantive antecedent will bear criticism  pule 1that when there is any natural connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the second clause thus in the expression just quoted the word master is logically connected with the word command nnd this fact makes the expression it is i your master who commands you the better of the two pule 2that when there is no natural connexion between the substantive antecedent nnd the verb governed by the relative the antecedent belongs to the first clause it is i john who command not commands you  to recapitulate the train of reasoning has been as follows1 the person of the second verb is the person of the relative 2 the person of the relative is that of one of two antecedents 3 of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the one which stands in the same proposition with itself 4 which position is determined by the connexion or want of connexion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative  respecting the person of thc verb in thers proposition of a complex sentence there is no doubt  your master who commands you to make haste am not is in a hurry here i am in a h wry is the first proposition who commands you to make haste the second it is not difficult to see why the construction of sentences consisting of two propositions is open to an amount of latitude which is not admissible in the construction of single propositions as long as the different parts of a complex idea are contained within the limits of a single proposition their subordinate character is easily discerned when however they amount to whole propositions they take the appearance of being independent members of the sentence with regard to the use of the subjunctive mood dr latham lays down the simple principle that whenever both conditionality and uncertainty are impliedno matter what conjunction or pronoun or other part of speech is employedthen and then only the verb must be in the subjunctive mood we have a little doubt as to the correctness of what follows whenever two or more pronouns of different persons and of the singular number follow each other disjunctively the question of concord arises  or youyou or hehe or i i believe that in these cases the rule isas follows1 whenever the words either or neither precede the pronouns the verb is in the third person either you or i is in the wrong neither you nor i is in the wrong 2 whenever the disjunctive is simple ie unaccompanied with the word either or neither the verb agrees with the first ofthe two pronouns  or he am in the wrong he or  it in the wrong thou or he art in the wrong lie or thou is in the wrong we need only say in conclusion that the english student is deeply indebted to dr latham for this valuable addition to his labours,ovel_contra

bellows lettres with them however miss braddon had nothing to do the critics raved but aurora floyd was in demand at the shops we are not in a position to state how many stories of our authoress were cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet novel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to express by the phrase quiet novel a work such as the vicar of wakeifiold oriiiri ciniawinnsthe trollope series of fictionsreaders of contemporary romances will have met with dozeus of quiet novels with dialogue as enlightened as the cackle of goese upon the green and a plot about as elaborate as the play of 1 puinch  when the manager is doubtful of timo feel to lbe tirrnaed himt for his trouble

they move rounl her skirts anl no doubt find it a more or n unprofitable calling to glean in the districts off which mi bradlon has reaped a crop it would occur to us id reading the novel now before us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the composition of her later wvares,ovel_contra

B2645,"['8535943', '6181610', '4453136', '4922775', '8765368']",  te literary exier the miu on ow floss by george eliot author ofi  scenes of clerical lifle and  adam bode in tlree volumes blackwood and sons it is worth while to inquire why one of the cleverest books of the day should be nearly the most tedious there is more evidence of the authors natural wit in the mill on the floes than there was in adam bede and a good natural wit is the first qualification of a storyteller it may be however that the cleverer book is at a disadvantage even in its cleverness ostendere not ostentare is an ancient warning the wit that shot up naturally in the former works of this writer and that was as pleasant in the  scenes from clerical life as in  adam bede having been lately shut up in a hothouse of too fervid praise is forced into excess of blossoming throughout the mill on the floss strain is evident it is an honourable strain to meet the utmost praise with the utmost deserving we know no example of a writer of genius forced into unnatural display of power who is more free than george eliot from all meanness of affectation overelaboration then may be one cause of the tediousness of the book charming sketches of childlife in former writings had received the commendation they deserved and so the first three hundred and sixty pages of the mill on the floss are spent on minute painting of a boy and girl the old praise is more than justified but the justification is attended by no small waste of the readers patience even as girl and boy maggie and tom weary us as they grow up they are made to weary us so much that by the time the story ends we are most grateful for the suddenness with whichwhen it is not to be supposed that one person remains who could bear to read about them any longerthey are both sent to the bottom of the floss the catastrophe though as a matter of art unsatisfactory precisely satisfies if we may generalise our own sense of relief the feeling of the reader let us say at once that we do not overlook the art with which by stray indications in the course of the book the end is foreshadowed that we duly appreciate the legend of ogg the son of beorl that we do know why maggie in her lovemaking is represented as having become clever at rowing and so forth we do not even complain of the suddenness and rapidity of the close although that may seem a fault by contrast with the long drag of the previous narrative we have no wish to urge the technical objection that the actual manner of the destruction of maggie and tom is impossible in nature obvious enough as the fact is that two floating bodies whatever their relative size being born on a current would be i born at the same rate so that the one floated in advance  if propelled even by the strength of a child must distance 1 the other the more serious fault of the catastrophe is part of the main fault of the book and we shall have to 1 discuss that presently it is the minor defect of excessive i elaboration that concerns us now i in no part of the work is this overelaboration so unsatis factory in its result as in the endeavour to maintain high credit for perception of the secret springs of character this credit we think was never fairly earned there is in the mil on the floes a very great profession of such insight for example when mr riley strongly recommends to mr tulliver the rev walter stelling as a tutor for his son tom having no very strong motives for doing so no less than five pages are occupied with a detailed analysis of the small reasons that may have worked together in his mind to affect the manner of that recommendation and all that is said in those five pages could have been better ex i pressed in a paragraph if not in one sentence it is indeed in this feature of the book only that there is room for the charge of a censurable affectation george eliot here appears as a quickwitted writer whose most laboured effort does not contain one possible character that is more than a sketchwho is clumsily wrong in every main feature of a story that is to be regarded as a copy from real life and who is cleverly wrong in a very great number of those ingenious remarks meant to express knowledge of life and character take for example the suggestion with regard to maggie of the  knowledge of the irreversible laws within and without her which governing the habits becomes morality and developing the feelings of submis son and dependence becomes religion the saying looks profound yet what could be more inadequate than to define religion the highest energy of life as a mere sbmision to irreversible laws surely such a writer if clever enough to be selfconscious can hardly claim to be considered an anatomist of human nature minute study of such artmanufacture as the dodsons might almost be compared to the deliberate handling of the scalpel over the ragcarcase of a fifth of november subject and tedious as the dodsons are how much exquisite humour has been pent on the elaboration of them  we only say that it is no anatomy of life at all it is a waste of lace and jewellery in the dressing up of scarecrows but thgeat saul at o r book a vw pet mwe at its td that w v ma have bow the intention of the writer it p en li s a n without a clue as r 1wa of amto iating great and shall ideas is rpoucd i a dilute form through half a dozen charaters for the of poorwitted provincial life is one of the plagues of the dodsons and beaks out even in bob jakin who is one of the least incomplete and impossible in th dory so the mechanic in another of mr dihkenss novels whose view of life was that  its aw a muddle has his axiom reproduced as if it were the one truth to be found by penetrating to the core of our humanity if the story of the mill on the floss has any central principle at all this passage from one of its clog chapts in which the italics are ours will express it the great problem of ihe bayinxg redit bdtwepenao axd duff is clear to no man who is capable of apprehedin it the question whether the moment has come in which a has lien below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy and must accept the sway of a passion against which he bad struggled as a trespass is one for which awves so matrboy tha4 wills all cam the casuists hase become a byword of reproach but their perverted spirit of minute discrimination as the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed the truth that moral judgments must remain false and hollow unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual lot to comment upon this passage is to comment on the tone of the whole book there is no  shifting relation between  passion and duty  whoever apprehends such a relation is below and not above the average of human wisdom in the words of one by whom we were taught the unity of truth and the simplicity of the divine law that can be applied as easily to conduct by the peasant as by the philosopher we have  a masterkey that will fit all cases it is not used to unlock the difficulties of life as they are untruly presented in this novel old tulliver dies worldly honest cherishing his hatred and his last words are said to be  this worlds  too many  honest man   puzzling    maggie the heroine for whose passionate life we are prepared from the beginning abandons a sentiment of love slow and long in its growth for a sudden passion of mere lust towards a man who displays only coarse animal love for herself and this under surrounding circumstances that are designed to aggravate the shame the author does not seem to perceive how despicable the heroine at last becomes and how little sympathy is to be won for her tortures and her doubts for her conflict of duty with passion that did once in the course of her life acquire the help of some ascetic teaching from thomas a rempis but that never attained to the application of the first principles of christian life which are the common ground possessed alike bay christian of every name a knot is tied by lustunless it be his account of the contents of bucklands  bridgewater treatise there is nothing else to account for maggies sudden love of stephenand the only solution of the difficulty is such shallow comment as the sentence we have quoted illustrates followed immediately by a letting loose of the floodgates to drown with maggie and tom all further consideration of the puzzle as it is with the book as a whole so it is with the characters presented in it the bible appears once or twice in the story as a thing to lay a hand upon and curse by there is one reverent allusion to the christian doctrine of tolerance in association with the doctrine of the story that provincial life is utterly intolerant as a social picture the tale may have been meant indeed to display the narrowness of life in country places but here also it is not true the scandal of a little town it needs no penetration to remark upon true depth of penetration would rather have been shown in pointing out how the warm human heart beats even in country towns as in the capital how mere an accident though a too obvious accident is that restriction and localization of talk which is here represented as the core of human life a narrow ugly grovelling existence among the people of st oggs truer and cleverer than this novel even as a picture of the outside littlenesses of provincial society infinitely truer in its recognition of the minds to which they are but as a dress was mrs giskells  cranford the merit of the mill on the floss as of george eliots former books lies mainly in shred feminine humour and a quick perception not of the depths and mysteries of life but of what is quaint and noteworthy in its externals to these qualities value is usually given by a wholesome unaffected style that will express truthfully the lights and shadows of the writers feeling an occasional defect in the style we are tempted to attribute to interpolation in speaking of adam bede we hinted a suspicion that it contained touches by a male as well as by a female hand we cannot easily believe that it is the graceful writer of the main part of the mdiu on the flos who describes young philip at the piano as an  amorphous bundle who speaks with cumbrous jest of a servantmaid scrubbing a table as  suffering a waste of tissue by evaporation compares  a shiny deposit of dust  on clothes to  tablets prepared for writing upon  speaks of wakems  parenthetic vindictiveness towards the uncomplimentary 1miller and of mr tullivers faculties  renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstra tion of the senses  ends a chapter with a similitude about the  nidus of seeds with  an apparatus of  hooks  to get hold of very unreceptive surfaces avoids naming rabbits humorously but unnecessarily by calling them  the more familiar rodents with more of the same sort of dulness if it be not that another hand is answerable for passages amd phases em ad ee part of capte in the book that are as cape in dsey vatican wie mixed with

as we prefer to suppose a itu let it be remembered that suc spoiling of a good thing is worse than injudicious clue as juguar faenwmr we have been slow to direct attention to the faults ol the miuo the foam  and having done so we can only part fom the author with a cordial recognition of her gsius and with the confession of a belief that among the emal novelista of our day only min bronte and mrs skell occupy a higher place than she is likely to retain we shall be as quick to praise her next work as we have been slow to censure this if she do not again weary us by presenting to the world artificial men and womenas disjointed pieces of a puzzle to be wrongly put together and then swept off in despair  he mill on the floss novels and romances by george elliot blackwoodsthe authoress of  adam bede has been aptly compared to a dutch painter her writings belong essentially to the minute and truthful school of art and very often do not escape the accompanying drawback that for the sake of minuteness and truth grace refinement and even dramatic effect are ruthlessly sacrificed the result is that the characters painted with such wonderful accuracy are disgustingly coarse and what is worse in an artistic scene the incidents described with so much painstaking veresimilitude are trivial and uninteresting to a lamentable degree this fault dimly perceptible even in  adam bede has become unpleasantly conspicuous in the mill on the floss the characters are drawn with the microscopic accuracy of a photograph but when we have got them there is nothing either in themselves or in what they do which can excite any serious sympathy in their peculiar traits and personal fortunes the scene of the story is laid in the vicinity of some tenth rate town of semiagricultural semicommercial character through which passes the flosswhich the reader discovers somewhat to his surprise to be a tidal river rather prone to inundation all the personages of the tale belong to the lower station of the middle or the upper station of the lower class they are millers small farmers or engaged in retail business the constituents in short of that numerous section of the industrious community among whom fifty years since a sort of rugged honesty constituted the chief virtue but whose coarse grain has by the recent spread of education become overlaid with a thin veneer of refinement to this class the tulliver and dodson families who supply nearly the whole series of dramatis persona to the novel intrinsically belong the peer tulliver is the centre figure of the book and his wife whose constant boast it is to  have been a dodson brings the story into contact with numerous scions of that strongly marked but highly commonplace family the tullivers at the outset own the  mill on the floss and are well to do in the world but during the course of the tale lose their property and sink into sad destitution through the too eager prosecution of a lawsuit by mr tulliver the worthy pair have two children tom and maggie the former inheriting the practical tastes and also the obstinacy of his father the latter acquiring no one can tell how but certainly from no family source a truthful and somewhat romantic disposition accompanied by that  strong necessity for loving  which is the cause of so much happiness or misery as the case may be in actual life and constitutes one of the chief desiderata in the heroine of a novel through the first volume we have described the development of these characters in the boyandgirl stages described with wonderful truthfulness and rendered highly entertaining there is also a good deal about various members of the dodson family and the authoress shows her miraculous talent of eharacterpainting by the perfection in which individuality is stamped and preserved upon each of a rather numerous group although not one of them rise above the level of the most ordinary commonplace or possesses any more distinctive characteristics than those arising from the exhibition of small vanities and petty jealousies and microscopical grievances towards other scions of the dodson stock at the end of the volume a lawsuit  which has for years been the nightmare of the tulliver existence ends in an adverse verdict old tulliver is now ruined and sold up the mill on the floss passes to other owners its new proprietor being lawyer wakem his opponent at the trial and whom mr tulliver regards professionally and personally as an agent of the evil one and declared enemy not only of himself specially but of mankind in general the series of motives which induce the obstinate old man to remain as manager in the mill that once was his own is traced with admirable art and a true insight into the depths of the human mind is evinced when he is made to swear in the same breath and write on the flyleaf of his family bible his determination to serve his old enemy honestly and yet hate him eternally this vicissitude of fortune produces its natural effect upon the character and the career of tom and maggie but the story henceforth becomes highly distressing and we will not carry our analysis any further suffice it to say that while tom achieves some practical successes maggie gets into various difficulties and entanglements she turns ascetic under the erroneous impression that voluntary suffering is the source of happiness falls in love with the intellectual qualities of philip wakem the deformed son of their lawyer enemy and of old toms schoolfellow and with the personal qualities of stephen guest the son of an enriched manufacturer with whom the dodson family are somehow connected in vacillating between these rivals maggie contrives to bring misery upon both and involves in the misfortune her own cousin and friend lucy who has been almost engaged to stephen in the third volume a new set of characters are introduced the small gentry of the cathedral town of st oggs but by this time space has become valuable and it is necessary to hurry forward the incidents which led up to the final catastrophe this is brought about by a heavy flood on the flossthis river from the beginning being described as disagreeably prone to inundationin which maggie and tom are swept away together the conclusion is essentially melodramatic and so also is most of the  business to use a stage term by which it is introduced on the whole we are obliged to say that the authoress of  adam bede  has in her present novel not made a step in advance admirable in parts the  mill on the floss  is a failure on the whole in comparing the book before us with its predecessor we subject it no doubt to a severe test the sweepings and afterthoughts of a work like  adam bede might furnish forth more than one novel which mudie would patronize the public read and the oritics approve if written by any other author the gleaning of the grapes in ephraim may be better than the vintage of abiezer but the superiority

arid a daughter maggie the latter is the heroine of the story and a most interesting character there ar several other persons but the main interest is concentrated in these mr tullivers views with respect to his son are thus graphically giaen what i want is to give tom a good eddication sell be bread to him that was what i was thinking of when i gave notice for him to leave th academy at ladyday i mean to put him to a downright good school at midsummer the two years at th academy od ha done well enough if id meant to make a miller and a farrier of him for hes had a fine tight more schooling nor ever i got all the leanin my father ever paid for was a bit o birch at one end and the alphabet at th other but i should like tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the

same ambitious view s as hcr husband for the boy she thinks more of the commissariat part of the establishment and has her doubts about  the washing and mending a iis clothes these indistinct doubts lead to tie suggestion on her part of all educational prgceedings being being restricted to the limits of the carriers cart mrs tullwer is in excellent sort of person but not uncomfortably troubled with intellect or intellectual aspirations but although her character on the whole is natural perhaps she is at times nade very absurd by having absurdities put into her mouth and here we would illustrating the remark by a specimen of the ladys conversation notice one very great defect in this writers dialogue for the sake of effect isle makes her characters say things they never would  syutter nonsense in fact which is meant to pas for fun ihe following has nothing droll in ir but is simply ridiculous she says after discussing the interesting matter of airing sheets well sir

puts words into her mouth for the express purpose of being lahed at the pupose is transparent other authors d e e t do the same the poor people of 8ir walters novels are true to nature they ar not mad as surd the droll is a very different style only at taimed perhaps by dickens or anthony trollope now adays these are supremely droll in their lighter passages when writers of an inferior calibre try to be droll they become either noensical or vulgar but in contradistinction to the above solfioqy on the sheets we subjoin the following good description of the child maggie  you talk o cuteness mr tulliver sbe obervedl as she sat down 1but im sure the childs half an idiot in some things for if i send her uwtair to fetch anything she forgets what shes gone for a erhaps ull sit down on the foor

along the banks of the millstream studying nattare and the other half in an old attic studyingr her books to which we shall refer present lv and also in another ocpation also for future consideration mrs tulliver is in despair about maggie she prophecies that she well never come to any good but will meet with some unexpected disaster in the way of drowning or other catastrophe she tried to impress maggie with a sense of her own unworthiress and advccates patchwork as a fitting means of useful occupation on one occasion when maggie has as usual been wvaiileiing on the banks of the millstream and has returned in a hopeless state of desbabille her mother delivers the foliowing admonitory letum  0 dear 0 dear maggie says krs tulliver  what are you thinking of to throw your botsnet down there take it upstairs theres a good gal an let your hair be brushed an put your other pinafore on an go on with your patchwork like a lady maggies answer is philosophical its foolish work sid maggie with a

being one of the collection and a very great fah vorite moreover she had banyans pilgrims progress too but she liked tk pictesbier than the lettepress of this latter work as to the letti r s its chief recommendation seems to have been that tberes a deal about the devil in it this uuamiable personage and maggie is a firm believer in his personality is her favourite study ill show you a picture of him blie says to mr riley one of her fathers friends ill show you the picture of him in his true shape as he appeared to christianthe body all black you knowtom bad coloured it in his holidaysand the eyes red like fire because hes all fire inside and it shines out at his eyes the philosophy of this writer has been highly and deservedly eulogisedi but she is not invariably correct the following is

preceding novel is yet so lik it general tone of thouglt and in the picturs life which it represents that cornasw a fair tureen the two books becomes in this means of criticism in the mill on the floss then we have a more complex book than  adam bede there are many more personages each of them individualised without exaggeration there are crosspurposes and conflicting motives and passions to a far greater degree than in the other simple drama the time through which the chronicles extend is longer the chief actors are presented to us not fully formed but as children whose temperaments we are to see modified by circumstances whose characters wve are to see gradually unfolded and perfected much more artistic labour has been bestowed on this book than on adam bede the workingout of maggie from the child hungty for love to the woman who triumphs in her selfrenunciation at the most difficult moment was surely a greater mental toil than the conception of lietty with her immobile animal nature and her unchangeable selfishlness he four dodsonsisters each distinct all unmistakably of the 1odson family were surely not so easily conceived and sustained as the one mrs poyser we tind snore artistic labouir here and unfailing success but on the other hand we feel that with all this greater comparative cleverness the hook does not enthral us as  adam bede lid he seal of omnipotent genius though present and to le found 1y those who seek for it does not manifest itself to readers of all kinds and classes so readily compelling instant acknowledgment and homage maggie notwithstandirig her lifelike development from child to womnau and the varying lights of passion and of ill under which she is exhibited to us never gains that objective existence which letty possessednever quite frees

dispositions of the two children are very different tom is mnatteroffact full of commonsense anld quliet determination he has a strong and clear apprehension of justice but the to dicnion with him as with so many people is simply what he sees to be just and right as regarls the conduct of others lie constitutes himself the judge and suffers tio appeal against his judgment conscious of his own strong will and rectitude of purpose he has no suspicion that he is incapable of fathoming the tendencies and motives of others and of weighing their actions in impartial scales he takes his place as judge by right he never doubts his prerogative he never site in judgement on himself or balances the shortcomings of others against shortcomings of his own within the narrow range of his circle of sight he sees very acutely and distinctly and performs the duties which lie manifestly therein with a power and virtue that cannot be surpassed but he brings all with whom he has to deal within these narrow limits and arraigns them there being unable to conceive of any regions beyond maggie on the contrary has the wide vision which finds itself bounded only by those clouds of mystery that hang about the horizon of this mortal life she is always reaching out towards that far distance for something better and greater and more true than she can grasp in the actualities immediately around her she craves with an unsatisfied hunger for appreciation for admiration for love she searches vainly in the hearts of her kindred for exquisite sympathies which have no place there she feels herself imprisoned and fettered by the sordid circumstances which encompass her ann longs for unattainable delights of beautiful sounds and sights and thoughts she has none of oms clear logical perception of near things in her interpretation of them she is alnost always wrong she is al most alwvays doing rvhat she should not and discovering her error when it is too late and repenting with bitterest imagining of what might have been and what will be she is dreaming when she should be acting she forgets to feed toms rabbits and lets them starve to death while for every insect that she neets she invents some story investing it with human feelings and attributes facts are less real to her than her own fancies a quaint picture or a fragment of a book such as the examples in the latin grammar suggests more to her than the everyday sights and incidents of common existence he misfortunes of the family which introduce om to that life of strenuous exertion for which lie is especially fitted by nature sadden the position of poor maggie yet more her hopes her intense longings for ap preciation and for outward enjoyments congruous with her keen sense of beauty die away after much miserable wrestling with her fate she arrives at that stage of selfrenunciation where starved natures so often find a refuge then philip wakem reappears upon the scene and maggie is roused from her torpor to enjoy some months of happiness ending in worse misery poor maggie is never in conformity with the circumstances in which she is placed that which should be the longwishedfor blesssing always turns out the direst curse she has not that happy limitation of perception that tom has and is continually directing her conduct according to the feelings and the will of others her father and brother hate philip wakem and philip wakem loves her while still further complexity she does not love philip wakem then again in the case of stephen guest the conflicting interests are yet more irreconcilable her fate is always at war with maggie tulliver out of her trials and weaknesses however she gathers a majesty of strength in comparison with which toms sober rectitude sinks into insignificance her sense of justice unfolds itself into the very opposite of that which rules her brother seeking its sanctions not in herself but in those for whom she has to renounce herself   e  in the contrast of the characters of this brother and sister consists the main idea of the book that both are admirably conceived and consummated no one will deny tom is the more artistic creation though he is much less interesting than maggie in any other hands but in those of george eliot tom would have be come a cruel selfish monster or a man of highest wisdom no author is so impartial as george eliot he plants the failings and the virtues of his characters with equal freedom from prejudice with equal tenderness he never contrasts the good qualities of a person with the bad for the purpose of antithetical etlect but makes good and bad run into each other and intermix as a watercolour artist blends his colours on the paper there are no rigid outlines in nature no harsh crude oppositions of light and dark or of primaries and their complemnentaries but infinite gradations of shade and harmonies of colour this george eliot sees in its full significance he never forgets that vices are but virtues in excess or defect and that the extremes while they are negations of each other are nevertheless connected by an indivisible bond he never forgets that practically these absolute extremes are to be found nowhere in human nature any more than the absolute mean of which if we were capable we should cease to be men and should become divine    this tom tulliver is e to use a bad word the most objective character in the  mill on the floss thus coming iato comparison with the hetty of adam bede the hard narrowness of torn is as foreign to the temperament of the author ab hettys animalism if we begin to surmise how such characters are conceived we find the process to be one of denudation ihe creator of jetty has to throw aside the inoral and intellectual parts of his nature the creator of tom has to limit his sympathies within a prescribed circle of narrowest radius this denudation is a very different matter to that imaginative process which ordinary novelists use when they raise their personages from wonted middleclass life to the peerage or push back their smiths and joneses of today into the middleages the danger in drawing such i characters as rom and hetty is always lest thel denudation should be carried too far hettys might easily have become wholly ppetitive ad i thus have lost her humanity tom might easily have become a monster having no sympathies t whatever     in magie it seems to i us that we can trace a strong resemblance to i the janet of janets repentance if we a were sure that george eliots characters bad f their germ in reality as we firmly be i lieve

eliots power and contrasts marvellously with the dutch painting of the dodson class great care is taken to keep stephen guest out of the category of villainous tempters and seducers he is lamentably weak but not wicked aforethought the crisis of his running away with maggie arises from accidental farourablenes of circumstances not from design on his part or agreement on here there are no villains in these books of george lfliots we find in them no unpardonable sinners whom poetic justice dooms to an ill ending     the last scene in which tom and maggie after long estrangement meet upon the swollen river and die together fidy gives a sad ending to this sad story  j a  the mill on the floss by george eliot 3 vols blackwood  sons  the mill on thc floss will not we think obtain tne same acceptance as adam bede it is not that there are traces of exhaustion but the present work bears tokens of haste it lacks the fullness of a work written in calm leisure the echo of the old success has not had time to subside and the authoress seems to have been haunted by a spirit of emulation with her own shadowthe everpresent obligation of being equal to herself there is a pervading sense of hurried unrest and of ambitious striving to write not out of the heart but with a desire to reproduce the effect of mrs poysers sententious sayings and lisbeth bedes querulous maunderings the characters of the four sisters who had all been  dobsons and had a  way in their family are cleverly drawn but they verge on caricature and there is a great deal too much about them they are like favourite actors presuming on old favour to make their jokes and byplay too prominent the authoress shows skill in the way in which lier characters are made to reveal themselves by their own words and acts without any formal description beyond a few decisive and masterly touches there is power to unravel the contradictions of human feeling and insight into the tangled complications of human relationships and eloquence to utter what the heart has been subtle to conceive  but with all this and in spite of occasional vigorous scenes and delineations the sense of haste and unrest gives a coldness and crudeness which make the work like fine fruit plucked before it is ripe the heroine maggie is the best drawn character in the book it is subtly conceived and it is original worked out by the authoress with a skilful and loving hand tom trulliver her brother is an excel lent companion picture and thc two natures are well contrasted maggie is however though most elaborately worked out her imaginative passionate nature with its desires to do right and its touching failuresthe resolute heart the imperfect judgment  though treacherous sliding imaginative affectionsthe battle of life begun and carried on in thc vain trust in her own unassisted strengththe weariness with the greatness of the way which overwhelms her and her utter weakness against the illicit affection that creeps into her heart making her guilty of the cruellest wrong and treachery to her dearest friendthe misery brought on all connected with herthe feeble but constant struggle of her better natuic against the magnetic insidious influence of passionthe final blind desperate effort with which she breaks away and returns broken iu heart tarnished in good fame with the certainty of having made though irrevocable misery of all she loved bestwith her own misery greater than she could bear and a desolate life beforenothing saved from the wreck of her young life except the consciousness that she broke loose from her temptation and at the eleventh hour escaped back into the right way this is all worked out with a power and pathos that is very beautiful the love described is not of a nigh nature stephen guest whom she attracts from her cousin is a commonplace handsome young man  he yields to the attraction of a remarkablelooking young woman with scarcely a struggle the reader is bidden to accept it as a case of elective affinity  it is mere personal attraction a passionate inclination which swallows up honour duty humanity ties of kindred and friendship it is the essence of selfishness but the struggle is not the less fierce in maggie because it is ignoble nor is the temptation less because rt is base  and whatever the readers indignation may be or hissympathy with lucy the sweet generous forsaken maiden or with phillip the betrothed husband and devoted friend of maggie the whole episode is so skilfully wrought that all his other feelings will be merged in though milder grief of pity the history of mr trulliver and his sorrows and difficulties have an interest of their own and mrs trulliver his wife is another version of mrs nitkleby we have abstained from giving any outline of the story of the mill on the floss because we did not wish to forestall the readers interest and a mere outline would hardly give a fair notion of it if wc seem severe in our judgment it is

B7144,['9431502'],  themie keller by the author of  george geith c 3 vols tinsley brothers  phemie keller has many of the excellencies that mark the author of george geith but it is weakened by a strain of sentimentality which mars the readers enjoyment and subtracts from the value of the lesson which it is intended to inculcate the introduction is charming phemie keller a beautiful young girl brought up amongst the cumberland hills sitting in the parish church of tordale and singing with her glorious voice the old psalms and hymns is a clear and welldrawn picture which the reader will carry through with him to the end of the book the interest once created is never lost capt stondon the lonely man returned from india and seeing her for the first time and feeling the old faculty of loving truly reawakened in his heart at the sight of her his accident among the hills his confinement at the farmhouse where she lives the curious household made up of such anomalous elements yet combined in spite of the scolding woman at the head of it by the broad and gentle love of the master are true and fresh aggland the uncle of phemie is excellently drawn  and the little sketch of his previous life is very interesting his quotations too are all apt and fresh and the reader will be glad to know them all this portion of the work could scarcely be better but when the writer begins to sigh and forecast coming trouble in ominous words and dark hints the book grows tiresome and irritating when the author treats the love of a good man like capt stondon as a species of misfortune for phemiewho though born of good family is dependent on the kindness of her mothers humble kindred and has a very hard drudging life of it with no opportunities for education or pleasure and when her idle girlish reveries about love and marriage the lover to be some handsome young man who is to take her away in a grand carriage and clothe her in silks and jewels is seriously treated by the author as a revelation of a better destiny for which it behoved phemie to waitthe wail sent up after the fading vision is utterly foolish phemie is represented as crying her eyes out when capt stondon asks her to marry him we are told he is considerably her elder that he is year for year quite as old as her uncle but we are also assured that he is a fine manlylooking noble gentleman and these vague unformed fancies containing as much vanity as presentiment are set up as serious obstacles which ought to have prevented the marriage it was says the author a closing up of the possibilities of her lifea pledging away all the long long years she had in all probability before her that she could never now become sinlessly acquainted with love  that she was resigning all chance of happy love love with its bliss and agony love witn its doubts and distractions love without which no life be it ever so symmetrical can be perfect this is the keynote of the book and it is not handled in a masterly manner the author being pledged to make phemie repent of course carries it out though what prospect a girl in her position had of seeing anybody worth this  love  is not shown they are all vulgar coarse persons the young men who come in her way and the love of a young girl seldom lasts all her life for the same person she marries capt stondon and onehalf of her dreams are realized she has more than all the fine clothes she longed for and her husband makes her love him thoroughly and happily if the author did not persist in picking her lot to pieces sighing here hinting there and lamenting the prosperity of her life phemie keller and her husband might have lived as happily as true lovers in a storybook the mistake the author makes is to treat with reverence as a solemn gift of the power to love that which in reality was nothing in the world but the power of idleness developed in the petted young wife and a very handsome selfish weak senti mental young manwho had no pith of character in him no sense of honour or energy but who drifted into temptation and stayed in it beca he liked it given the circumstances if phenus had married an angel she would have gos just as eagerly after forbidden excitement and romance her heart however never really swerves from its allegiance she loses her heul and her vanity is highly gratified vanity ana selflove are the only qualities brought intoplay by this great passion when she finds that basil has loved other women before hepself she is angry when she finds in after years that he could not remain constant bit married as soon as he had the chance she is disgusted and degrades her idol the scene where phemie is a widow and basil comes back as from the grave bringing a wife and a child with him is very good but all the remorse am the misery are overstrained and exaggerated not a reader who takes up  phemie keller  but could if so minded tell a tale of sorrow suffering and wild emotion but people have to live through those things and the mistake in  phemie keller is that the author makes too much of emotions that come and go and pass away phemies remorse for her disloyalty to her husband is not healthy and the miserable death of miss dermo just when her long constancy was rewarded is a piece of unnecessary illnature on the part of the author altogether phemie keller has a depressing and not a strengthening influence on the reader,ovel_contra

only swinburne and swinburne owed his first start in public estimation with re vereuee i say it not so much to his great and noble qualities as to his youthful audacity the men of the forties and fifties had for the most part to throw away on journalism faculties far superior to the production of those ballades in blue china and those proverbs in porcelain for which alone they could gain a hearing aad if in the end like thomas hardy they obtained at last by some work of genius some tess of the durbervilles an adequate recognition they obtained it only after long waiting and watching too late for it to produce that ebullition of youthful uro so beneficial to byron to dickens to swinburne hope deferred made their hearts sick with the grey sickness of pessimism and pessimism is the

generous appreciation there is no knowing what tragedies and comedies we of the middle kingdom might have produced if only we had had a little of that genial incense let us take good care that the

everything he says bears in matter and form alike the distinct impress of his exceptional idiosyncrasy you may love it or you may hate it but there it isthe man himself his voice his tone his accent indeed this very pervasiveness of the individuality is the true mark of seership the personal equation counts for much our singer sees the outer world through the refractive medium of a poets soul and what he sees he says in the very way he sees it not only so but in these prose fancies as before in the bookbills of narcissus wo get a distinct element of personal and frankly autobiographical touches with many other men such touches would be sheer egotism with le gailienne they are etherialised and purged from that offence by i know not what strange undercurrent of impersonal personality and broad human portraiture he interests himself and he interests us rather as a specimen than as an ego rather as a unit of humanity than as the gentleman who lives in such a house in blank street it is our common nature speaking out in him that engages us but our common nature euvisaged through the optic lens of the poet and the artist thus the exquisite little idyll of  a borrowed sovereign is as frankly personal as anything in rousseaus confessions and a vast deal truer there is absolutely no tinge of concealment about it all is plain and straight as the thames embankment jim lent me a sovereign it begins and you have never a doubt as to jims realityhe is just jimor as to the historical character of the financial transaction thus innocently forced upon you indeed the very names of the two persons who form the dramatis personae of the pathetic wee idyll are ingenuously inscribed upon it what then so redeem it from any tinge of egotism why its utter want of false shame of essential selfconsciousness the prose poet poses himself as one of mankind and tells with an exquisite artlessness which is the finest flower of art a typical little tale of a minor act of selfishness and a minor repentance the whole thing is but a passing episode in three young peoples liveswe might all of us have lived itbut through it there runs like a crimson thread the sweet story of a girls love and a brothers sympathy the figures are by mere accident an i and a you in their inner nature they are a man and a maid a lover and his lass and a brother and sister the bookbills gave us a glimpse of a new master of style english poems to my mind did not quito redeem that promise i may bo wrong i may have pitched my expectations too high but in spite of souio exquisite little piocos of lyric verse i still think le gailienne up to dato has done best as a prose poet his lawlessness in rhyme and metre contrast somewhat curiously with the delicate perfection of his workmanship in his best prose writing but then i will allow that i am probably prejudiced in this matter by the long habit of teaching and writing greek and latin versewhich pleasing task occupied some six years of an otherwise wellspent life with the solemnities of senarii or the frivolities of elegiacs and i cannot entirely get over my feeling that poetry ought to be accurately divisible into fines and feet of so many dactyls and spondees hence formally perfect metrification like swinburnes and watsons appeals to me powerfully from the point of view of execution while i find it hard at times to reconcile my ear to the native linnet music of le gailienne or the irregular mocking bird note of john davidson however thu may be and i apologise for such strictly personal intrusion of my own tastes and predilections i feel sure that prose fancies is a work of the highest artistic value it shows a great advance on the bookbills which were hitherto the highwater mark of le galliennes performance especially in the direction of the management of the individual sentence and the constant bright play of wit and fancy here each clause tells a lustre as of sh t silk like the magdalens dress in ihe mantegna at the national gallery gleams perpetually through the woof of grave thought or high sentiment a nonconformist sterne a puritan jeanjacques our poet weaves over the strands of his ascetic creed though gold thread of a playful and fantastic humour not that even the asceticism must be taken too seriously as one sees it taken by the admiring wesleyan preacher lo galliennes is one of thoso poetic natures in which a high and almost ecstatic morality of sentiment is wholly divorced from the vulgar routine of practice ho sings of tavern nights with the voice of an angel he prophecies 4 woe woe over his oysters and porter  what a beaconlight of repentance   cries the enchanted pastor  i do love champagne and rumpsteak says the poet almost all the papers in this little volume are good like the undergraduate who was asked to name the minor prophets i decline therefore to make invidious distinctions but if i were driven to make a selection i should say my favourites are a spring morning life in inverted commas  the womans halfprofits and  the blessedness of woman au these are instinct with a certain delicate and elusive aroma of humour a bouquet as of the lightest and finest johannisberg but by far the most beautiful and touching poem among all these gems of lyric thought is the last in the volumethe sad note which closes a delicious diapason of poetic fancy it is called white soul and it fitly enshrines the memory of a pure and lovely life about which i dare hardly allow myself though luxury of speech everyone knows that tragedy what all do not know is the gentle and shrinking nature of the woman to whom her husband unconsciously dedicated by anticipation this sweet and strangely prophetic elegy i will not attempt to describe either it or her the poet himself has painted that shy naturehalf elfish half gipsylike with a touch of genius and a touch of second sightin one of the daintiest and truest fantasies in the english language i refrain from saying more those who read the book itself will understand why it is not so much a theme for criticism as for sympathetic silence grant allen  prose fancies prose fancies by richard li galiilnnl london mathews mr lc galliennes prose fancies is a singular rhapsody in prose fanciful and prosy as it is from end to end the writer is critical moralising satirical poetical pathetic sceptical sympathetic and cynicalin a word he is as it has been said  ali things by turns but nothing long verily to wade through these weary essays is a lesson in patience happily relieved by their brevity whether we look at the quality of their matter or their style with one exception wc are fairly puzzled to understanel what moved the author to write them and to publish them  for instruction or information of any value

very safe conscience witheut any breach of the divine command against idolatry unlike as it is to anything in heaven above in the earth beneath or the waters under the earth it is a thousand pities mr le gallienne did not stick to his poetry for to his credit it may bc saidand we really like to have something to say in his favourhe has written some excellent poetry and we can only account for the publication of this very silly work on the authors own jirinciples when in one of his essays he asks with truth  is it not e urious that the very follies we delight in for ourselves should seem so stupid so absolutely vulgar when practised by others  the last illusion to forsake a man is the absolute belief in his own refinement mr le gallienne himself is a singular exemplification of the wellknown truism here enunciated so much for the general character of the work and now let us look at some of its particulars in several of the essays the author seems to fall into a reverie or dream in which some beautiful girl or angelic being appears to him in one case it is  one of those discarded muses who sometimes remain upon the poets hands as fates and gentle reader can you conjecture the mission of this visitant it was to demand  halfprofits from the poet on the ground that it was she who had inspired him here is a specimen of this visionary visit as well as a fair sample of the

include himself anel his jmblisher in the sweejiing assertion that a  poet is a fool anel a publisher a knave if he does we must admire his straightforwarelness in another vision our author is favoured with the visitation of  a young girl in a dainty gown with a sweet blonde face but more character in it than usually falls to the lot of thc english girl now most admirers of beauty in women have seen more character in english girls than is to be seen elsewhere but as this writer says in his essay on the eye of a beholder  all of course depends on the eye of the beholder and we may add on his predilection to our mind however the most serious charge to be brought against this work is the tone of levity and irreverence to say the least in which the writer touches on the most sacred of subjects and the most cherished beliefs it is eejually silly and irreverent for examjde to write of the dead having long since given up all hoes ot the resurrection and to babble about the  angel gabriel himself dreading a bluestocking another striking feature of thc work is not merely the motley unconnected character of the subjects treated following one afier another without a single thread of interconnection but the sudden and rajid transition with which when writing on the same subjects the writer rounds from one phase of it to another reminding one of thc circusriders bounds from one horse to another at running sjeed his literary criticisms are ejuite on a par with his other idiosyncrasies he coolly puts a veto on the accepted adage of wordsworth the child is the father of the man this he denounces as  a merely verbal paradox which shows the poets ignorance of humanity of st valentine he asserts that  tradition has but two pieces of information about himnamely that he was beaten with heavy clods and then beheaded and likewise he was a man of exceptional chastity of character ste  if our author will only consult baring huilds llics ot thc saints and the western martyrologies he will find a few additional pieces of information of which he is clearly ignorant again fame we are informed  in athens anel florence took the form of a laurel here for athens our author should read rome for in athens  fame took thc form of the olive wreath not of the laurel verily it is dangerous to flourish a little knowledge may we remind him too that dr watts did not write a book entitled thc human mind but one entitled the improvement of the minda work by the way which contains some admirable rules for attaining the art of writing with simplicity in which our author is by no means proficient although he pro fesses to have an ardent admiration for  simplicity and seems to long for its return to the world it has left we trust he is sincere in the jrofession though it is sadly compromised by his own habit of writing in a style which is anything but simjde and intelligible one is puzzled to understanel what mr ia gallienne for examjde means by  the colossal absorjtion ed balzac by  the laughter of an organ  the laughter of a nightingale by endless ore hidaceous variatiem and by such sentences as  the birth of a child is truly a mysterious traffic between the divine powers of nature anel her miraculous wont mystic visitations of radiant faces hidden eternally from the knowledge of man to do mr lc iallienne however justice we freely admit that he has written one sensible essay notw ithstanding a few elrawbacksnamely anarchy in a library in which he successfully exjoses the fallacies of the so idistie theory of eejuality he is correct too in

B5870,"['6740474', '3178519']",  fancy farm by neil munro blackwood and sons 6s i sot the first fewv chapters of this book we retained our hope that in spite of an unpromising beginning it would presently prove to possess something of that humorous charm that pleased us in daft days then we realised our mistake and set ourselves manfully to accomplish our tedious task of reading it through there is a captain cutlass in it a person of shadowy eccentricities there is a girl called penelope an illbred prig who seems to have read bernard shaw without understanding there is also another girl called norahlshe is the one tolerable character in the book there is too a poet another of those novelistpoets of whom we are utterly weary there is a storm and a broken ankle and a conflagration in the heroines bedroom the volume is we believe what is known as a  pawky book it is also a very foolish book quite unworthy of its author mr j m barrie is responsible for a good deal of really bad fiction as in the case of dickens his imitators appear to find it easier to imitate his faults than to reproduce his merits we hope that after this air neil munro will return to his earlier manner  fancy farm nobody could accuse mr munro of being unduly ccnceited when he declares at the very outset of this novel that he is going to record the diverting experiment cf sir andrew schaw to train the ideal wife in evern way he is as good as his word sir andrew himselfor captain cutlass as he is familiarly termedis a most whimsical character who combines in a bewildering fashion the mcst unpractical and at the same time the soundest commonsense notions in accordance with which he acts just as the fancy takes him we get a pretty shrewd notion of what we are to expect when we find that sir andrew who is now a widower married his first wife under a complete misunderstanding having proposed by telegraph to one of two sisters while he was under the delusion that he was courting the other undaunted by this mishap sir andrew announces his desire for a second wife and his recently emancipated ward norah immediately and in secret takes steps to provide him with the required article by inviting to the house a schoolfriend of her own complications promptly ensue sir andrew beaten in a curling match by the postboy undertakes to assume his duties for one night and in that capacity drives to his own house not the young lady who is destined for him but her companion penelope colquhoun the situation thus briefly outlined lends itself of course to vast possibilities sir andrew as may be guessed becomes deeply interested in his  fare persuades her to remain as companion to norah and endeavours to mould her as far as possible into a likeness to that young lady the whole neighbourhood naturally concludes that penelope is to marry the baronet with the single exception of one miss birrell  stop you   she says  stop you  and sir andrew will surprise you   fancy farm by neil munro 6s blackwood a fairly safe pronouncement considering sir andrews character and one not unworthy of the delphic oracle as it turns out miss birrell is right and everxbodv else is wrong penelope learns by chance what is being said by the neighbours and she promptly revolts against the notion that she is being moulded to a pattern even though it may be elegant and pleasing to her friends she sickens at the thought that all her recently acquired accomplishments such as riding lancing fencing the cultivation of a more subdued deportment and tone of voice have been forced upon her with this object in view and at the expense of her own individuality in a word sir andrews schemes crash to the ground just as surely as did these of sir austin feverel and we never like penelope better than at this moment when her eves are at length opened the conclusion is of course obvious sir andrew marries norah after all and penelope becomes the wife of mr reginald maurice wvho thanks in no small measure to her frank criticism of his verses has very wisely abandoned the role of a miner poet for that of an active partner in a big shipbuilding firm readers of  fancy farm  will we feel sure find eversatisfaction in this workingout of mr munros entertaining story despite the prominence into which she is thrust penelope is not nearly so sympathetic and so lovable a character as norah all the forcible and original savings which are put into penelopes mouth fail somehow to convince us and we are left cold by them with norah it is quite otherwise and we can only account for sir andrew having remained blind to her essential supericrity for so long a time by the presumption that he had not acquainted himself with the lessons of  the blue bird in addition to the leading

then suddenly anna elizabeth under a different name comes into a property in germany and the authors special charm flows back in its entirety she is very lovable this anna with her childlike tenderness and simplicity and her quivering desire to mother the sad and comfortless ones of existence the proposal to share her home with twelve of these forlorn and lifebattered sister women results in some shrewd and rather humorously touching character sketches it is the personality of anna herself nowever that largely gives the book freshness the anna incapable of thinking an evil thought and whose natureworship was one of the most unstrained and poetic faculties under heaven  the reneactress by the author of  eliza beth and her german garden macmillan co may readers who were taken with the charm of  elizabeth and her german garden will be not a little curious to discover how its author can succeed in a regular and fairly lengthy novel like  the benefactress their feelings after reading it will probably be rather like that of the irishman on the subject of his pig which proved to be not so fine as he had expected but then somehow he never thought that it would the qualities which were most attractive in the earlier bookits sprightly irresponsibility and sweet unreasonablenesscannot be so conspicuous in a work written under stricter conditions of art and it must be admitted that what we lose in consequence is not counterbalanced by any new and unexpected excellences the novel indeed judged by the ordinary standard does not take a very high place the plot is indifferent the interest is seldom keen and the characters are not drawn with any great depth or vigour but it is savedand some will think even handsomely saved  by its genuine and unforced humour much can be forgiven the writer who possesses a real sense of fun and makes readers share in it and there are passages in  the benefactress which move one irresistibly to laughter on the subject of german life and character  their ludicrous side at leastthe author is always entertaining the sketches of the country parson the inspector and his wife and other of the minor characters though superficial enough are extremely diverting and there is that rarest of all creations a child perfectly natural in speech and thought by virtue of this humorous element together with a knack of bright and easy composition the book makes its way into our good graces in spite of everything and persuades us to a conscious and cheerful indulgence of its shortcomings  the benefactress by the author of

tries to take and worse still tries to make her readers take au grand sirieux the comedy of anna estcourts grand philanthropic scheme would be bright and entertaining if  elizabeth  were not always

attractive in  elizabeths  hands it is neither it is just a little sad and a little pitiful and a little tiresome perhaps it is all very lifelike but only a genius of the highest rank can make a

prudence palfrey  is a short story and its winding up is so rapid that we can fancy it written as well as intended to be read on a railway journey and that the finale was dashed off as the train whirled screaming into the terminus  prudence palfrey is a pretty orphan heires3 of her guardian old mr dent the old gentleman was attached to prues mother and is now very much inclined to keep prue for himself altogether but mr dent has a penniless young nephew john and john falls in love with prue and she is more than half in love with him john doesnt speak to prudence but he tells his uncle all about it like a frank honest fellow as he is and when the uncle is very angry there are high words between them and john makes up his mind to go golddigging to california before he sets out the young people have one little accidental meeting remembered ali their lives afterwards john is too wise to ask for any promises he goes to put money in his pure and will come back for prue he tells her when he is rich prue says slyly but suppose i have married  old robin gray in the meantime and john replies generously  you are free to do it they part and prue waits heavyhearted till the crown shall become a pound and her john come back to marry her it seems doubtful however whether this will ever occur for john meets with a villainous chum who robs him of all his gains and escapes with the plunder leaving the luckless lover to begin all over again prudence waits three years uncertain whether john is alive or dead meantime old mr dent is laying his plans at home a new clergyman has been introduced chiefly by his influence into the old brick church the rev mr dillingham is young rich highlyeducated and of a serious disposition all the young ladies of his congregation set their caps at him he is charmed with the society of mr dent and his ward  though his manner to prue is never that of a lover and prue is a little nettled to find that she has so little power over the interesting and popular young clergyman therefore when one day mr dillingham suddenly proposes to prudence she cannot help feeling surprised and pleased and asks for a short respite to consider her answer the time allotted passes away and still prue wavers mr dillingham himself turns the balance how could he be so foolish as to select from all j the music on the piano that one little scotch song for prue to sing to him it is auld robin grey  and prudence sings with a strange passion breaks down and hurries away to her own room she can sing no more to mr dillingham that last meeting with john under the trees by the garden seat has she ever forgotten it  the old old love has come backfor ever up to this time the story has run on smoothly enough but now on a sudden john comes back a ragged wraith with a broken arm and discovers that the portrait of mr dillingham is the portrait of his villainous chum who ran off with the money bags and has since attempted to shoot john through the head on the same day mr dillingham absconds leaving a bleating and shepherdless flock and several damsels in despair and now discoveries are unearthed like potatoes mr dillingham preached from known authors mr dillingham had a habit of carrying off valuables from his friends houses  and lastly mr dillingham had proposed to and been accepted by a young lady a friend of prues if old mr dent is chagrined at his want of discrimination as regards the character of the enigmatical young clergyman he cannot feel more acutely ashamed of himself than does the reader of the story who has been completely gulled by mr aldrich to the very last moment the fault which most strikes us in the plot of mr aldrichs story is that he does not sufficiently explain though motives of the clerical scamp we are left to wonder what feelings on mr dillinghams part could have prompted him to come a wolf in sheeps clothing into the heart of johns family and why he sent an emissary to track and murder john if he meant to marry prudence and so possess himself of old mr dents money we could understand it but if this was his motive why does mr aldrich engage him subsidiarily to the other young lady who must eventually in any case have published his conduct and ruined his prospects  if mr aldrich intends the clerical gentleman to be a riddle without an answer he succeeds indubitably the story would have been a pretty and complete one and perhaps more artistic if mr dillingham had not been a villain but simply prues other suitorher  old robin gray but it would certainly not have been so excitingnot such a railway novel in fact there is one other character in the story which we must mention before we conclude it is parson wibird hawkins the old man who was shelved to make room for mr dillingham  who had been pastor of the parish for fifty years and of whom the parish was tired  whose dearest wish was that when the spirit of the lord came to take him it might find him in the pulpit of the old brick church who died very quietly on the evening of his abdication sitting in his study with his bible on his knees a brokenhearted man mr aldrich possesses a keen sense of the pathetic as well as of the humorous

jenny bell the courageous adroit indomitable adventuress the earlier stages of whose remarkable career were described in  bella donna and  jenny bell but though the same heroine figures in the three separate publications mr fitzgerald begs that neither of the two later stories may be regarded as a sequel to the first on this point his statement runslest the reader should suppose that the author was  trading as the phrase goes on the indulgent reception of a former work he thinks it right to state that neither  jenny bell nor the present story was meant to be a sequel to bella donna all three make up one storydeliberately planned at the outset and thus subdivided for the sake of convenience that mr fitzgerald is fully justified in thus announcing his series of noteworthy romances we can bear testimony but still his method necessarily renders the two later portions of the voluminous undertaking liable to the principal objections that are ordinarily advanced against sequels no reader can thoroughly enjoy the second unless he has read and remembers the first division of the tale and without a clear recollection of the principal facts of  bella donna and  jenny bell it is impossible to catch the full significance of the concluding story for instance mrs lepel on her first appearance at digby occasions more perplexity than enjoyment to the unprepared reader who is ignorant of jenny bells doings at the penwillion hotel and in like manner throughout seventyfive brook street her conduct will appear more or less unaccountable to spectators who do not possess the key which the prior narratives supply to her eccentric wickedness that the author would have done better for his readers comfort and his own reputation had he put the whole picture on a single canvas there is no room for doubt but after placing the three panels side by side and examining them as a single production we can commend them for their consistency of scale tone and treatment in each section of the tripartite work the heroines characteristics are admirably preserved the scheming governess of the first part is the same jenny who wins her husband in the second and after strange vicissitudes and humiliations dies in the third nor does the writer exhibit any diminution of force in 11 delineating the companions and scenes of her  later years with no less lightness than vigour he describes the life of the countryhouse where the adventuress encounters the man whom she strives to win for her second husband whilst her first choice is slowly drooping into death when the scene is shifted to brook street may fair the story is in some respects less satisfactory dr pinkerton is ably indicated nnd his conflict with jenny for the custody of her mysteriously stricken husband is given with excellent skill but no such doctor as cameron ever lived outside the walls ofa lunatic asylum and il is not made sufficiently clear whether mr lepel is languishing from the consecpiences of his railway accident or from natural failure of nervous power or from poison administered by the wife who would fain be rid of him in order that she may marry severne indeed we are inclined to think that mr fitzgerald lacked decision at this point of his labour and could not make up his own mind how far ho should render jenny the contriver as well as the wisher of her husbands death notwithstanding the defectiveness of this part however the book holds the readers interest and as thc wick d little womans desperate game draws nearer and nearer to a ruinous end the excitement of he drama increases after the defeat of her grand scheme at the very moment when its success seems most probable she never recovers herself but descends lower and lower in digradation and wretchedness and hearty praise

reubens comrade reuben feels some missvings at the coincidence and follows to help em in case of need he arrives almost too late for he finds the ladies in deadly terror they have been robbed of all their valuables ana their unfortunate servant has been half killed by a man whom reuben from their description recognises as his companion he had made off on hearing some one approach reuben has the satisfaction of convoying the ladies home and calming their fears reuben resolves that the one burglary to which he stands pledged shall be his very last and that henceforth he will be an honest man the burglary at squire germans is successfully committed though the robbers have a narrow escape owing to the treachery of the footman their accomplice but they do escape and with a fabulous amount of booty reuben surrenders the whole of his share on condition of receiving the articles which had been stolen from the ladies and the promise of his companion never to claim his acquaintance he then formally takes leave of the  cross purposing henceforth to live entirely  on the square reuben naturally gravitates to the house of the ladies whom he has assisted in their distress  to restore their

reuben is hurt and his adversary receives a wound of which he dies which is a piece of great luck for reuben as it relieves him of a dangerous enemy and starts him with great eclat on the road of

his sentence will permit and become his wife beginning with him a new life in a new world as reuben is still very young there is a fair prospect of years before him in the main subject of the story in the discovery of his father and in the final destiny of the hero the reader will be reminded of sir bulwer lyttons paul clifford the management of the story is however altogether different from that

after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy jewels thy pearls even thy golden crown itself are nothing to me  but if thou wilt take me for thy friend and companion set me on  we have not ottered an opinion on that part ol mr bulwers work which treats ol literature haviptt reserved hi views on thc subject sui a second notice thy right hand at thy little tallie j let nie eat with thee out of thy little golden dish drink with thee out of thy

in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all her might j against it saying  now you xviii have rest enough you ugly frog  but xvhat fell on the hoot xvas not a dead frog but a living young prince xvho looked upon her xvith loving and friendly

nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear

B9021,"['9453025', '4858116']",  the clever woman of the family new novels by the author of  the heir of redclyffe 2 vols macmillan co as there are painters who content themselves with the simplest rural scenery and make charming pictures without going beyond the limits of a single grassy lane so there are novelists who can make ub take an interest in ordinary domestic characters and have no need to borrow much aid from historical incident or from the glittering armoury of fancy in order to excel in this minute and realistic school of writing it is necessary to observe with diligence and to delineate conscientiously  for the whole merit of the composition must lie in its accuracy of form and colouring miss young is one of our most successful writers in this particular sphere and it is evident that she spares no pains to discover fresh varieties of character or to define them sharply and distinctly for this reason her stories are generally worth a good deal of study though they may not be acceptable to those who like to read only of perilous adventures and terrible surprises the clever woman of the family is well written and teaches a good moral namely that it is bad policy for a young lady to set up for being more intellectual than the rest of her sex the heroine is a young lady miss rachel curtis by name who thinks herself a femme savante at fiveandtwenty and brings the power of her mind to bear on all who come within her reach in contrast to her there is a lady temple a young widow with halfadozen noisy little incumbrances whose gentle nature makes her submit superficially to the strong mind while her natural good sense and the presence of a protecting major prevent her from becoming entirely a victim on this ladys arrival with her six young urchins from australia cousin rachel attempts to take charge of the schoolroom  but all her efforts to teach the children are futile and she is obliged to give it up in despair not to mention the usual boyish disinclination to work which they possess in its most lively development these precocious young gentlemen look upon cousin rachel as a civilian and being themselves the sons of a general officer they think it scorn to take orders from one who bas never smelled powder miss young seems to understand the eccentric ways of boys pretty well but she scarcely appreciates the trials of the unprotected lady temple surrounded as she is by halfadozen young imps of mischief at first we feel a hope that she will marry major keith whom the boys respect as a military man and who is muscular enough to reduce them to order if they rebel we soon find however that the major is still attached to ermine williams a young lady whom he knew many years before but from whom he has been separated by family circumstances and by the vicissitudes of his military life this younglady is evidently intended to sit for the portrait of a really clever woman  for she writes numerous articles in the traveller and even edits it for a time while rachels lucubrations on curatolatry and other recondite subjects are  returned with thanks a terrible accident has rendered ermine almost a cripple and for a long time she steadily repels the majors matrimonial proposals though she has no strength or inclination to banish him from her presence how things are brought round at last we must leave our readers to discover by a perusal of the book but we may mention in the mean time that rachel finds her lord and master in a young officer named alick keith who subdues her by quiet irony as completely as petruchio overpowered katherine by violence there is some humour in the character of alick who never contradicts but shows his difference of opinion by feigning a prompt acquiescence  so that at last we find poor rachel exclaiming  oh alick why are you agreeing with me  have i baid anything very foolish  we are of course rather glad at first to see the haughty rachel taken down a little but we feel a touch of compassion when she has fallen to this fearful pitch of degradation  an underplot of some ingenuity is introduced for the purpose of clearing the character of a brother of miss williams who has failed in business and lives abroad he proves such an uninteresting individual when he comes over to england that we are not sorry when he goes out to the oural mountains again the cottage life of miss ermine williams her sister alison and their 1 ittle niece is prettily and naturally described but there is occasionally an overminuteness to which we must venture to apply the epithet niggling we may say the same of some of the conversations in which people say such very sharp things that the edge thereof is almost invisible to the naked eye upon the whole however the book will be read with pleasure and it has this great advantage over many recent novels that the author has evidently had some personal acquaintance with the phases of society that bhe describes  thte clever woman of the family by the i author of the heir of redclyffe two vols macmillan and coin miss yonges books we are transported into a somewhat mawkish paradise of earnest people everybodyat least everybody worth anythingseems to have every moment of the day occupied either in church services in reading solid books or in fulfilling some kind of necessary or selfimposed duty we can never think of one of her good characters as gossiping or smoking an idle pipe or even as playing at croquet without a set purpose some of thm indeed do these things but then they are the reprobates who come to a bad end and whose indulgence in these habits is but l the outward sign of their moral depravity the freshness of some of the characters in the earlier works of the author carried off the oppressiveness of this intensely moral atmosphere but we fail to find anything to reconcile us to it in the novels which she has lately written in the work before us the want of any relief from this is painfully felt and the purposeless anatomy of small feminine scruples and selfcommunings is carried out to a tedious extent the story is of the slightest turning chiefly on the subjugation of an energetic but perfectly unpractical young woman by a still more energetic officer who conceals his strength of character under a lord dundreary mask then there is an underplot of a damsel who is heartless and plays croquet and marries for money and is killed by a fall over a croquet hoop and some good descriptions of scenery and a large number of supernumerary characters who are all earnest and who all we must say talk and act like living beings and not like lay figures and make us think despite miss yonge that they must have other sides to their character than that she so persistently presents to us we cannot help thinking that miss young writes too much if she would but invent an interesting story and paint a central figure as interesting as was violet in  heartsease and refrain from that minute analysis of unimportant motives in which she is so fond of indulging her powers of description and dialogue and her thoroughly enthusiastic style of writing would stand her inl good stead in the meantime we can only say that the clever woman of the family  is neither better nor worse than most of the later works of the same author i,ovel_contra
