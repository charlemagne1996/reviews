B1486,['8970875'],  the red republic a romance of the commune by robert w chambers putuams sons mr chambers has evidently spared no pains in his effort to render his story of paris in 1871 as realistic as possible apart from the perusal of a number of works on the period he has had the good fortune to consult a copy of the official records of the commune and in addition has been coached up by  revolutionary friends of belleville la villette and the faubourgs montmartre and st antoine on the whole the results if a little overcrowded by detail are decidedly effective mr chambers provides us with a rich feast of horrors and heroism of fanaticism and ferocity in the marvellous succession of hairbreadth escapes which fall to the lot of hero heroine and three or four more of the erincipal characters he somewhat forfeits is claims to be regarded as a realist but few readers will complain of the romantic improbabilities which lighten the prevailing gloom of this stirring but bloodboltered narrative,history

of poor cottages some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children rom the road others shut up close while all tne family were working in the fields these were often the commencement of a little village and after an interval came a wheelwrights shed or perhaps a blacksmiths forge then a thriving farm with sleepy cows wing about the yard and horses peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses passed upon the road as though in triumph at their freedom there were dull pigs too turning up thc ground in search of dainty food ann

believe that he wrote it but that it was written for him and at a guess by the clever authoress of  london in the olden time to turn from the old loves to the new we do not know where we have met in

childhood like some ol the patent sharpeners that give a hasty edge to the knife at the expense of a rapid waste of metal so does care act on the juvenile spirit and the observer may daily see but too many of such young blades precociously worn thin and so unnaturally keen that like our oversharpened knives they could almost cut with their backs in strong contrast to nelly we have the old man her

the pleasure of being cheateda pleasure so congenial to human nature that in ho absence of any other swindler ve cheat ourselves no one ever played as a practice except for the sake of play  and the

B5631,['3164897'],  when knighthood was in flower by edin cas koden 6s sands there could scarcely be a more temptirg subject for the writer of romance than the lovestory of charles brandon son of a simple knight of suffolk and the princess mary sister of henry viii nor could it we think be more charmingly set mr charles major edwin caskoden forth than in the quaint language of sir edwin caskoden henrys gay little 1 master of the dance only it is well to make it clear that the book is not an historical study it is a lovestory pure and simple and its appeal is to the readers heart rather than to his head it is the widest appeal however and no doubt the example of the fifty thousand americans who have already enjoyed the book will be followed eagerly by as many britons the beautiful and wilful princess has an imperious charm which few will be able to resist and her maid of honour lady jane bolingbroke is only second to her mistress to us indeed she is a more attractive character just as her gallant and determined little knight wins more of our regard than brandon himself who seems a trifle overpowered by the insistence of the princesss wooing the book is full of gaiety and vivacity for sir edwin kas an infectious lightheartedness the author is to be especially congratulated oal the personality of his  chronicler whose innocent and cheerful egotism is one of the most refreshing touches in a bright and delightful story,history

of it is ridiculous affectation we think to deny that the author is not an imitator of the popular novels from which so plentiful an harvest of fame and of something more substantial than fame has been gathered in the sly paragraphs in which the curious coincidence of the two writers treating at the same time of the same political events is roundly stated is evidence enough that mlr smith would wish to be considered as a disciple of the ad great unknown and in good truth be has been largely indeted to the la hours of his magnus apollo his redundant exemplor the whole volumes are pant with that happy imitation which is the peculiar forte of the i author of the rejected addresses to which volume so far as it rcspects the power of successful parody brambletye house forms an appropriate appendage the sources from whence the largesd gleanings have been made for the materials of this work are the historical novels of the author of waverley passim from evelin and pepys amost every historical fact worth the using has been transcribed with occa sional acknowledgment manuscripts have been searched and old records rifled and with much laborious reseatch and patient industry three very entertaining volumes have been concocted we shall be quite satisfied if mr smith will pursue his career of successful paroly with the same talent and though we cannot award him the high honours of inventive genius we are quite sure that all which he does will be worth the reading and since the giant of romance has ceased to come forth in his strength we may be amused by the efforts of those who by the mechanical aid of bolstering and of stilts present us with a lively portraiture of the reposing prototype the work commences at the close of the protectorate and embraces a periol

concludes the first volume we next find jocelyn the hero of the history in paris where under due superintendence and good society he qualifies himself for an accompished cavalier and a good officer it was here that he received from his father the glorious news of the restorationbut brambletye house having been disposed of by the committee of sequestration jocelyn is desired to remain in the french metropolis until his fathers difficulties are removed during his sojourn here louis xiv in the prime of youth and beauty procaimed his intention of ratifying the knights and lidies of is court with a tournament surpassing in splendour all that had preceded it on this occasion jocelyn after the most approved mode in these case provided although but a squire is suddenly called into action in violation of the laws of chivalry and unhorses his opponent amidst the accla mation of the multitude here it is that the sensitive heart of jocelyn receives its first wound from a pair of 4 lustrous black eyes gazing upon hint after his achievement and he at taches himself to his unknown inamorata with a chivalrous constancy which secures him from the intoxicating influence of a dissipated metropolis his attempts to discover the lady are vain and he is recalled to england where he finds his father has married a dutch woman of the unpronounceable name of luffrouv wugshaael the widow of a schudam fisherman the process by which this connexion was formed is highly comic but the effects on the poor baronet are disastnus enough cut off by the penurious habits of his consort from every accustomed comfort and the last man to he satisfied with begsarly cheer the gambling of his stomac express itwif very inteiligibly by his lips and a ludicrous state of domestic tyranny is the result of this unhappy union like most of the cavaliers who attached themselves to the monarch in his misfortunes sir john expnences the neglect of the court son however finding brambletye house tont at all to his taste under the tyranny of his dutch stepmother comes to london with a letter of introduction to the celebrated lord rochester and after some maneuvres on the part of that aristocratic eccentric obtains an interview with tie king who confers on him the appointment of vice chamberlain to the queen he is now duly installed at court and the licentious profligacy that resided there is very minutely detailed on the warrant of the best historical evidence but we are tracing thie progress of the novel too minutely for those who love to be surprised and we fear that we way be weakening the effect by anticipation we will therefore omit what occurred at court and the cause which made the hero again a fugitive from his country he is consigned by the kindness of a friend to a dutch burgomaster in whose daughter he discovered his longlost inamorata  of the lustrous black eyes we will not attempt to trace our hero through the subsequent bustling scenes in which he was doomed to act and suffer with all his passionate idolatry for an unknown being there was too much of ethereal purity in the discovered heroine to attract or fix an earthly passion in the marshes of haelbecki he finds a more congenial love in the friend of the highsouled constantia the third volume is more replete with interest than its precursors the drawsatis persona are all congreaated on english ground the usual forerunner of a denouement and after escapings the pestilence and the fire and sundry moving accidents from court intigue the story terminates happily for all those in whose fate the reader

B7137,"['8766574', '8507622']",  noblesse oblige novels and novelettes by sarah tytler 3 vols hurst  blackett vestinays martyrdom a story of the catacombs by emma raymond pitman hodder  stoughton the spanish barber by the author of mary powell nisbet  co perhaps the latest production of miss tytler an author not without experience might have been fraught with more interest to the general reader if the necessities of custom had not required that the matter of half a volume should be spread out into three taking the most favourable view of noblesse oblige the best friends of its author could scarcely venture to say that it offers anything of engrossing interest either in the characters or in the story yet there are glimpses here and there of humour and intention especially where the author does not attempt too high a flight in the social scale which might have formed as it were the cadre of a good story before the sevenfold process of dilution was applied small countrytown scenes and society might have afforded a good deal of amusement at least we should imagine so from the description of the misses medlar the twicefour blooming daughters of the  first attorney in wellfield  the low and vulgar wellfield wags we are told multiplied the number of the miss medlars to forty the forty miss medlars j then by a natural and wicked association they had changed the miss medlars into thieves the forty thieves innocent though they were of stealing mens hearts they were tall stout passably goodlooking girls their bane was plethora in constitution as well as number few men could serenely contemplate a wife of eleven stone weight any more than thirtynine sistersinlaw happy had it been if miss tytler had traced out the lives of these smalltown beauties instead of giving way to that alluring form of ambition which forces a certain class of novelists in spite of nature and in defiance of art to draw highlife groups for which assuredly they have never had any proper models what can we expect when we find colloquial phrases not used in the upper classes or in any educated class cropping up to the surface continually in certain parts of the book lord wriothesleys illness had seemed nothing out of the common she seems to be learning to live without rest or refreshment of any kind for as small and frail as she is  once they had arrived and got a cup of tea she would be able to chat with phoebe  she felt a vast deal better already and able for any amount of gossip i am glad i have got anything i wanted and am the better of we take these singular specimens of english as we find them here and there and we have only to observe that they are not placed in the mouths of persons supposed to be uneducated or even of the misses medlar but that they proceed either directly from the author or from the more refined personages of the story including the countess of exmoor and her daughter the lady dorothea latimer it is wonderful how the author identifies herself with the great latimers and how she despises the small latimers otherwise  the essex latimers who will succeed to the title in consequence of the death of lady dorotheas brother lord wriothesley yet these despised latimers are kind enough to give a home to lady dorothea who conde scends while utterly despising them and calling them commonplace goodish sort of people to avail herself of the accommodation of their house for the purposes of her wedding the difference between the present earls family and the relatives who are to succeed him and who are of course of the same aristocratic stock is surely a difference twixt tweedledum and tweedledee but the author revels in such a difference and so far from exhibiting it as a personal prejudice in the mouth of one of her characters makes herself a party to it in the most uncompromising and glaring manner in short miss tytler is an oligarch to the backbone except in one particular point and there nature creeps out the two heroines of the story lady dorothea and miss phoebe pas ton are both wooed by men of rank yet they both condescend to marry men of far inferior positions thus the independence of the sex is vindicated and the authors female conscience is saved it will be better for her readers and herself if in future works she makes her matter in some degree commensurate with her space and abstains from the attempt to describe phases of society with which her acquaintance is evidently imperfect passing to the second work on the above list we come to a tale of other times but one which is also of serious earnest quality as almost all visitors to rome have joined a party to see the catacombs and have made their way through the narrow passages lined with the empty restingplaces of early christians pausing now to observe a phial of blood now some ancient device on the wall it is likely that the present story will revive many interesting associations miss pitman promises to introduce us to the life of that roman community which was addressed in an epistle and was visited by st paul and which dragged out a troubled and anxious existence under the shadow of the emperor nero vestina who gives her name to the story is a noble roman maiden aud a convert to christianity at first she keeps her religious change a secret but after a time her mother and her brother follow her example and they are martyred before her but there are other and much more important characters in the story miss pitman tells us at the end that many of the incidents here recorded are historical facts and could have been presented in a series of historical chapters but to many minds the thin disguise of fiction is more attractive and to many more the dry historical account seems repulsive while they will welcome the same information in this form it is for this reason no doubt that st paul himself is brought on the stage and that we are shown the apostle during his first visit to rome arguing with the jews and preaching to christians in the hired house where he was suffered to dwell with the soldier who had charge of him several names mentioned in st pauls epistles occur also in the story onesimus demas alexander the coppersmith take a prominent part on the whole miss pitmans work is a fair sample of the religious historical story there is a certain superficial verisimilitude in the use made of the smallest biblical hints and in the working out of characters whose names and leading peculiarities alone are mentioned by the apostle miss pitman enters sometimes into the spirit of her story and the description of  vestinas martyrdom or rather of her timely release from martyrdom is simple and touching when we are told however that the facts presented to us might have occupied a series of historical chapters we feel bound to point out the abundance of grave errors in the historical parts of the story miss pitman has apparently taken her dates from the margin of her bible and seeing there that st paul arrived in rome ad 63 and that the epistle to philemon was written a year later she has not scrupled to bring in the story of onesimus the slave and to describe his being sent back to his master even with these materials before her she has made a mistake for in this epistle st paul speaks of demas as his fellowlabourer while according to miss pitman demas had already forsaken the apostle but the other facts which have to tally with these dates are still more unfortunately chosen we read that in ad 63 vespasian had defeated the jews vespasian was not sent against them till the year 66 nero is represented in the same year as accompanied by his young wife octavia he had put her away the year before and had married poppaja a few days afterwards the late attempt to rehabilitate nero seems to have led miss pitman to state that he set the city on fire to satisfy a brutal jest  as is now universally believed from corroborative testimony the peculiar felicity of the word  now  appears most strongly when we remember that modern criticism has shaken what ancient historians believed but if in this case ancient opinions are attributed to the moderns modern words are in return ascribed to the ancients miss pitman talks incomprehensibly of the  bagnio or public way to what language does she think that word belongs  yet even this is outdone by the statement that the part of rome lying beyond the tiber was called in ad 63 the trastevere what possible sense that name could have till the river itself had become the italian tevere instead of the latin tiber or tiberinus we must leave to miss pitman to discover when she says too that  to dwell in the trastevere was to be accounted among the scum and offscouring of the inhabitants we cannot but feel for the good name of that friend of horaces who lived far across tiber near caesars gardens after these specimens of miss pitmans mistakes we need hardly add that the laliclavu8 or broad stripe was not worn on the toga or upper garment but on the tunica or under garment that pan was a greek deity and not  the god of the country among the romans and that the lupercalia were not festivities in his honour but were offered to the god of fertility accuracy on these points is a minor consideration though it was hardly necessary for miss pitman to enter into details which she could not verify her other blunders are much more serious and affect the value of her book we abandon neither serious purpose nor grave mistakes when we come to the third of the above works in punch for the year 1844 will be found one of those humorous paragraphs illustrated with quaint woodcuts by thackeray and called forth by a statement in the times of the day to the effect that some british society had hit upon a novel plan of introducing tracts into spain viz by bottling them securely corked these same bottles were cast adrift at the entrance of the bay of cadiz and being washed on shore by the tide found their way landwards through the medium of the sailors  so no doubt  reported the agents of the parent society thackerays humorous paper is in the form of a remonstrance addressed to espartero then an exile in england there are three illustrations no 1 depicts a sailor waistdeep in the sea clutching a bottle floating towards him on the crest of a wave  rum praps exclaims the excited salt no 2 the same sailor on shore a fellow salt and a boy personating audience he is in the act of inserting the screw into the cork and exclaims  sherry i hope no 3 in withdrawing the cork he finds some paper adhering and with disappointment dismay and contempt depicted on his countenance exclaims  tracts by jingo the title of this book the spanish barber by the author of  mary powell suggested  rum praps and a perusal of the table of contents and the first chapter led to sherry i hope this chapter has much of the power of this quaint and original writer but a further perusal induced disappointment and the exclamation of tracts by jingo involuntarily escaped our lips miss mannings story is evidently written for the purpose of what is termed in the exeter hall vernacular  doing the good work a certain lay figure is set for the converted sinner who goes on converting other sinners in a style of simple addition quite delightful to contemplate given a spanish barber locality gibraltar who shaves a lay figure named caravantes probably so called because the barber quotes cervantes and boasts that he knows the adventures of the knight of la mancha by heart proverbs and all the shavee converts the shaver at once the shaver his wife they quote texts and the shaver decides to close his shop on sunday this naturally curtails his trade but he pursues the  good work leaving his wife in the charge of and to be maintained by her parents he crosses to oran as a colporteur laden with a sack of tracts he lends a shivering jew his cloak who returns it by the hands of his son a delicate youth consumptive of course this young jew is converted his father smothers himself with dust curses the barber and dies a  contrabandist is introduced who uses very coarse language and cuts the throats of his fellow creatures without the slightest compunction he repents conveniently and ever after trades honestly paying all importduties in a very  goodygoody manner indeed no englishman worthy the name he bears will speak slightingly or contemptuously of true religion nor of those who seek to carry the godly precept of loving ones neighbour as oneself into daily practice but goodygoody stories like the present serve no purpose worthy the name of purpose  and such a pen as that which traced mary powell should leave such  good work  to smallbeer chroniclers of the  moral pockethandkerchief school by the way the equivalent to barbers shop in cast il ian is la tienda dd not de barbero every one interested in spain and her noble people may well echo the authors concluding text  then shall violence be no more heard in the land wasting nor destruction within her borders but the lord himself shall be her everlasting light and the days of her mourning shall be ended happy the people that are in such a case happy indeed but we are not sanguine that the spanish barber will contribute towards this millennium  hobl olige by suarali tytler in three volumes thurst and blackett we hoe th book will not be translated into french or ge t is not meet that the daughters of oath and askelon should look at such a degrading spetale of english life as is here preeentedtous it a true picture we are forced to ask is it true that we a nation of snobs whose pitiful abject snobbishness is far more deeply ingrained than anything that theray for mere fus ske described  or must we say that the picture is morbidly unnatural and that an intelligent and clever woman who has written some good literature has made a blunder and overreached herself in aiming at strong artistic effect  the latter alternative is the less humiliating of the twor but in place ol electing to sa by it we shall endeavour to present the teader with such characteristics of the boob as may enable him to judge whether miss tytleri char is pr or not proven the body of this book we maintain is in elf a charge against the english nation and if miss tyer were a red republican working under flse colours he could not have written anything more damaging to the principles and fielings which she a ntly advocates i noblesse oblige is lhe story of an earls son who falls in love with an artists daughter the brockootes family seem to have a notion that the leaders of englih politics must necessarily spring from the old tic families and young lord wriothesley is the coming hero he is to gain for the exmoors the glory of great reputation and his sister lady dorothea is to strengthen the family by a rich match lord wriothesley is rather infirm of purpose for instead of passing reform bills and organising emigration schemes he falls in love in a sort of helpless fashion with phoebe paston the artists daughter lady dorothea on the other hand knows her duty and performs it she is about to may a lord fairchester whom she does not particularly love then she gets to love him very much then it turns out that there is a mistake in the title atid then the young woman who is represented as a miracle of goodness aned kindness and honor turns him off  if lord fairchester is reduced to john blount she observes tranquilly to phxebe he will be no match for dorothea latimer owe exmoors have always sacrificed our private feelings and had not to do with mwial1iianvx when she parts with her lover she informs him that their two souls are united for ever which means we presume that her delicate sense of honour will not prevent her marrying her body to somebody else meanwhile lord wriothesley dangles after the artists daughter much to the discomfort of her other lover an artist whose only comfort is that wriothesley is a good young man and means no harm he had no doubt thwt lard wriothesley was of such a set whitewashed and vituos os became a latimer but man enough to have his iudividual tastes although peer enough to hanker after forbidden fruit lord wriothesley could not have phoebe paston mny more than the prince of wales could have had her but he could admire her court her and dangle after her in a dilettante virtuous iatimer fasbion only robbing her of her virgin fancy her maiden meditations the first bloom of her heart phoebe is a curious young woman who has occasional fits of satllennew and frequent fits of loquacity strangely enough she has a horror of reviewers and rates them so sudly that in selfhumiliation we cannot forbear to quote her speeches it must be said however that phoebe has just been paid a visit by her cousin frank hall a reviewer and by a stranger and this is the fahion in which she receives and entertains her guests  but the

presume it is with a subtle sarcasm that she represents his preferring the wines at the gartick club to those of lord exmoor phoebes father is an artist of great reputation who looks upon himself as a sort of vassal or serf of the exmoor family the other characters are unhmportant now it would seem that the great occupation in life of these people is to talk of the differences of class indeed the word  class  crops up in these  pages until we get heartily sick of it two women almost strangers meet hurriedly in the street they have not seen each other for some time and the one asks the other how she likes the place phoebe replies that she has every reason to speak well of the people whereupon mrs edgecumbe immediately points out that such people are necessarily unknown to her  you see i have known my class these thousand years and the other is not at all in my way poor phoebe she is beset on all sides by  class  and it is an open question whether one ought to be more ashanied of the despicable titleworship on the part of her neighbours or more disgusted with the profound selfconsciousness of rank on the part of her grand friends lord exmoors family talk as if they had just acquired their patent of no bty and were overcome by the new sensation even the mild and characterless lord wriothesley when he visits phoebes father has to beg that there will be no fuss made about him and hopes that paston will not turn courtier but the oddest exhilbitions of this feeling occur in its reflex action upon the people around phoebe is writing to lady dorothea and she says is it not the boast of the ermoora that they have once and again at such seasons jeopardied lands and life for king and country  may not we follow at a distance and hazard in our turn our small private fortunes for the credit of our friends and our class is there no noblesse oblige in the middle rank and the mercantile world also p forgive me for likening myself to you lady dorothea but i wish you could see my uncle now he sets himself to breast the blast and begin life anew with my aunt standing by and fairly for etting that she used to take a great deal out of him and demand special consideration from him for being a wingfield of batty and wingfield a norman mercantile house in these parts lady dorothea now more eagerly deferential to him than i could have imagined a woman a little hard and exacting in her better days could under any circumstances become  a norman mercantile house  is excellent elsewhere phoebe remarks of her titled friends  they are great people and as such perfectly exceptional no more to be measured by small people in their actions and the consequences of their actions than kings are to be measured it was probably owing to her deference to this divine right of great people that phoebe although she loved barty wooler and was by him beloved invariably snubbed him in order to remain single and let lord wriothesley flirt with her indeed she looks forward to the certainty of his proposing to her and she allows her neighbours to talk of the match as settled without taking any particular thought as to what she must do should he be so indiscreet phoebe has a great liking for lord wriothesley but then she is of opinion that  love and love alone can cross securely the chasm between clas and class and so she allows matters to drift apparently hoping that lord wriothesley would marry her and yet not removing barty wooler too far out of reach finally lord wriothesley dies and then she falls back upon barty and marries him she admits that she might have married lord wriothesley  out of pure gratitude loyalty and reverence but that her heart was b alty s the time we hope barty liked the position dy dorotheas affairs end in a marriage also for she at

those who remember her in the days of 4lady audleys secret eleanors victory and such palpitating volumes it is better however to write an historical than an hysterical novel if the line of writing must be changed and we are grateful that the first has been chosen in 4london prideand again in this present book she deals not with modern villainy injured innocence or ennui but with old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago historical novels are just now legion because even the novelist of the simplest type thinks it a point of honour to prove his versatility by a specimen of the genus plenty of models and easier access to sources of information of course help the fashion many of these novels are it is true models rather of what the historical should not be than the reverse still others of a better kind are not infrequent on the whole in high places belongs we should say to the latter species yet there is much that is tiresome and a good deal that is unnecessary the author has to some extent read well and wisely but the reduction of her material would have still further proved it the tragic days of our own charles have been chosen and many great figures are introduced though not invariably in person buckingham mazarin the queen of france are some of those met face to face also members of an artistic parisian coterie not found in many novels of the epoch the matter is certainly varied  would we could add that it is as vivid as varied interesting passages and wellpresented situations occur but mixed with much that is to speak frankly the reverse of entertaining

romances of the kind its main features are those which are commonly found in these stories it is written in the form of autobiography it involves love and fighting alternately in nearly every chapter and it concludes with the promise of happiness for the most worthy of the dramatis persona it is a story of the days of the league and of the due de guise and henry of navarre and so far as the subject only is concerned it has just as much right to be called the story of a gentleman of france as any similar work of fiction the bulk of the book is concerned with the years 157885 its distinguishing feature is the care with which the writer describes the persons of the leading characters such as henry iii guise and henry of navarre and these portraits in prose are worthy of the attention of those to whom historical novels are still attractive we can recall none in which this element of interest is more prominent or more interesting it would be unjust to outline the plot which is fairly original and logically worked out the writer is an adept at describing a duel the dialogues are not the most satisfactory portions of the book though expletives and words of exclamation are never used wrongly it should be mentioned that the subtitle of the book describes the story as drawn from the recently discovered memoirs of the sieur de la tournoire  the name of the

whether sir john i iavenne wills it or no lucy is obliged to be taken to an osteria at bordighera where she remains for many weeks now doctor antonio looks too much like rinaldo lrinaldini to suit sir

that doctor antonio has been kind to her she appreciates the great worth of his character she sees th ceaseless efforts that lhe makes for her good and to make a long story short at last she loves him not but what there is a spice of romance in the business 1octor antonio is  nobly born revolutionary troubles have driven him from sicilv wvhere his family were once i great and wealthy he is the high

a tale by the author of lorenzo benoni edinburgh constable  co the same paris galignanithis book is superior as a work of interest to its predecessor constructed after the manner of manzoni there are certain lengthy details which might have been compressedbut the true and touching interest of the story would carry a reader through a much heavier medium indeed except that they interrupt the flow of the narrative the details are not devoid of an interest of their ownand will be read on a second perusal if skipped in the eardonable impatience of wishing first to know ow everything ends between doctor antonio and lucy who is one of the most charming impersonator of an english girl we have met with in the course of many novels the outline of the story is simple it derives its charm from the grace and delicacy with which the details are filled in and the strong individuality impressed upon every point of character scenery or incident the character of sir john davenne is an admirable little bit of comedy and there is a dash of genuine graceful fun about it that could scarcely have been given from an english point of view the gradual melting away of all the dear proud stiff old baronets prejudices and the consequent fair play that is given to his best qualities and his gradual conversion to his daughters faith in doctor antonio is charmingand so is the happy pastoral life they all leael during lucys convalescence as to the sudden manner in which it is brought to a close by the arrival of her brother we might say that it is the settingin of an east wind and a blighting frost in the midst of a soft spring day only that would be a commonplace simile after that point the story grows too sorrowful the events narrated are true and cannot on closing the book be forgotten or set aside as highlywrought incidents in a novel the interest that began in the simple overturn of a carriage and the consequent detention of the party at a small ostcria in sicily darkens and complicates into the political tragedy of the 15th of may 1848 the picture of the state of thingsthe trial of the prisoners given in all the naked detail of an official report makes the concluding pages of the story too painful for though ephemeral interest of a work of fiction and as a matter of art a novel has no business to wind up with a lengthened police report we suppose the author does not mind sacrificing his credit as a novelist to have the opportunity of keeping alive in the memory of english readers the details of events which heard imperfectly at the time may have become somewhat obscure and obliterated we cannot dismiss  doctor antonio without a word upon the pure and flexible style in which it is written the english is excellent and stands upon its own merits but when it is recollected that it is the english of a foreigner it becomes wonderful,history

passage of the book the early summer of 1792 was ripening the wheatears and darkening the vine leaves about the hamlet of fayeauxjonquilles the season was too far advanced however for showing the appropriateness of its sweetsmelling name or for proving that it had contributed in its day to the four thousand crowns worth of jonquilles spent on the progress of the great monarch to chantilly

to its thorough dramatic style not in the sense of an acting play but of one written for the closet never straining after effect and every page adding fresh proof of the unusual power of the writer and of the careful pains and study she has bestowed upon her work differing in the details of its manipulation from that of the waverley series there is still the same key to its inspirationa thorough knowledge of the spirit of the time in which the action of the tale mioves rather than the reproduction of the dry bones of past events scott knew well this secret of his art and so made the historical novel his own and many as have been the attempts to follow in his footsteps as yet failure or at least but partial success has been the chief result stepping out of the beaten track of those who consider the historical novel rather as a chronicle of facts than as the exponent of thoughts miss tytler manages to centre the chief interest of the story around the changing fortunes of the owner of the old feudal tour de say and his familyvicissitudes of which the description would be both trite and commonplace but for the skilful way in which are laid bare the workings of the human

existed principally in connexion with meals but there could not be a huger mistake than to suppose him in consequence a nobody on the contrary wherever he went he became the presiding genius of the kitchen where asking and receiving cart blanche he installed himself in the admiring confidence of the chief of the department he entered so completely heart and soul into businessthrew himself so disinterestedly and generously into the choicest most recherche achievements for the entertainment of the chateau or hotel in which he was guest that like his less endowed marquise he emerged from his field of enterprise in a collapsed condition sat with halfclosed eyes or slumbered outright till the moment of trial when the fillet a la du barry or the salade i la volaille rewarded his great qualifications and covered him with glory then the marquis was at his culminating pointthen he not only carved and sent round a dish as a finished artiste would dispense it but he rendered it

provence a spectator above all a convive could easily discover that the withered brighteyed old nobleman had lived at a time when dainty eating and famine were two of the institutions of france and when supper was one of the things to live for he was not malicious or tyrannical rather like most unrivalled men of science he was goodnatured and affable that he was likewise perfectly careless of all outside his own range was an unlucky not a remarkable abuse of his powers monsieur de lussac would really have preferred the whole universe to profit by his cftelettes and crmes since that was impossible he believed sincerely that men might as pivy i well perish of inanition as swallow garlic soup with a taste of artichokes the plot of the novel is well sustained to the end it never flags

of the condemned at the foot of the guillotine are told with deep feeling and pathos few novels have afforded us so much pleasure in the perusal nor can we lay th e book aside without calling

gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis

the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original

this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of

1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the

whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but

the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to the story of doctor manette as to the history of france here again is a little picture of saint antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sance to wretched bread  yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the

B3641,"['6670816', '8986856', '3278414']",  the ms in a red box lane 6s tue mystery of the ms of this story has been so much exploited that we need not refer to it further here save to pay that the book itself comes rather as an anticlimax for though it is a pleasant and reasonably interesting book it is no better than dozens of volumes which have appeared during say the past three years the author has a faculty for narrative sufficient invention and enough knowledge of his period to carry the thing through  in a word he is a good mechanic but there is no characterisation in the story the hero is the very type of the conventional hero and the three villains are very types of the conventional villain the hero sails triumphantly through all dangers to happiness and the lady and the villains come by their deserts there are a good many minor characters but they come in merely as accessories indeed the experienced reader can tell at once just why they make their appearance but all this is not to say that the book is not goed of its kind the setting is careful and accurate and the conflict between the folks of axholme and the dutch engineer vermuijden who had charles the firsts authority to drain and embank the isle is vigorously described the manner of the book smacks rather of wardour street purely modern phrasing and almost slang clash unpleasantly with an artificial archaism but here again the author merely sins with most of those secondclass writers of romance with whom at present he must be classed yet the story has promise and a kind of ease and briskness which experience may turn to good account and at least the book is wholesome and manly and cleanblooded  the ms in a red box lane the author of this romance has had the good fortune to hit upon a period in history which has not been hackneyed by general use we remember no other novel in which the draining of the fens by dutchmen under charles i is the mainspring of the plot it is well known that this improvement roused the fierce hostility of the people of the fens and it is that hostility which the author employs in his stirring narrative thus the tale has this to the good that it has a natural colour particular to it and is in consequence of somewhat a different shape from the multitude of romances technically termed  historical unhappily the characterization has little to distinguish it from the ruck of such performances the hero frank vavasour is the usual brave and reckless young fellow in love with a fair maiden as is habitual with such tales the hero is so headstrong as to run into every danger that a man with a grain of common sense would have avoided as is also usual he tells his own tale very modestly of course and sings the praises of his ladylove not so modestlyas is natural and the two chief villains are exactly what we looked forthe one dutch and the other an english nobleman they are blackened to a hair and could not be whitewashed by the most ingenious perverter of history but of a truth they glory in their shame and are calculated to fill unsophisticated minds with the most passionate feelings of revenge for the colours are all primitive and the drawing is with crayons not that that matters in this style of book it is sufficient that there should be plenty of incident which there is and that the narrative should amble briskly which it does the writing too is of quite a spirited order so that there is little wanting to make a good book of adventure rather above the average and possibly the earnest of better work by its anonymous author  the ms in a red box 6s lane mysterious and ingenious rumours and advertisements had raised our expectations to such a height that  the nis in a red box must hai e been a very e xt raord r in a ry book inceed if it had come ip to them it is not a lery extraordinary book but it is distinctly good and if it had not been so overshadowed by its antenatal reputation it would have seemed even better it is a brisk capable romance of the accepted latterday patterr laid in the lincolinsiire fen country in the reign of charles i  it has the usual fearless but somewhat slowwitted hero who plunges into a fresh peril every time lie goes out of doors is f r e q u e n t i y wounded and once left for eead but always comes through triumphantly the usual faitlful retainer the usual lovely much persecuted heroine the usual dashing villain whose schemes to kidnap her invariably fail at the right moment the usual crop of glaring coincidences and the usual happy end but some of the

B705,"['8675288', '2737970', '8740245']",  lorna doorie a romance of exmoor by rd blackmore 3 vols low  co lorna donne really deserves its title as a romance the tory is well told and although some impatient readers may call the pace too leisurely we think that even they if they once fairly begin it will read on to the end and close the book with regret there is a reality and truthfulness about the story which gain upon the reader as he proceeds the period is laid in the time of james the second aud we are completely transported out of the present day to the england that was when there were no roads at all across exmoor and for a man to travel safely from one town to another required not only a thorough knowledge of all the bogs pitholes soft places and sloughs but much wary walking and great good luck besides mr blackmore is quite at home in the local aspects of somerset and devonshire and he is thoroughly acquainted with the rustic life of england as it was in those days when there was no communication between one town and another except by packhorses for goods and stout nags for men and when the people from another parish were foreigners instead of neighbours when highwaymen flourished and the gibbets which studded exmoor told that some of them fell victims to their profession the story takes us completely into a bygone world the rustic life of england as it was led at plover barrow farm is set forth in a way to make one wish we might have paid a visit to that worthy and stalwart yeoman john ridd the owner of the place and the hero of the story plover barrow farm seems to have been a rustic paradise it is pervaded by a sense of homest labour and wholesome tranquillity with such a wealth of plenty and comfort and warmth that the reader is made to feel as if he had been carried far away from london and was breathing the pure air of exmoor and luxuriating in the good country fare so well and vividly described plover barrow farm had belonged to th same family of yeomen ever since the days of king alfred  and john ridd himself is quite  genuine hero whose fame for great stature and bodily strength and skill as a wrestler still survives in local tradition the story is narrated in the first person by john ridd himself it begins with him as a boy at school fetched home suddenly on account of the death of his father who had been set upon by a party of the doones and killed as he was returning home from market with some of his neighbours now the doones were a family of outlaws and freebooters who had established themselves in a valley on the borders of bagworthy forest supporting themselves by rapine and robbery and were the terror of the country for many miles round these doones are strictly historical personages and the account given of them in the novel is curious the chief or patriarch of the tribe sir endsor doone was originally a gentleman of estate standing well in the county but who owing to some sleight of law or star chamber proceeding had been dispossessed  and then he and his sons and nephews and all belonging to him declared themselves the enemies of law and established this stronghold where they built a village stealing the materials and entrenched themselves a in a camp they were strong handsome godless men who had neither mercy nor scruples they carried off not only horses sheep cattle and money but the wives and daughters of the inhabitants when it seemed good to them they were never brought to justice they were an established power the peaceable people feared them and in time almost got used to them the long immunity enjoyed by the doones throws a curious light on the condition of the western counties at that period these doones play a considerable part in the narrative they are like the giants in the old nursery tales and john ridd is like one of the champions who used to arise for the deliverance of the country people whoever has read the old nursery story of tom hickathrift will see a generic resemblance in the fortunes and character of though two heroes john ridd is a hero of what we flatteringly call the genuine english type he is brave modest and upright scorning lies and mean actions gifted with enormous bodily strength which stands him in good stead in his various adventures and dangers we cannot give an outline of the plot for it is a series of incidents how john ridd ventures into the very heart of the doones valley when a mere boy and how he there finds a beautiful fairy princess of eight years old named lorna doone granddaughter as she believes herself of the grand old sir endsor dooneand how he devotes himself to her and how the love he bears her grows np with him and continues the good influence of his lifehow he goes to see her at intervals though

her and to burn the bidda out of house and homeand how they are repulsed though john ridd will not shoot his enemy carver doone because guns seem treacherous weaponsnl how lorna turns out to be no doone at all but a great scotoh heiress lady loma dugal who is fetched up to london made a ward in chancery and put under the guardianship of her uncle the earl and how she remains always faithful to the good john who has a narrow escape of being hanged by col kilke after the battle of sedgemoor in which he had taken no part except to help a wounded man upon the field and how that was the means of his being sent to london where he not only meets lorna but has an adventure with burglars which makes him much talked ofand the king bestows upon him the honour of knighthood and a coatofarmsall this

and earnest eloquence she died upon the verge of womanhood cut off in the very springtiae of her beauty and of her intelligence how great a loss the world sustained is seen now in the succession of posthumous works which her sorrowing friends have published which she with the modesty of genius supposed to be unfit for the public eye because they did not come up to her own ideal standard of excellence but the welcome that has been given to all of them and their undoubted merit shows us what she would have been had it been the will of providence that her genius should ripen to maturity god however thought otherwise and took her pure and holy spirit to himself the daysof bruce is another of her fictions a composition of her early youth but full of beauty her purpose in this story is to depict and develop the character of woman in vamious situations of trial in isabella of buchan we have a picture of a heart wounded in its affections but trustful and hopeful in its misery in isoline the selfinflicted unhappiness of a too confident and selfreliant nature and in agnes  the overwhelming of a mind too much akin to heaven in purity and innocence to battle with the sorrows that beset her path of life guacie aguilan knew the female heart better than any writer of our day and in every fiction from her pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of the motives and feelings of womans nature the days of bruce possesses also the attractions of an extremely interesting story that absorbs the attention and never suffers it to flaz till the last page is closed and then the reader will lay down the volume with regret mrs nehtox crotand better known perhaps as caiiilla toomxin states in her preface to lydia a womans book that her design was to depict certain phases of life  from a womans point of view and that in doing so she has sought chiefly the approval and sympathy of her own sex the story like all of mrs croslands productions has a wholesome moral not preached however but shown a lesson which the reader learns without the appearance of learning conclusions which he draws for himself with the pleasurable consciousness of selfinstruction this is a groat art in fiction known only to the better class of writers and were we find it we mav be sure that we have passed out of the region of commonplace and are in the company of an author not of a mere scribbler and pretender to authorship mrs cnoslands lydia is an exquisite portrait of a true woman the story is thoroughly rational and probable but never dull she possesses indeed the rare faculty of creating an interest in ordinary things and persons by the charm of her descriptions in short she is an artist  her books are works of art carefully designed conscientiously composed corrected with care having an aim and a plan and therefore not only delighting readers of all classes but commending themselves to the intellectual who desire in a book something more than a mere pastime who rquire it to be like a good picture a menti study and such is lydia miss foudriviers little volume our seto parish is a collection of bketches and short tales which we should have commended very highly had they not been preceded by miss mrinet s our lillage upon the exact model of which they are moulded so little indeed does the author aim at originality that she is content to take the very title with a differenceanother yet the same for it will be obvious at once that our new parish is a very palpable plagiarism from our village the words are changed indeed but the meaning is the same and no less stiiking is the likeness in the sketches that are strung together under this title we regret this for really there is a good deal of merit in the writing the authoress has a lively fancy considerable power of description and invention enough to have produced something original let her make the attempt and we have no doubt it will then be our duty as it will be our

year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,history

meet many romantic adventures among others not the least striking may be recordedher rencontre with the earl of essex her subsequent visit to his palace on the thames and the interruption of their interview by the jealous and despotic queen elizabeth our author speaks not lovingly of the  good queen bess but we much suspect quite as she deserves the reader will find these volumes very exciting though he will perhaps regret that excepting in the two principal characters he will not find that unity towards a single catastrophe that tends to make the construction of a novel so complete there is the continued interference of a celebrated and very original villain a count scotus that makes the plot in many parts quite a intricate as that of a spanish play  this keeps up a very absorbing interest and the reader as well as the author must feel much obliged to the wily count lt is a great pity that he is such an unmitigated rascal we hardly think him natural as there is no one redeeming point about himhe is a monster perfect in his villany this novel will be read with pleasure by all those who understand and love good writing and who are prone to take a philosophical view of mens actions and passions as tiley work out the great revolutions of history mr grattan has certainly in this production increased his reputation and done no small service to those who read only for amusement by thus pleasantly forcing upon them a lesson in history at once so excellent and so extensive  agnes de mansfeldt a historical tale by thomas colley grattan o vols saunders fir otley tue main characters and events of this romance mr grattan assures us are strictly historical and may be found in the chronicles of the days when elizabeth reigned in lugland philip in spain and ghebhard truchses was elector and archbishop of cologne with this priest and prince the interest of the tale abides his times were those of change both in politics and religion he inclined to the lutheran side but menaced by fierce neighbours of the romish church it is likely that he would have held fast his allegiance to the old faith but for a visit to his court by the heroine of the narrative the lady was young witty and beautiful she was learned too and her taste in love inclined rather to ripe sixandthirty than to raw nineteen this was fortunate for thc elector his years corresponded with the taste of agnes but there were serious obstacles in the way his station forbade wedlock  she was a heretic too and his subjects were catholics and a perseverance in honourable love threatened the loss of both mitre and crown in this dilemma he was offered the help of au italian count scotus who like his relative martins galeotti was a greedy spendthrift as well as necromancer inspired by the desire of reward from the elector for furthering his love and the hope of sharing in the plunder of cologne scotus pushed on the marriage by visions from thc other world as well os by intrigues in this and succeeded in all but one plot was not sufficient for the genius of the italian he bereaved a princess of saxe coburg of her husbands regard and of her state jewels and would have drowned her in the rhine had he not been thrown into the river himself moreover he plundered and at thu same time imprisoned ernest of liege the electors chief enemy and all but lost count ulrick his life in a love expeditionthe least happily conceived of any incident in the story in short the necromancer is the prime mover of all cologne is stormed by the catholics the elector loses bishopric and principality and deserted by all the world save his own fortitude oud his young and faithful wife ends his days obscurely and happilydomestic love triumphing as it ought to do and seldom does over pride and ambition such is the outline of though story of the characters the most remarkable is count scotus  he is properly the hero the times favoured his pretensions yet we must ascribe something to simplicityfor he had the address to impose himself on priest and prince on maid and matronas a necromancer of the true michael scott breed who had lived several centuries and remembered the looks and words of dante and petrarch he is thus enabled to juggle princes out of their kingdoms princesses out of their jewels and their reputation soldiers out of their lives and though in the middle of the third volume we fairly saxv his last sobs come bubbling up in air from the bottom of the rhine yet wc find him riding in state at the close of the work through some of the alarmed cities of the continent the scene in which he begins to intimate his powers and pretensions is one of the best in thc work 44  in sooth count you do xvith infinite power raise up the images of buried things a xvizards skill could scarce do more said the elector as a short pause occurred after one of the strangers spoken sketches only broken by murmurs of applause from all parts of the table  and my old

tiuchses 4 lather them  why here is raphaels here dantes  hore ariostos name  if gathered it must have hoon in the grave 44 it is easier to outlive ones friends than to give new life to the dead  said scotus xvith a solemnity of tone so strongly contrasted xvith his prexious animation that the whole company felt a thrill of awe in unison with the alniot supernatural meaning implied in the expression 44outlive ones friendsand what arc xve to infer from that count  iiiid though elector smiling as he observed the half awestruck looks of his guestsbut he could not see his own   whatever may seem most pleasing to your highness replied the italian with au air ol resignation and modesty that seemed mixed with sorrow  the great raphael died full half a century ago you ure not quite so

ho who fol lowed the hearse of the man and has rocked though cradle ofthe child may he accurate as to dates of him he loved and honoured thc elector was a firm believer in destiny imagined that slight accidents foreboded great misfortune interpreted all against himself and lived a life of mental disquietude a man duped by himself is sure to become the dupe of others and scotus was the person sent by destiny to wile him on to ruin the young wife of the elector evidently a favourite with the author tried in vain to call his high qualities into action as the storm thickened the angry parley between the elector and his revolted subjects is a scene of great force  we scarcely like so well the one between the necromancer scotus and the princess of coburg when he is ubout to toss her at midnight into the rhine we were a little startled on the score of historic consistency when the banished elector and his lady found the earl of essex with dee the english necromancer groping after his own destiny at midnight among the ruins of theronenne but not so much perhaps as was essex himself when on a visit which agnes paid him in london he saw she was the very picture of mary queen of scots and perceived queen elizabeth at his door to conceal the countess was but the work of a moment for closets are always ready in romances but to conceal her from elizabeth was another matter she had a line tact in seeing through mysteriesthe scene in which she opens the chamber door and mistakes agnes for the spirit of mary of scotland is well drawn it is not new perhaps but it is natural and pleasing to see two nobleborn and nobleminded creatures like the elector and his lady descend gracefully and with little murmuring from their high station and in solitude reap the harvest of affection and philosophy  on no better materials could genius employ itself and though mr grattan has not raised a structure wholly to our mind we cannot refuse him the praise of having created what is both commanding and picturesque ,history

B8743,"['8820984', '3175325']",  new novels a gentleman of france by stanley j wey man 3 vols longmans  co  the house of the wolf  revealed in mr weyman a power in literature and especially in historic fiction  a gentleman of france his new novel will be no less acceptable and is even likely to have a more favourable reception in it the true romantic gift is distinctly apparent as well as that singular vividness of touch which distinguished the great masters of the historical novel yet mr weyman follows no convention too closely he recreates past days of adventure and chivalry and sets in motion for us of today the  old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago with a rare and potent touch he has scholarship to help him but there is not the slightest parade of it he is obviouslyto use a tiresome phrasesteeped in the atmosphere of the sixteenth century and the speech and manners of the time are reproduced without the conventional cliches with which the common romancist does his spiriting the book is not only good literature it is a rattling good story instinct with the spirit of true adventure and stirring emotion of love and peril intrigue and fighting there is plenty and many scenes could not have been bettered mr weyman has chosen his time after the bartholomew and when the henries were in somewhat uncertain relations as may be inferred there are brisk passages between the league and the huguenot gentlemen the fortunes of the sieur de marsac are charmingly narrated by himself though no longer young he is to the full as interesting as more youthful heroes in all his adventuresand they are manymarsac acts as befits his epoch and his own modest yet gallant personality the court where the immortal fortyfive gamed and jested appears more than once and wellknown historical figures emerge in telling fashion under mr weymans discriminating and fascinating touch  novel notes a gentleman of france by stanley weyman 3 vols longmans mr weyman has not only taken dumas for his model but also france for the scene of his heroes prowess and escapades there is something in french historyperhaps the intensity of bitterness in the court factions and the determination and complexity of the court intrigueswhich gives exceptional opportunities to a writer of romance then too the graceful bearing of the french noblesse and the bright french sun bring a tone and a light to a romance not to be borrowed from our rougher old english ways and duller english skies mr weymans france is that of the huguenots and the league the story beginning just before the murder of guise and ending with the accession of henry of navarrea stormy difficult discontented dangerous time comfortable for no one least of all for the poor sieur de marsac breton gentilhomme and huguenot with empty pockets and threadbare cloak in spite of his forty years of honour and bravery the novel of adven ture is only occasionally the novel of character but so far at least as the men are concerned this one is so gaston de bonne sieur de marsac is no shadow with the brave impulses and recklessness of his nature struggling and never in vain against the caution of his years his exceptional talent for illluck his determination to push his fortunes at courtfor a man of his birth there was no other careeryet with no gift of worldliness he is a very real man answering to the necessities of romance and claiming as well our modern sympathies henry of navarre too rosny and turenne in mr weymans hands are not mere labelled dummies but the story is never spoilt by the infusion of presentday sentiment it is the old world of noble and churl with a strong dividing line between them which the gentlest maintained with strictness but humanity is abundantly presentwitness the scene where marsac comes back to his mother at blois to find her dying and stripped of all her belongings the poor tatterdemalion landless seigneur lies to her stoutly about his retinue and his revenues and lets her proud and tender soul go to its rest in peace of course a novel of this kind must obey certain conventions we expect and demand that fair ladies should for reasons of gallantry or politics be abducted at midnight from feudal castles and carried to their appointed place by roads bristling with the most unforeseen and the most aggravating of dangers mr weyman gives us this kind of thing to our hearts content and it is so refreshing a thing that it is well not to quarrel with him because he does not altogether convince us of the importance of the secrets in possession of the fair ward of turenpe the story is written in a style which is not archaic only oldfashionedly formal often of a beautiful simplicity and of real literary quality it is the best relief of all from worry or a depressing course of psychological novels or modern morbidness to plunge into this world of romance that never was perhaps but always is and mr weyman has refreshment ot this kind to offer you which need not be shamed by dumas neighbourhood,history
B3502,['6732133'],  sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think him soour grandchildren will do neither our utmost stretch of indulgence is to excuse the sailor because he was only a sailor sailing away as a boy and all his life from the charmed circle of insular prejudice learning life by living and foreign peoples in their own homes instead of in british parlours lecturerooms and missionary meetings admiral hobart like many another sailor of vigorous understanding unsophisticated conscience and limited culture failed to appreciate the timehonoured prejudice which should have forbidden him to respect in the infidel those very virtues dignity sobriety fortitude domesticity truth generosity and love of justicewhich he had been taught to revere as the peculiar appanage of his own countrymen in his eyes the swindling greek was no better than the corrupt pasha the savage baehi bazouk no worse than the cutthroat bulgarian and none of them half so bad as the atrocitymonger he may be at times superficial and inaccurate but that his main views will ultimately prevail and that the simple adnals of his life now before us will come to be read with keener and more enlightened interest is a prognostication rather than a prophecy e

grand incidents the time of action is laid precisely at that period when the accession of the second charles of england gave the cavalier party in that country and her colonies the great supremacy which in general they used so insolently the story briefly runs thus a brian oreilly with a little boy on his back that he had just saved with himself from shipwreck finds protection for both in the mansion of a mr fairfax a strange name for a cavalier and this boy proves to bc the hero of the story he is brought up with virginia the heroine and daughter of the benefactor when nathaniel liacoti the least heroic of names comes to mans estate he finds himself in love with his fostersister macon though he wishes to go the whole hog with the lady is no beggar private and very ample remittances having been from time to time forwarded to mr fairfax for the expenses of his education and finally for the purchase for him of one of the best plantations in the province now in the vicinity of these good folks there resides one of a character not altogether so unexceptionable but much more romantic  one vast gigantic regicide recluse colonel whalley thc actual husband of mrs fairfax the mother of virginia and as he him elf supposes the father of nat bacon this whalley was long sup posed to have been shot as he deserved and it was only till after this was supposed to be ascertained that mrs fairfax remarried now thc then governor of virginia was a peppery hotheaded addledbrained ultracavalier named sir william berkeley with a reprobate nephew called beverley his heir and successor virginia is an heiress and it is the arrogant governors pleasure that she shall marry his heir bacon puts in his caveat this is the state of affairs when the roundheads rise and endeavour to blow up the governor in his statehouse bacon saves the town from destruction and proves that he has other qualities besides that of  sighing at his mistress s elbow9 to be entitled a hero he gets dreadfully wounded for his pains but thinks himself well rewarded as it is the means of gaining the plighted faith of the lady we cannot even name all the intervening and attendant incidents arising from this position of affairs the reader must suppose a duel a metre with the indians and the introduction of an indian princess with a whampum belt and mocassins all very effective but which has but little to do with the course of the story except in so far as it introduces an opportunity of getting the hero to the stake and his body systematically planted all over with pine splinters preparatory to a roast but the historical and political events are thc most extraordinary for some reasons utterly unreasonable to everybody but the prejudiced old governor he allows the indian tribes to confederate and make head unmolested on the frontiers of his province at length they openly rise and ravage the country with all the ingenious ferocity of the indian the day before wyanokee formerly the servant of virginia now the head of the tribe had saved her bacon from roasting by using the red womans privilege of making him her husband and the day after these espousals without consummation we find the bridegroom in spite of himself proclaimed the general of the army of the colonists to resist the indian invasion and avenge its cruelties we think that here the fiction and the fact are improbably blended though the act of the colonists was necessary to the safety of the state indeed to its very existence the old governor stigmatised it as a rebellion calls in all the regular troops from the outposts on the extreme points of his government intending to fall upon the delivering army in the rear whilst the indian is in the front well out he marches from the capital with this commendable intention when the citizens whom he had left behind thinking this a queer way to save the country march out in the shape of another army to do battle on the governor so there are four armies going to fight each other in a line in the meantime bacon is too active isle annihilates the indian army in his front before the governor has time to attack him in the rear the old man then falls back upon the army at his tail not to right with it but to make all manner of treacherous concessions among which is that of granting regular commissions to general bacon and his officers once again in his capital he attempts to tyrannise as usual but the liberal party is too strong for him and he removes with the ships and the troops that are faithful to him to the town of acomac in the meantime bacon having impolitically left his army to reach the capital the sooner is taken in his passage by one of sir williams cruisers brought to acomac tried by a courtmartial as a traitor and sentenced to be hung of course the reader will suppose that every now and then virginia the heroine makes her appearance just when it is the most heartrending and distressingat this hanging business for example however the hero gets a days grace to prepare himself for death and next morning is found to have escaped from the cellar in which he was confined the governor again returns to jamestown and through treachery again finds himself master of his capital bacon rejoins his army they march upon the town a memorable fight ensues the loyalists are beaten and the town consumed to ashes vir ginia who always had accompanied the governor now falls into the handsarms we should have saidof the hero and they get married and all that we have not recorded some of the most striking scenes because we would not too much forestall the interest with the reader we conclude this notice by stating that the characters are well supported to the end and that the author has considerable powers of description the plot is all through exceedingly well managed and the denouement comes off admirably the faults of the volumes are a little proneness to exaggeration and a dialogue generally too pompous ana elaborate there is but one attempt at the humorous and it is completely successful that of the irish adherent we may promise all who should through our recommendation read this work that they will find we give it upon

wants most of the qualifications of the novelist his descriptions are vague showing an absence of definite conceptions of things in his own mind his characters arc commonplace and nothing more than embodiments of generalities without any of those individualities which distinguish the men and women of real life the plot is the best part of it but taking it for all in all we recommend the

never surely did they put on so bold a frontage of enormity as when charles led the wassail in his dissolute court and titus oats made perjury as common as household words thc characters of this date arc indeed marked and emphatic not softened polished and assimilated like society in more modern days but distinct angular full of peculiarities both of thc individual and the class the sobered tone of a more settled state like the frost which hinds every tiling in its chains was then utterly broken up and thc ocean roar of brawl and anarchy rang through the land no wonder then that these are times in which fiction loves to hold its fairy reign thc author of  whitofriars deserves our attention with many faults he has yet many merits and we would infinitely rather deal with these

all these arc sterling things in the way ol desert and we desire to give them their full weight but still wc must look to the opposite scale now thc object of a novelist like that of the artist is to

in the londox revivw may 16 an attempt and not an unsuccessful one was made to show how little practical sympathy for the degro exists in the northern states but though the writer vehemently pressed his argument he was unable to conceal that while the condition of the slave in the southern states under a benevolent proprietor is far better than that of the free negro in the north nothing can be more wretched than his case if he has the misfortune to belong to a savage mrs fanny kembles residence in georgia which we reviewed in our number of the 6th of june gave us a picture of slavelife on an estate which had the reputation of being humanely managed making allowance for the colouring which a woman possessed of strong feelings and considerable eloquence could not help ging to such a subject the facts which she recounted materially affected our estimate of the creature comforts enjoyed by the slave even under a kind uster the book before us written with strong abolitionist ypathies leads us to believe that humane as mrs kembles husband may have been his estate did not resent a fair specimen of slavelife in the south when mitigate by the benevolence of the owner mr kirkes desrptio xy sother fremda by bdaund kirao autor of asu th phos low son x of the slaves on mr prestons estate shows us the northeast pbis ultra of negro happiness in the south and from the picture he has drawn of their comforts and the paternal care of their owner we are induced to believe that he has blown his bugle more in sorrow than in anaer unfortunatelyr this term  paternal care  has a double imieanimg that a man shall have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing

rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons

sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their

many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob

of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed

the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand before them  rosey was dressed in white with a neat fillet of pink and blue ribbon about her head and ally wore a black frockcoat with white vest and white cotton gloves one of the groomsmena rustic beau from a neighbouring plantationwore an immensely longtailed blue coat with brass buttons a flaming red waistcoat yellow woollen mittens and a neckerchief that looked like a secession flag hugging a lamppost both of these gentry had hats of stovepipe pattern very tall and with narrow bms and they wore them during the ceremony s  silence in de meetin  cried joe  the boisterous sea of black wool subsided to a dead calm those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all the responses with great propriety but some of the congregation seemed less familiar with the service when joe repeated the words if any man kin show cause why dese olks should not be lawfully jined togedder less him now speak or ele fbr eber hole his peace dinah turned to the audience and cried out yas jess less him come out wid it now rd like ter see de man dats got

thou have this woman to be thy welded wife then dinah unable to contain her self longer joyfully exclaimed  ob course he will any youn fellerd be glad to hab htai the ceremony is then completed and is followed by a dance in which master joe prestons son1 makes himself conspicuous as roseys partner in one of the sets for his marvellous dancing but when the young mother is confined her child is white preston to his horror discovers that his son ignorant of the girls parentage is the father overwhelmed by this shock by his wifes cruelty and extravagance and by the hopeless state of his affairs hie dies and now mrs preston learns from phylliss slave husband that selma who has all along been supposed to be prestons daughter of pure white breed is the oflfpring of his amour with phyllis the girl has received the highest education and has grown up into a wouman of surpassing loveliness mr kirke describes her appearance at the opera in boston her mother was almost white her father pure white of such parentage selma is not the only issue famed for extraordinary beauty and now comes the crowning interest of the story selina is bought by her brother joe but frankan adopted son of mr kirkes and the illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread it,history

B1832,['4380498'],  the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the time watched by three brahmin priests in disguise at the taking of seringapatam john hernoastle an english officer is met by one of his relations at the treasury of the palace and under rather suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about the place he starts for the neighbouring town a few miles off and deposits the moonstone with a banker there by the time the birthday iarrives rachel has refused another cousin godfrey ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them sergeant cuff an eminent detective is brought down friud london but rachel refuses to give him any information and strange to say she completely onto her old lover and will hold no communication with him sergeant cuffs suspicions point to rachel herself he thinks that she has used the diamond for the purpose of raising motey to pat her debts and thae she has been aided by rosanna spearman one of the servants a deformed girl who had been brought up as a thief and whom lady verinder had received from a reformatory xnny circumstances point to rosainna as the guilty person the newlypainted door leading to rachels sittingroom has bean smeared and the smear must have been made by thi thiin the night clothing of all the servante is found eorredt but rosanna is known to have purchased sode cloth at the vtiaseand to have been engaged in her own room making aomethi in addition the detective discover that she bhs bought a tin box and chain and sinks them i the shivering sads on th coast and not far from the house this box the egeda it assured contains the uightgou of the guilty penrsn bdsasspearman however commits suicide and the detectivle is at length dismissed by lady verinder leaving the mysterj unexplained in time however all is cleared up a oommunicative assistant to a country doctor had whilst his master wine delirious taken down his ravings and got at the fact that one of the gentlemen at the birthday dinnerpartywe will not disclose the authors secret by saying whowas drugged with opium the assistant is of opinion and finds his view fortified by a passage from carpenters physiology that the dadmul was stolen under the inflreace of the drug and that it is not impossible that another dose way result in the sleeper i  all that he did on the prewis occasion the eperz i tried in the presence of witnesses and a sham diaeod is tva in the same way that the real one had been but be d affording some proof not very strong that the suspeted indivml was not a thief the meas adopted are rsultflss as the sleoini drops the piece of glass upon the floor and sinks off to shop rachels solicitor andl friend 3fr bruff however has good reason for suspecting that the diamond has been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old steward had less to say about robinson crusoe miss clacks narrative is intended to convey the idea of a meddlesome fanatic but it is merely a broad burlesque of the character,history

whatever the defects of the story or the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to

ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it

diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public

B3662,"['9409955', '3433685']",  simon dale two historical romances iii by anthony hope methuen qi nc  co shrewsbury by stanley j weyman longmans  co except he be a fool whose prudence is notoriously limited a novelist must require a good deal of skill and courage to embark on an historical novel for while complete success means that he may have produced some of the most entrancing fiction there is to be read as dumas did and sir walter scott a bad historical novel is associated with the dreariest experiences of the novelreader failure indeed is much easier than success for the disadvantages of introducing historical personages are obvious while it requires exceptional delicacy to seize the right amount of reality which may be allowed in a novel one of the charms of historical novels is the greater footing of intimacy on which they can put the reader with historical personages and the enhanced sense which they give him of their reality claverhouse and fouquet louis xi and louis xiv as real characters are more interesting and living even to the historical student from the pages of scott and dumas and by a kind of reactionary force they get an added interest in the novels from the fact that they undoubtedly existed but this balance must be retained the novelist must not forget that while his ideal i  presentment may add to the reality of real t persons though success of his ideal present i ment depends in a large measure on the j 1 vividness of his real persons in history it is quite possible indeed that a good novel may be written about obscure historical characters unearthed from old chronicles or brought out of the lumberroom of history but their interest is something quite apart from the historical 6ide novels about the early christians for exampleeven dumas wrote one and it was a failure i possess small interest as such because we know so little about them historically that all the information vouchsafed reads liko mere pedautry in such cases the history is a burden and a defect in the novel and the people who unearth obscure polish kings for their novels fall into the same pit it is an essential in a good historical novel that the real persons introduced should be already so familiar that any new detail about them may appear of importance a second essential in an historical novel is that the real characters introduced should be kept to a strictly subordinate position the reason of this is obvious  that as their actions are known to history if they perform one of their real actions in a novel there is no surprise or interest possible in the denoument of an event which is known whereas the possibility of their performing imaginary actions is limited by the knowledge of what they actually did dumas alone was strong enough to allow his characters to perform their real actions in his books but he always got over the difficulties by devising some stupendously ingenious explanation of his own for them as in the celebrated incident which explained how monk became reconciled to charles ii but unless one be a dumas it is better to let the real characters saunter on and off though stage in the way thackeray did with such masterly effect in  esmond imparting a sort of substantiality to the fictitious characters or to make historical events not the central incidents but important only for their influence on the lives of the imaginary heroes as scott did the difficulties which the historical novelist creates for himself are thus obvious as his historical characters must be fairly familiar his range of invention is limited for if he makes them unlike their reputation he ensures disappointment for example a novelist who made louis xiv seem undignified or charles ii a bigot might as well stick to his middleclass love story again if the big men of history have to play a more or less subordinate part great imagination is required to raise the hero to a fitting pitch of sublimity then on the other hand the triumph of the successful historical novel is unlimited the sense of proximity to the richelieus the louis xiv8 the claverhouses or the marlboroughs of history adds an intense thrill to the emotions the conviction that a common musketeer outwitted mazarin or that charles ls last words were whispered on the scaffold to a french adventurer or that mr addison is speaking in real life and not in the spectatar as he does to the common herd is among the most overmastering sensations in literature the added sense of reality which is given to a wellknown event by the immixture of the hero of a romance in it is also no mean part of the joy in a good historical novel anthony hope has very nearly obtained a complete triumph in his simon dale he has chosen an excellent period for the actionthe time of charles il known to us by mr pepys and comte de grammont an audacity in itself deserving of success  and the audacity is all the greater and all the more successful inasmuch as he obviously imitates dumass method in his narrative and actually brings in louis xiv himself as dumas did in le vicomte de bragelonne charles il is excellent he is witty goodhumoured and at the same time a king even when he allows himself to be mocked by rochester or buckingham rochester and buckingham the duke of monmouth and the duke of york all live in our writers pages and the more vividly for his narrative louis xiv himself is all that one is led to expect that the roi soleil should be save in one instancehis leap into the boat we are convinced that louis would never have so far forgotten his kingship as to do that especially as his passion for barbara quinton was evidently a mere whim yet even for this lapse the author wins immediate forgiveness by the splendid use he makes of it and the dignity with which louis carries off his amazingly impossible situation as for the hero he is a perfect hero of romancehe is brave witty adventurous and a good lover and he succeeds in the difficult task of narrating his own prowess without a suspicion of priggishness this is an achievement which dumas himself would hardly have been equal to especially when the hero has to suggest that a lady whom he had ceased to love was all the time half in love with him but this form of narrative is anthony hopes strongest point and one is apt to forget its difficulty in the ease with which he carries it off perhaps the least convincing part of the narrative is the heros calf love for nell gwyn it does not ring quite true but it serves as an excuse for a great deal of nell who is the most charming coquette imaginable for the rest the story is rapid and most excellently told the ingenuity of the beginning and the way in which the keynote of the story is struck almost in the first line are especially remarkable and hardly for an instant does the story flag as simon dale is fighting duels or talking to kings and princes on almost every page  hardly for an instant we said advisedly because here as we noticed in  phroso anthony hope apparently does not quite see where he ought to stop the part after barbara has been brought home seems if the comparison may be pardoned almost like flogging a tired horsenot that it had shown any signs of fatigue before but the final incident with carford and fontelles is too detached from the rest to fit in well and the book would certainly have come to an end with more sparkle if the lovers could have been finally united at though end of chap xx in fact the author seems to some extent to feel the awkwardness himself and his only lapse which is decidedly clumsy from the first person is in this part there are good things in the last six chapters but they are rather like a second slightly inferior course mr weyman is perhaps unfortunate in though fact that his book appears so closely in timo to anthony hopes brilliant novel shrewsbury is anything but brilliantit is somewhat pedantically written with one of those tiresome attempts to reproduce the style of the period and the central figure who is also as in simon dale the narrator is so contemptible a cur that he becomes positively dreary of course it is possible to be interested in a cad and a coward in fiction but when there would have been just as much point in making the man tolerable the persistence of his meanness hurts the story the second hero of the book the duke of shrewsbury is hardly a wellchosen subject for an historical novel he is except to historical students a mere name in history why he resigned office is to the novel  reader a matter of profound indifference and the only really dramatic action known of his his invasion of though council chamber just before annes death is not reaehed in this book william iii comes in and he is not disappointing but it is not at all clear that the narrator was likely to have come into his presence as he did on the first occasion and the whole incident reads as if it were invented to drag in the great deliverer there is however one really dramatic scene the accusation of the duke by sir john fenwick and smith and their confutation by the appearance of though dukes double but this lively 6cene

a misfortune attending the criticism of this new and in many respects able work of sir e bulwer ly ton that those who write on itand indeed those who read itcan scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction if as history it is written with too much of the air of mere invention if as fiction it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler this is an evil attending the choice of the subjectand one which though many have made the attempt only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome to this rare and almost wonderful exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer but we must add that even in that case the experiment however generally successful occasioned many important distortions and perversions of factsand we will venture to say that it has produced especially in the present generation much doubt confusion and error as to characters opinions and events these observations are in a manner challenged by sir e b lyttons dedicatory preface and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes they appear to set up a claim for his fiction notwithstanding his denial of the pretension to the dignity and importance of history we hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily either let us have a production of mere fancy or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards the author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidentshe makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between harold and edith we admit at once that for his purpose he had 1 reason for making the changebecause itrenders the story not merely more interesting but on every account more readable on this point sir e b lytton observes  the love tory of harold nnd edith is told differently from the wellknown legend which implies a leis pure connexion but the whole legend respecting the edeva faira edith the fair whose name meets us in the doomsday roll rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal but which on many accounts i hope may be entrusted fearlessly to the young that is to wy he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawingroom tables and the boudoirs of he ordinary readers of such productions we should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities from hich he clearly means it to be inferred that n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done sobut we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive his archaegy spoils his book as a fictionjust as his departures from the same injure it as history he has thus put a curb on his imagination both regardspersons and eventsand would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints as it is the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader we may be surprised that he can do so well thus loaded but feel sure that he could have done much better unencumbered in fact the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination the description for instance of all that relates to the war of harold against gryffyth in wales is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen we will select our first specimen from this part of vol ii premising that gryffyth his queen and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness and that harold by a monk and a young norman has sent them a message of mercy on submission  as the monk ceased the thrill of the audience was perceptible and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur as if to constrain the king then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man the red spot flushed the dark cheek and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow he made one stride towards thc monk and said in a voice loud and deep and slow rolling far up the hillmonk thou hast said and now hear the reply ofthe son of llewellyn the true heir of roderic the great who from the heights of eryri saw all the lands of the cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of uther king was i bom and king will i die i will not ride by the bide of the saxon to the feet of edward the son of the spoiler i will not to purchase base life surrender the claim vain before men and the hour but solemn before god and posteritythe claim of my line nnd my people au britain is oursall the island of pines and the children of hengist tyre traitors and rebelsnot the heirs of ambrosius and uther say to harold the saxon  ye have left us but the tomb of the druid and the hills of the eagle but freedom and royalty are ours in life and in deathnot for you to demand them not for us to betray nor fear ye o my chiefs few but unmatched in glory and truth fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields no die we may but not mute and revengeletw go back whispering warrior go back false son of cymryand tell harold to look well to his walla and his trenches we will vouchsafe him grace for his gracewe will not take him by surprise nor under cloud of the night with the gleam of our spears ami the clash of our shields we will come from though hill and famineworn as he deems us hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of snowdon illume their pinions to share  rash man and unhappy cried the monk what curse drawest thou down on thy head wilt thou be the murderer of thy men in strife unavailing and vain  heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed be dumb hush thy screech lying raven exclaimed gryffyth his eyes darting tire and his slight form dilating  once priest and monk went before us to inspire not to daunt and our cry alleluia  was taught us by the saints ofthe church on the day when saxons fierce and many as harolds fell on the field of maesgarmon no the curse is on the head of the invader not on those who defend hearth and altar yea as the song to the bard the cursk leaps through my veins and rushes forth from my lips by the land they have ravaged by the gore they have spilt on these crags our last refuge below the earn on yon heights where the dead stir to hear mei launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of hengist they in turn shall know the steel of the strangertheir crown shall be shivered as glass and their nobles bc as slaves in the lund and the line of hengist and cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire and the ghosts of our fathers shall glide appeased over the grave of their nation but wewe though weak in the body in the soul shall be strong to the last the ploughshare may pass over our cities but the soil shall be trod by our steps and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards nor in the great judgement day shall any race but the race of cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth to answer for the sins of the brave so impressive the voice so grand the brow and sublime the wild gesture of the king as he thus spoke that not only the monk himself was awed  not only though he understood not the words did the norman knight bow his head as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloudbut even the sullen and widespreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment but the spearmen and multitude above excited by the tidings of safety to life and worn out by repeated defeat and the dread fear of famine too remote to hear the king were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators creeping from rank to rank and already they begun to sway and move and sweep slowly down towards the king recovering his surprise the norman again neared gryffyth and began to reurge his mission of peace but the chief waived him back sternly and said aloud though in saxon no secrets can pass between harold and me thus much alone take thou back as answeri thank the earl for myself my queen and my people noble have been his courtesies as foe as foe i thank himas king defy the torque he hath returned to my hand he shall see again ere the sun set messengers ye aro answered withdraw and speed fast that we may pass not your steps on the road the monk sighed and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there that the king was alone in his fierce defiance then lifting again the rood he turned away and with him went the norman the above and nearly all that belongs to it is inventionand very admirably invented it is we know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the catking as gryftyth is called by the norman his struggles his defeats and his suffering we venture to think that sir e b lytton w much mistaken when he represents not merely the clergy but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the confessor as well acquainted with the literature of greece and rome it is true that as regards abbots and monks he is in compensation very severe he does justice to such ecclesiastics as lanfranc and aclred but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of latinwhile a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior the following is a short part of their dialogue  the kings norman favourites at least honoured the church that is true said an abbot 4 and an it were not for two things i should love the norman better than the saxon what are they my father asked an aspiring young monk inprints quoth the abbot proud of the one latin word he thought he knew but that as we see was an error they cannot speak so as to be understood and i fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning here was a sanctified groancount william himself spoke to me in latin  continued the abbot raising his eyebrows did he wonderful  exclaimed several voices and what did you answer holy fathermarrysaid the abbot solemnly i replied inprinisgood said the young monk with a look of profound admiration we have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes even of gryftyth the catking of wales we are told that his mind had turned from the literature of rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land nnd other personages both saxon and norman refer to greek and latin authors with fur too much familiarity homeric fables and homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our anglosaxon forefathers than has by many been supposed yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from horace into the mouth of a young soldierstill more that he should employ such in conversation with a rude saxon from the weald of kent of course what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection  and whether it did or did not require to be translated in ad 1052 it is quite clear that sir e b lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in ad 1848for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into english whatever might be the case in england in the eleventh century wo are sure that greek was not studied in italy even in thc thirteenth centuryand that dante knew nothing of homer unless at secondhand in connexion with this matter we may here not unfitly notice the great number of saxon and anglosaxon words employed by sir e b lytton without explanation even where explanation seemed most necessary if the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of  harold to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors so much thc better  but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation in brackets or otherwise  provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant but generally we think he will be quite at a loss for the meaning we copy a fewand but a fewregarding which we are confident even welleducated persons will be at some loss weregeld lithtmen ceorl suhcendinen cyst mane uses dour cnehts quern  which with many more are of perpetual occurrence we say nothing of such words as thegn which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thaneor of zemmes which sir e b lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gemsbut we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment the author seems to have crammed himself from mr deyncourts folios as he admits in his prefatory epistleand then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others this is an ordinary error the great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out for this reason we tell him that northeast is not to suppose because he sees in a plan of london of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears and because the sport may be mentioned by fitzstephen that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century his mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting but not a very accurate description of london before the conquest in his first volume the truth is that we have no sufficient materials for such a description and on this account we are willing to take sir e b lyttons fanciful representation which is highly picturesque he is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources one instance to the contrary may however be pointed out near the end of his second volume where william then count or dukeof normandy challenges harold to bend his bowan exertion to which the saxon noble is not accustomed and which therefore he declines the meaning of bending a bow is not as sir e b lytton seems to imagine the pulling of a clothyard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung it is stringing a bow an operation requiring both art and strength and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful of the story itself we have said little because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in historyif history it deserve at that early date to be called the loves of harold and edith form but a small portion of the tale and as that is the most imaginative portion so iu several respects it is the best the character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn  and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by and contrasted with the more masculine proportions and appearance of hilda her magical and mysterious grandmotherwho from first to last acts a very prominent part in all that relates to harolds affection and to his ambition she is a very grand personage who adheres to the saxon faith rejecting the christian creed and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious it must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of norna in sir w scotts  pirate and of meg merrilies in his  guy mannering but it is only for a momentand in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author what follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and hilda are introduced in the second volume   there is no joy for me returned edith plaintively and i have that on my heart she added with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone  which at last i will dare to speak i reproach thee hilda that thou hast marred all my life that thou hast duped me with dreams and let me alone in despair speak on said hilda calmly as a nurse to a froward child hast thou not told me from the first dawn of my wondering reason that mv life and lot were interwoven withwith the word mad and daring must out with those of harold the peerless  but for that which my fancy took from thy lips as a law i had never been so vain and so frantic i had never watched each play of his face and treasured each word from his lips i had never made my life but a part of his lifeall my soul but the shadow of his sun but for that i had hailed the calm of the cloisterbut for that i had glided in peace to my grave and nownow o hilda edith paused and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command and she resumed quickly thou knowest that these hopes were but dreamsthat the law ever stood between him and meand that it was guilt to love him i knew the law answered hilda but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird ye are sibbe to each other some five times removed and therefore an old man at rome saith that ye ought not to wed when the shavelings obey the old man at rome and put aside their own wives and frillas and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl i will stoop to hear of their lawswith disrelish it may be but without scorn it is no sin to love harold and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together form and heart hilda hilda madden me not with joy cried edith starting up in rapturous emotion her young face dyed with blushes and all her renovated beauty so celestial that hilda herself was almost awed as if by the vision of freya the northern venus charmed by a spell from the halls of asgard  but that day is distant renewed the vaia what mattera what matters cried the pure child of nature i ask but hope enoughoh enough if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave  lo then said hilda behold the sunfthts dawns again as she spoke the vaia stretchy her arm and through the intersticed columns of th fane edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward presently into the space of the eire came harold her beloved his face was pale jjiv grief yet recent but perhaps more than everdiiajv was in his step and command on his brow for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of saxon england and what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soulthon comest said hilda in the hour i predicted atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star vak1 said harold gloomily  i will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements  or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture the earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of earl godwin and his four sons from banishment and the declaration by harold of his love for edithwho as we have seen stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him the incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volumeand the interest is powerfully wound up in the third they therefore who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied let them wait until they have finished the whole and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work it is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact such in a degree is the case with harold in various parts of that story he is not so much its hero as william duke of normandy the victor at hastings and sir e b lytton has drawn the character of william with such force and fullness that when ht and harold are together it is not to be disputed that william attracts more attention if not interest than his younger rival we do not say that the affections of the reader are not with harold but the genius the resources the mental power and subtlety of william engross our admirationand would make us feel certain even if we knew nothing historically of the issue that he must triumph we admit all along the courage and generosity of harold but as the author tells us his parts are comparatively slowand when in normandy he was outwitted and would have been more so hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew haco this may be true as history bot it is not right as artand here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel we cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped and who we know in the end will be conquered  iarold the last of the saxon kings in three volumes london bentley 1848 it is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work nor is it necessary so to do sir bulwver lytton is not a new aspirant after literary honours but as we had long since been given to understand that he had made his last appearance before the literary world the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited the present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit cast long back in our history the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the norman invasion and accordingly having done so he has rendered the subject completely his own and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history the auce was one fraught with interest as being the last hours of the old saxon mnonarchy the legend of harold and edith is related but differently to the received opinion concerning it and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public into whose hands such a work may naturally be expected to faul superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought about but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the narratives of these timesthey were believed in thought to have a part in every action of life so that unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our saxon forefathers no terror is sought to be inepired by these ghostly aids they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency the author has succeeded in portraying a very beautiful character in edith she is firm noble and affectionate loving wvith an unselfish love that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested not by basking in the enjoyment it affords butt where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine her love for harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake even though it brought her all she coveted on earththe desire to be near him harold is a very fine creation admirably sustained throughout we may on the whole pronounce harald to be one of the most striking of sir bulwer lyltons ever striking novels there is something highly classical in the style which tells at once of the bent of the atithors mind and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomed  harold the last ofthe saxon kinqa vy sir e bulwer lytton london bentley 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle sir edward flulwer lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement he also threatens us with a series of similar stories in which the earlier history of england is to be done into romance4 furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old english morals men and manners and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellowcountrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by professed historians and chroniclers a man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of pelhamn we can scarcely conceive that one who looks upon pelham as a gentleman upon the last days of pomopeii as a elaaical story and upon lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue should also look upon himself as brmed to somprobend the motie of th dark and the mediaeval ages is perhaps not a thing to create much surprise but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever if indeed the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of harold as we have found it ourselves we have small fear for the result if they smile with us at the authors pedantry at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader at the benevolence with which he translates a latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned at the hodgepodge of old phraseology and the style of the chroniclers intermingled with the true bulwerian sentiment and language at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of norman french saxon technicalities and names of common objects and cant ejaculations if they yawn with us over the authors tedious historical disquisitions over the ossianic raptures of hilda and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations and the literary references which thickly strew his pages if besides all this they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which with whatever personal weaknesses was the animating spirit of the confessorking we have little expectation that the world will petition sir edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history or to turn the events of our annals into a salmngundi of truth ard falsehood from all this our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of harold the last of the saxon kings a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of july in truth we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance but with little pleasure and no interest here and there indeed the story becomes more lively and brilliant and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author especially towards the terniination when sir edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist and writes like a man of common sense his tale becomes more readable and lifelike until all at once with the beginning of some new chapter the style of the modern novelist is laid aside and a foolish bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention we need scarcely say that sir e b lyttons ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect he writes as much nonsense about plriests and monks and relics and churchservices as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about jesuits and convents his portraits of such mien as king edward and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic the scene of the monarchs deathbed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity we ever were fated to read it will please and edify our readers to see sir edwards ideas as to how a christian king dies  the king lay for some moments silent but evidently striving to recollect his thoughts meanwhile the two arch prelates bent over him stigand eagerly alred fondly then raising himself on one arm while with the other he pointed to harold at the foot of the bed the king said  your hearts i see are with harold the earl so be it je loctroi at these words he fell back on his pillow a loud shriek burst from his wifes lips all crowded around he lay as the dead at the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall he made his way abruptly to the bedside and said chidingly  air give him air the throng parted the leech moistened the kings pale lips with the cordial but no breath seemed to come forth no pulse seemed to beat and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood the rest descended the dais and hatened to depart harold only remained but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed  the crowd had gained the centre of the hall when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstepthe sound of the kings voice loud terribly distinct and full as with the vigour of youth restored all turned their eyes appalled all stood spellbound there mate the king upright on the bed his face men above the kneeling prelates and his eyes bright and shining down the hail  yyu he odd dellberatelyi ea ts shall be a nl vision or a sale malon pant me almigbty one the power of speech to tell it he aused a

off be carried away yet move of itself to the ancient trunk unite to the stem bud out with the blossom and stretch forth its fruit so said the monks and even now ere i spoke i saw them again there standing mute and with the paleness of dead men by the side of my bed  these words were said so calmly and as it were so rationally that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone a shudder passed through the assembly and each man shrunk from the kings eye which seemed to each man to dwell on himself suddenly that eye altered in it cold beam suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent t the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect the whole face to work with horror the arms stretched forth the form writhed on the couch distorted fragments from the older testament rushed

steel and the flame lie boweth the mountains and comes down and darkness is under his feet v as if revived but for these tremendous denunciations as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed the eyes set and the king fell a corpse in the arms of harold in an earlier stage of the tale a similarly exquisite picture of the pious monarchs proceedings is given with all our authors felicity and truthtelling correctness veneration for the relics of saints is of course a fertile theme for ridicule throughout the story ania the poor king is painted as ready to sacrifice the lives and i appiness of living thousands for the sake of the bones of the deceased the efforts of the writer to show up the confessor as a drivelling child of superstition are indeed sufficient proof of his inadequacy to the task he has undertaken the following conversation between edward and harold is but one of a whole clas of passages  when the son of leofric had left the chamber the king rose wearily and said in

scene whihi followvs describing a saxon dinner of olden das  a monk of the order of st benedict then most in favour ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the abbot who after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek  ah guillaune he exclaimed in the norman tongue  this is indeed a grace for which to sing jubilate thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land ot illcooking and exile  talking of grace my dear father and food said de graville loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a waspfor even at that early 1eriod small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the french continent talking of grace the sooner thou savst it over some friendly refection the more will the latin sound unctuous and musical i have journeyed since daybreak and am now hungered and faint  alack alack cried the abbot plaintively  thou knowest little my son what hardships we endure in these parts how larded our larders and how nefarious our fare the flesh of swine salted  the flesh of beelzebub cried mallet de gravilte aghast  but comfort thee i have stores on my sumptermiulespoulardee and fishes and other not despicable comestibles and a few flasks of wine not pressed laud the saints  from the vines of this country wherefore wilt thou see to it and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer  no cooks have 1 to trust to replied the abbot  of cooking know they here as much as of latin natheless i will go and do my best with the stewpans meanwhile thou wilt at least have rest and the bath for the saxons even in their convents are a clean race and learned the bath from the dane  that i have noted said the knight  for even at the smallest house at which i have lodged in my way from london the host bath eourteonslv offered me the bath and the hostess linen curious and fragrant and to say truth the poor people are hospitable and

the time till the pomlardes be roasted and the fish broiled or stewed by the ablutions thou pfferaet me i shall tarry with thee some hours for i have much to learn  the abbot then led the sire de graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficientfor both norman and saxon hardy men as they seem to us from afar so shuddered at the touch of cold water that a bath of natural temperature as well as a hard bed was sometimes imposed as a penancethe good father went his way to examine the sumptermules and admonish the muchsuffering and bewildered laybrother who officiated as cookand who speaking neither norman nor latin scarce made out one word in ten of his superiors elaborate exhortations  mallets squire with a change of raiment and goodly coffers of soaps unguents and odours took his way to the knight for a norman of birth was accustomed to much per sonal attendance and had all respect for the body and it was nearly an hour before in a long gown of fur reshaven dainty and decked the sire de graville bowed and sighed and prayed before the refection set out in the abbots cell so the two normans despite the sharp appetite of the lay man ate with great gravity and decorum drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination sel dom more than tasting with looks of patient

in the air to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert as if recalling the polished manners of normandy still retained in that desolate exile and their temperate meal thus concluded dishes wines and attendants vanished and their talk commenced such another is the story of a contest in feats of strength and skill between duke william and harold when the latter went to normandy to claim the restoration of his kinsmen who had been hostages in williams hands  one day as during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging the normans were diverting their leisure with martial games in which taillefer shone preeminent while harold and william stood without their tent watching the animated field the duke abruptly exclaimed to mallet de graville  bring me my bow now harold let me see if thou canst bend it the bow was brought and saxon and norman gathered round the spot i fasten thy glove to yonder tree mallet said the duke taking that mighty bow in his hand and carefully feeling the string then he drew the arc to his ear and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock as the shaft piercing the glove lodged half way in the trunk i such are not our weapons said the earl  and ill would it become me unpractised so to peril our english ho nour as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow but that i may show these norman knights that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer bring me forth godrith my shield and my danish axe taking the shield and axe which the saxon brought to him haiold then stationed himself before the tree  now fair duke said he smiling i choose thou thy longest shaftbid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows round this tree will i move and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body i leave unguarded by my shield i no said william hastily  that were murder i it is but the common peril of war said harold simply and he walked to the tree i the blood mounted to williams brow and the lions thirst of carnage parched his throat  an he will have it so said he beckoning to his archers  let not normandy be shamed watch well and let every shaft go home avoid only the head and the heart such orgulous vaunting is best cured by bloodletting the archers nodded and took their post each at a separate quarter and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the earl for as he moved though he kept his back guarded by the tree some parts of his form the shield left exposed and it would have been impossible in his quickshifting movements for the archers so to aim as to wound but to spare life yet the earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye calmly bright even at the distance all the shafts of the archers at one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each that three fell to the ground blunted against it and two broke on its surface but william waiting for the first discharge and seeing full mark at harolds shoulder as the buckler turned now sent forth his terrible shaft the noble taillefer with a poets true sympathy cried i saxon beware but the watchful saxon needed not the warning as it in disdain harold met not the shaft with his sild but swinging high the mighty axe which with most men required both arms to wield it he advanced a step and clove the rushing arrow in twain  before williams loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield on the whole we should say that harold is an utter failure sir edward lytton is not the man for the task he has not a breath of the spirit of the middle ages within his breast and thus writes at haphazard when he would expound the motives and feelings of the personages of his story he sees nothing of their characters and conduct but a few external peculiarities unlike any thing that ever came across his own limited experience and associated in his mind with ideas with which they hand no real connexion whatsoever he has also adopted a foolsb medley of styles of composition which destroys the readableness ot his book as much as its incorrectness destroys its historical utility the result is that harold is about as much a picture of anglosaxon and norman times as lord eglintouns gimcrack tournament was a revival of the genuine sports of antique days added to this sir edward has been so worried by the critics of the press for the immoral tendencies of his previously publishied novel lucretia that he has determined to make harold a terribly moral  book and bhas converted the connexion between the saxon king and edith into a pure sentimental affection anmd this by way of historical accuracy  rzctxor iihrold the last of thie saxon kin lrs b3y sir e if lo rron hart in 3 vols ljondon 184s bentley iiaving received from sir e buser lytton a very polite note stating that he had requested his publisher to send us a copy of his harold for review wc should have felt some surprise that it had not reached ius hut that the same thing has occtirrcd in some halfdozen other instances proving that it is not an accidental neglect but the result of that unaccountable and strangely implacable hostility which tiie critic has from the beginning until now encountered from two or three publishers who have no cause that we are aware of for their enmity as we are not consciotus of having dealt with other than the most perfect fairness with any book to which their names have been appended luring the five years tniz critic has been fulfilling the duties of a literary journal that their hostility unkind and uncalled for as it is has not in any way affected our conduct towards them every reader can bear testimony for still have the hooks they publish received the same impartial notice and filled the same prominent kakce in our columns as if they had extended to us the same courtesy as they show to our other literary journal and as other publishers show to this although compelled to borrow their looks from circulating libraries they have not been either neglected or unjustly treated in our columns nor even if the same hostility be continued unmitigated will any different rule govern our conduct for the future we notice the fact now only because the present instance is a remarkable one and to account to the author and to our readers for a brevity of notice compelled by the inconvenient circumstances under which this review is written harold differs materially from any other of sir e b lyttons fictions it is in its design an epic and in its composition a chronicle the author has successfully endeavoured to combine the unity of the one with the individuality of the other the period chosen is peculiarly adapted for an epic whether in prose or in poetry the catastrophe is a great historical event gradually evolved out of the incidents that occupy the narrative the interest rises with every chapter and at the close becomes intense but sir e b lytrton has in this romance attempted much more than merely an attractive story he has sought to embody history to present an accurate as well as a vivid and lifelike picture of the times to realise them as it were to his readers imagination and to his own hence harold is something more than a sofabook it is a work for the study and might worthily take its place upon the historical shelf in the library so careful has been the author to preserve the strictest accuracy in the appointments of his romance that he has adduced at the bottom of the page the authorities from which his information is taken so laborious a work may not please the mere novelreader so much as a flimsy creation of the fancy but it will be more valued by those whose approval is most valuable and will secure for it a more lasting existence as it is a book which wvill be read by every body we will not attempt to anticipate their enjoyment by any account of the plot suffice it to observe that britons saxons normans and northmen are introduced with their several distinctive characteristics giving immense variety to the picture and that harold is sketched with a mastery of minute traits of character gradually developed which the author has not sur passed if lie has equalled in any former fiction we present one specimen only the death of edward the confessor the king who had already undergone the last holy offices of the church was lying quite quiet his eyes half closed breathing low

shepherd to thy bereaven flock  whom shall we admonish to tread in those traces thy footsteps leave below  the king made a slight gesture of impatience and the queen forgetful of all but her womanly sorrow raised her eye and finger in reproof that the dying was thus disturbed but the stake was too weighty the suspense too keen for that reverent delicacy in those around and the thegns pressed on each other and a murmur rose which murmured the name of harold  bethink thee my son said aired in a tender voice tremulous with emotion  the young atheling is too much an infant yet for these anxious times edward signed his head in assent  then said the norman bishop of london who till that moment had stood in the rear almost forgotten amongst the crowd of saxon prelates but who himself had been

B4261,['4995976'],  fiction i the woodman a romance of the times of i i richard iii by g p ir james esq i author of a darnley c in 3 vols london newby 1849 mr james is inexhaustible and he is as facile in composition as he is fertile in invention another historical romance is to be added to the catalogue of his fictions that he continues to write and the public to read is proof of great capacities although he must needs draw somewhat more from memory and less from invention than at the beginning of his career of authorship if it be impossible that he can altogether avoid mannerism by which we mean the copying of himself yet it must be admitted that this his latest work shows no symptoms of exhausted fancy or overlaboured faculties the cause of this is the profound knowledge of the history of the middle ages its men manners and habits which has secured for his long series of historical novels an interest apart altogether from story or portrait to read a romance of his is to read the history of the times of which he treats only in a somewhat more lively and truthful and impressive form we have the result of his studies put into a pleasing picture which is readily remembered his personages may be real or ideal but when he does attempt to draw areal character itiselaborated withcare and history and memoir are consulted for traits which should as it were restore the dead for the benefit of the living perhaps as fine a theme for the novelist as any to be found in history is the character of rioad the third and the men and manners of his time the author is however subjected to the disadvantage of a comparison with the portraiture of shakspfer so great is the influence unconsciously exercised over us by the dramatist that our notions of the crookbacked tyrant are formed from the pa and not from history and any departure froml the main features of that representation is likely to be received with disapprobation by the reader as a violation not of truth only but of propriety mr james has boldly dared to introduce richard the third as not quite the fiend tradition and s1iak5pxri have made him and eonsequently more in accordance with such authentic memorials of him as have been reserved and which in the hands of modern historians have thrown a new light upon his character and career ilence a work which is more valuable more useful and likely to be of longer life than if it had been a mere romance to be read for its story and then thrown aside and forgotten mr james has produced a very perfect historical tableau in persons in costumes in scenery and accessories and we suspect that a much more accurate conception of the time of which he treats may be formed by a careful investigation of this romance than from any of our regular histories and even as a mere narrative it is one of his best and will profoundly interest those who care little for the profit to be derived from its perusal the plot is admirably constructed and ingeniously sustained and evolved the incidents are well imagined and the composition has more of the authors pictorial power than we have seen in any of his later productions lie has abbreviated his dialogues anl avoided that minuteness of inventory which was usually complained of by readers who were not possessed with a passion for antiquities we will not further describe the plot because the work will of course be found in every circulating library and be read by all who read novels and by many who do not confess to be readers of them it would mar much of their pleasure in the perusal to inform them here what is cointing so we content ourselves with a few extracts which will rather tempt to further acquaintance with the volumes than anticipate them the reader will probably be surprised to find richard described as a man having some tender feelings as in this masterly scene between himself and queen anne on receiving the news of the death of prince edward the instant she heard her husbands step she turned quickly round with a timid and inquiring glance but riclhard was in one of his milder moods the subject of his thought aid hers was one of common affection and lie advanced tenderly towards her and took her in his arms saying 1 have heard nothing ann but cast these fears from your mind i trust that this is nothing but one of those sicknvsses of childhood which come and pass away like spring showers the tears came into the queens eyes rising from very mingled emotions her apprehension for her child her husbands tenderness the feeling perhaps of her own

somewhat closer to him he said well well wipe away your tears love if we hear not better tidings today thou shalt go to mliddleham and i will go with thee  thanks my gracious lord thanks replied the

B3189,['3169911'],  the reds of the midi here is a historical novel such as we get only once in a very long time and in a translation so good as to balmost as much a rarity the author is a very distinguished provenalmy information i may as well confess is derived entirely from the prefacewho is at this moment capouliw that is official head of the fulibrige the society of provensal men of letters being second in succession to mistral he has written epics and lyrics and stories in prose and conspicuous among these wst is this tale of the march of the marseilles battalion to paris it is a very remarkable work it is literaturewhich not one such story in a thousand contrives to be but just because historical romance is fashionable now i should recommend it with a warning to those who read mr stanley weyman and his entertaining brothers and imitators in england it is not a budoir version of a rough chapter out of a rough and terrible time it is very real and very ungenteel the marseilles men did not fight in kid gloves nor save when they were shouting their songs or their stereotyped cries did they utter fine sentiments no one at all in this story is told gff to speak words of horror or deprecation or to adjust the balance so as to be quite fair all round it is made up of the recollections of a rude untaught peasant boy that marched with the battalion who had no theories but sang the marsellaise with greater faith than he had ever sung a litany no philosophy of any kind blurred what he actually saw his story is a peasants story and told to peasants there is a good deal to find fault with the incidents relating to the marquis dambrun and his family and surto and l jacarasse seem like a hallucination and that the wretches should stifler death by the very guillotine on which the child they had plotted to kill had innocently written her name is a straining after an artificial effect which is below the level of the rest but indeed the story does not much concern a reader though the characters do little pascalet margan and samat with his banner of the rights of man and his goodhumoured intolerance of anybody who would not applaud and look cheerful at

once it is men of the midi you have to do with all that long weary trudge to paris with momentary intervals of depression their tongues and their throats are making a deafening din with the carmagnole or their own hymn the exuberance of their spirits produces every appearance of disorder they are chattering excitable children the vitality of a northerner would have given out long before in mere waste emotion but these had enough and to spare there was method in their madness they reached paris and tired of waiting for the word of attack from the finnicking timid townsfolk they gave the word themselves that lost louis xvi his crown pascalet is a type of them lie is in despair about his extreme youth and will convince the whole world by his tremendous exertions that he is as good a man as any he smears his maiden chin with blackberries insists on being harnessed to the cannon that he may enter vienne with honour and dragging with might and main is delighted when a girl cries out  just look at that young fellow goodness how he frightens me  he thunders out big oaths with ostentation and never a single grumble in the fighting in paris he is both frightened and plucky he dances with joy when he finds a joint of his finger shot away and plays the fool and the man and the child all at once wvhat military excitement means to an eager boy bred in obscurity will probably never be better described but as i have maid the paris scenes are not for squeamish reader who will be shocked to find no words of protest from the simple men who having walked hundreds and hundreds of hungry miles to do a thing had done it and had faith they were right though they found that the advent of liberty meant unloosing a good many devils from hell there is one striking passage in the book

B729,['8771387'],  norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale

sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much

bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a

messrs kingsleycharles and henry both affectthe former may claim the honour of having inventedwhat is called  muscular christianity in both the ideal of goodness is intimately associated with a sound

entirely to the sterner sexto be dyspeptic is difficult to be  larmoyant would be impossible the characteristics are utterly incongruous charity indeed forbids them to lay down as a broad principle that no true christian can be subject to neuralgia or afraid of bronchitis or weak on his pins or less than four feet ten inches in stature or too feeble to fight the blacksmith and too timid to shoot a robber but the best that can be said for suchjfrail brethren is that appearances are strongly against them according to the kingsley theory the perfect christian should be recognizable if exhumed a thousand years hence by some theological cuvier of the thirtieth century by the size of his skeleton and the magnificent expansion of his os frontis living in our own day this species may be known chiefly by their vigorous vitality their endurance of fatigue the inextinguishable laughter with which they greet every crisis of suffering or adversity and the stalwart strength1 which upon adequate provocation they can impart to the extensor muscles of the forearm written upon these principles the romances of either kingsley are full of excitement and interest their heroes are apt to display all manner of feats of personal prowess and of course find innumerable opportunities for such performances the author of  geoffrey hamlyna younger brother we believe of the rector of eldertonnow makes his first appearance as the writer of an independent work hitherto his productions have been limited to a few u spirited  articles in frasers magazine describing the sporting capabilities of australia his present work relates chiefly to the same country with which mr h kingsley is evidently well acquainted and concerning which he has much that is at once novel and interesting to tell the family theory indeed prospers amazingly by emigration to a new country in our old and hotpressed society at home we are forced to confess that  muscular christianity  is somewhat out of place it is not altogether true and might occasionally be found inconvenient a muscular christian of the kingsley type would sometimes under contingencies that must now and then occur in england find himself entangled in rather disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by

exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the

people will do well to read signor silones novel the book has been banned in italy it is almost becoming a canon of criticism that modem dictatorships cannot stand good books and that good writers cannot stand dictators fontamara is an exceedingly good book it describes how a remote  semisavage  italian village living as it has for generations on the starvation line is brought into contact with fascism and is systematically robbed of its means of living by the upstart fascist contractors the story is told with calculated and cunning simplicity by the peasants themselves with faintly satirical wonder with a sly feigning of incomprehension of the intent of their persecutors and with a simple but blasting humour faced by this inscrutable childlike quality and malice of the peasants the fascists can do nothing else but beat them up and kill them which they do this is a very moving and very subtle book purged of hatred but quite dear in its purpose its didactic purpose is web assimilated if it is not invisible the story is an object lesson to those novelists who are preoccupied with the social crisis of our time but who are overwrought about their material the book

fire and sword  was reviewed in the columns of this journal 4 the deluge  forms the second and we hope messrs dent will give us the third 4 pan michael sienkiewicz appears to have led a wandering life and was for some years in america but resides we believe at present in warsaw like count tolstoi he loves to put a great many figures on his canvas which is crowded with pictures of battle and adventure he contrives also to introduce the leading historical personages of the period and following the example of the late anthony trollope carries some of his imaginary characters through a whole series of novels thus in 4the deluge we have the reappearance of pan zagloba a thoroughly falstaflian individual whose adventures are legion and his bombast and selflaudation inexhaustible the history of poland is so little studied in this country that the facts upon which the novel is based will be familiar to few we must therefore go a little into detail the period of 4 the deluge  is that of the reign of john casimir in which poland suffered from all the ills of foreign and civil war an amiable but weak man he ascended the throne in 1649 and married his brothers widow marie louise a woman of beauty and spirit in his reign the swedes invaded the country and took both cracow and warsaw and he was obliged to fly into silesia their success would not have been so great had not the entranceinto the country been made easy by the treachery of opalinski the palatine of posen and radziwill the hetman of lithuania karl gustav the swedish king meditated parcelling out the country giving portions to the elector of brandenburg the hetman and others but the swedes were driven out polands hour had not yet come in 1668 john casimir abdicated all these characters figure in the picturesque pages of m sienkiewicz opalinski who wrote some venomous satires on the universal corruption of mankind is brought before us with all his odious characteristics radziwill appears as the evil spirit of the story and dies in great suffering he is portrayed as a gloomy ambitious man and is made additionally odious on account of his calvinism which stands in strong relief to the fanatical roman catholicism of his countrymen the hero is a gallant young polish noble who is desperately in love with a charming girl panna alexandra or in its pretty abridged form olenka he is induced at first to take the side of radziwill but when ho discovers that he is a traitor he deserts the cause of the powerful hetman it is this change of front that gets him into trouble after hairbreadth escapes he contrives to make his way to the king in silesia his devotion to the cause of john casimir is profound he distinguishes himself in many engagements and finally receives the hand of the young lady of whom he is enamoured olenka meanwhile has not been without her perils but we will not forestall their interest there is no lack of vigour in the authors style but the bloodshed may pall upon the gentle reader in the words of byrons criticism on dr polidoris tragedy all stab and everybody dies these nobles as represented by m sienkiewicz are certainly brutal enough in spite of their occasional airs of chivalry as for the wretched peasantry they seem only to exist to be pillaged turned into soldiers and killed by the rival factions we have old poland before us in the pages of our novelist and a sad country it is at best m sienkiewicz puts additional colour into his picture by his accounts of the swedes and their armies many scotchmen also figure here we almost wonder that he did not include the renowned patrick gordon afterwards the friend of peter the great this fine specimen of the scotch younger son and mercenary soldier of the period has told us in his diary how being frequently taken prisoner he passed from one party to the other now fighting with the swedes and now with the poles it only remains in conclusion to say some words on mr curtins translation he has long since won his spurs as a worker in slavonic fields he is accurate almost to baldness and we think that on many occasions he might have given a footnote for we cannot imagine what the english reader will think of some of the expressions left unexplained eg the snitch to adopt the translators spelling so also to interpret the polish for constantinople as the city of the tsar cargrad is rather confusing it would have been better to say the city of the caesars the many americanisms are of course in the natural order of things whatever our translator gains in accuracy by his phonetic spelling of polish names he seems to lose in the hideous form which he communicates to all the native words we do not think our polish friends can possibly be pleased with these transformations he might by the way have given tylsa its

monarch and his court at versailles in its decadence mesdames de amontespan and de maintenon the fallen and the rising stars a few stock personages such as bossuet louvois peer la chaise for the other still less and so far good the scantiness of the detail is all in favour of imagination having free play but unfortunately his imagination has failed him in the historical chapters of the novel and louis bossuet racine corneille the less madame de maintenon and the others are dwarfed and stiffened out of life their characteristic speeches have the effect of labels fastened on to help in their identification no doubt louis said or adopted the famous  letat cest moi but that is an excellent reason why a novelist who wishes to make the king act his part to the life should be chary of putting the actual words into his mouth madame de maintenon is made to overdo the rdle of virtue and is represented as an unattractive schoolmarm many will wish the scene with corneille had been omitted it is there to no purpose and though it is only thomas still there was enough family likeness between him and the proudest the most uncourtierlike of poets to make the fawning improbable even his recent election to the academy could hardly have reduced him to such a reptile condition if thomas corneille ever was actor in such a scene it might have remained unrecorded here but the historical part should not be taken too seriously after all it is the unhistorical huguenot refugees de catinat the gallant frenchman and his brave adele with amos green the stalwart young hero from the maine forests that we are meant to be interested in and as mr conan doyle can always tell a story their adventures are really entertaining in the little craft of ephraim savage the pious new englander they escape

the ordeal of inventing dialogues in which bossuet fonelon corneille conde and louvois are all conscientiously introduced his prodigious young new englander amos green is worth all the portraits of

B7529,['4699031'],  the linwoods or sixty years since in america by miss sedg wick churton holles street although the authoress of  hopeleslie  redwood and  the linwoods does not as a novelist possess the untiring activity of cooper the broad humour of paulding or such sudden bursts of keen vivacious satire as emitted by mrs trollope yet she is held by the transatlantic public with great justice in higher esteem than her american literary competitors her novels are imbued with an irresistible charm the charm of truth and by consequence its neverfailing companionthat of sympathy without the superfine metaphysical process of minutely scrutinising and portraying the secret mechanism the various movements and phases of the human heart miss sedgwick exhibits at once and without seeming effort the  open secret of our affections and impulses in a manner so quietthough not the less unerringas must engage the sympathies of every reader be they ever so homely moreover her characters are evidently not the creations of imagination but actual studies from the great life academy of nature we find in the novel before us no exaggerations of fact in no one instance a departure from probability but an easy calm and no less interesting flow of events presenting a more healthy nay greater source of excitement to the  reading public than the sudden transitions or  remarkable events  embodied by the great  wizard of the north himself the title of the book  sixty years since immediately refers its readers to the commencement of the american struggle for independencea retrospect peculiarly favourable to the novelist and of which the authoress of the linwoods has availed herself judiciously and effectively we shall present our readers with an extract affording a peculiarly favourable specimen of the description of talent we have given miss sedgwick credit for as also one of the easy unobtrusive humour she possesses it describes the parting of eliot lee from his family his village friends and the home of his childhood on starting to volunteer in the cause of his country  a fine black saddlehorse well equipped was at the door little fanny lee stood by him patting him and laying her head with its shining flaxen locks to his side  rover she said with a trembling voice be a good roverwont you  and when the naughty regulars come canter off with eliot as fast as you can  hey thats fine   retorted her brother a year younger than herself no no rover canter up to them and over them and never dare to canter back here if you turn tail on them rover oh sam how awful would you have eliot killed no indeed but i had rather hed come deused near it than to have him a coward  dont talk so loud sambessie will hear you but the young belligerent was not to be silenced he threw open the dwellingroom door to appeal to eliot himself the halfuttered sentence died away on his lips he entered the apartment fanny followed they gently closed the door drew their footstools to eliots feet and quietly sat down there how instinctive is the sympathy of children how plain and yet how delicate its manifestations  bessie was sitting beside her brother her head on his shoulder and crying as if her heart went out with every sob the youngest boy hal sat on eliots knee with one arm around his neck his cheek lying on bessies dropping tear after tear sighing and halfwondering why it was so  the good mother had arrived at that age when grief rather congeals the spirit than melts it her lips were compressed her eyes tearless and her movements tremulous she was busying herself in the last offices doing up parcels taking last stitches and performing those services that seem to have been assigned to women as safetyvalves for their effervescing feelings  a neat table was spread with ham bread sweetmeats cakes and every delicacy the house affordedall were untasted not a word wvas heard except such broken sentences as  come bessie i will promise to be good if you will to be

wellmeaning but untimely visitors eliots approaching departure had created a sensation in westbrook tle good people of that rustic place not having arrived at the refined stage in the progress of society when emotion and fellowfeeling are not expressed or expressed only by certain conventional forms first entered master hale with miss sally ryal master hale  hoped it was no intru sion and miss sally answered by no means she had come to lend a helping hand and not to intrude whereupon she bustled about helped herself and her companion to chairs and unsettled every body else in the room mrs lee assumed a more tranquil mien poor bessie suppressed her sobs and withdrew to a window and eliot tried to look composed and manly the children like springs relieved from a pressure reverted to their natural state dashed off their tears and began whispering among themselves miss sally produced from her workbag a comforter for mr eliot of her own knitting which she  trusted would keep out the cold and rheumatism  and she was kindly showing him how to adjust it when she spied a chain of braided hair around his neck ah ha mr eliot a love token she exclaimed   yes it is said little fanny who was watching her proceedings bessie and i cut locks of hair from all the childrens heads and mothers and braided it for him and i guess it will warm his bosom more than your comforter will miss sally  it was evident from the look of ineffable tenderness eliot turned or fanny that he  guessed so too but he nevertheless received the comforter graciously hinting that a lady who had been able to protect her own bosom from the most subtle enemy must know how to defend anothers from common assaults miss sally hemmed looked at master hale muttered something of her not always having been invulnerable and finally succeeded in recalling to eliots recollection a tradition of a lovepassage between miss sally and the pedagogue  a little girl now came trotting in with  grandmothers love and a phial of her mixture for mr eliotgood against campdistemper and the like  eliot received the mixture as if he had all grandmothers faith in it slipped a bright shilling into the childs hand for a

shoulder said  this is you my boy this is what i wanted to see your fathers son adoing id go too if the rascals had left me both my legs cheer up widow and thank the lord youve got such a son to offer up to your countrythe richer the gift the better the giver you know but i dont wonder you feel kind o qualmish at the thoughts of losing the lad come master hale cant you say something a little bit of greek or latin or most any thing to keep up their perits at the last gasp as it were  i was just going to observe major avery to mrs lee respecting our esteemed young friend mr eliot that 1 who have known him from the beginning as it were having taught him his alphabet which may be said to be the first round of the ladder of learning which he has mounted by my help or rather if you will allow me maam to mend my figure the poles that support all the rounds having had as i observed a primordial acquaintance with him i can testify that he is worthy every honourable adjective in the language and we have every reason to hope that his future tense will be as perfect as his past  wheugh   exclaimed the major  a pretty long march you have had through that speech   the good schoolmaster quite unruffled proceeded to offer eliot a timeworn virgil and finished by expressing his hopes that  he would imitate caesar in maintaining his studies in the camp and keep the scholar evenhanded with the soldier  eliot charmed the old pedagogue by assuring him that he should be more apt at imitating caesars studies than his soldiership and himself bestowed virgil in his portmanteau of a good lady now stepped forth and seeming somewhat scandalised that as she said  no serious truth had been spoken at this peculiar season she concluded a technical exhortation by giving eliot a pair of stockings into which she had wrought st pauls description of the gospel armour the scripture she feared did not often find its way to the camp and she thought a passage might be blessed as a single kernel of wheat even sowed among tares sometimes produced its like  eliot thanked her and said  it was impossible to have too much of the best thing in the world but he hoped she would have less solicitude about him when he assured her that his mother had found place for a pocket bible in his portmanteau  a meeklooking creature now stole up to mrs lee and putting a roll of closelycompressed lint into her hand said  tuck it in with his things miss lee dont let it scare youi trust he will dress other peoples wounds not his own with itmy that will come natural to him its made from the shirt mr eliot stripped from himself and tore into bandages for my poor sam that time he was scalt mr eliot was a boy then but he has the same heart now  mrs lee dropped a tear on the lint as she stowed it away in the closelypacked portmanteau we cannot resist quoting an anecdote of the hero of the above cleverly depicted scene related of him during his introductory visit to general washidgton it is amusing and

of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact

gryphon  and enthusiastic specials who skim the surface of the land in a cool season are indeed prone to break into glowing periods concerning the gorgeous east but the effect produced upon the european character by any prolonged residence in the most picturesque and at the same time the most humourous country in the world would appear to be almost invariably commonplaceness and unalterable gravity the reason is not of course difficult to discover there are awkward practical qualities underlying indian picturesqueness and indian absurdity which tend to detract from their charm with though national prepossession in favour of the more solid virtues it is difficult for the average englishman to retain any delight in the flowery jungle or the fairylike grotesqueness of though native bazaar when he has learned that the one means lurking snakes and poisonous miasmas and the other any number of grave offences against salubrity in the same way he ceases to be attracted by patriarchal habits and romantic beliefs when he finds that these by no means indicate the manly qualities of energy and uprightness but after all it is a part of the englishmans philistinism his meiitorious philistinism no doubt but philistinism notwithstanding to dislike or despise the romance of india because of her deficient respectability this deficiency is not to be denied  as far as thc respectable virtues go india has some cause to feel ashamed but her shortcomings here are after all but negatiae qualities thc result of applying to her a foreign standard the positive quality the distinguishing fact about herself and her people is not respectability nor the lack of respectability but romance she is only to be seen truthfully and interpreted justly when looked at from the romantic viewpoint so that it is really to le regretted that just those people who know most about ber refuse either to see or to paint her for us under this her most lovable and vital aspect mr allardyce ave hasten to say forms a brilliant exception to though rule evidently he is under no illusions himself as to the character of the mild hindoo ho does not attempt to attribute to him any of the heroic virtues nor does he represent india after though manner of the gushing special as a paradise of luxuriant splendour he is content to paint her as he finds her as imagination and experience have shoavn her to himwith all her faults and aveakness her unreliability caprices and deceits but at the same time with all her dreamy fascination  her grace her pathetic tenderness above all her poetry which hides a multitude of sins the  city of sunshine as its description stands in our novel will do for the picture of almost any bengal village of tolerable size there is the picturesque little temple under the fluttering peepnltree though dilapidated but imposinglooking mansion of the poor native nobleman of the place  the tawdry stucco dwelling of the rich mabajan or moneylender  and then the street of quaint little open shops either linc broken here and there by high brick avails oaershadowed by largeleaved plantains mr allardyce is sufficient artist to people his little world with none save living and typical men and av omen ave have no layfigures no ghosts to fill up empty niches and corners all bis characters from ram la ll the greedy oilman to gangooly the simple garrulous headman of thc village  from kristo lahory the proud and poor brabmau to three shells the moneylender and arillain of the story are true not only to life bnt to natiate life the reader may learn as much from studying even this little side group of secondary personages as from spending many hours in the actual dust and heat and bustle of an indian bazaar but there are two studies of a much higher dramatic order testifying not only to the authors exceptional grasp of the shades and colour of character but also of his clear sense of the very questionable improvement for moral worth or personal happiness to bo effected by encouraging young india to make one mouthful of all european intellectualism much after the manner that the ancestral sage vasistha swalloaaed the thunderbolt of brahma  with much the samo results alsoof sore inward burnings and outward vomitings of smoke inasmuch as the noble human spirit or thc spirit which just falls short of being noble is always a higher matter of study

of his upper garment in mute per pexify as to what he should do with this awkward arrival we must of course let mr allardyce himself unfold the intricacy and detail of krishnas descent from the high moral position of a national reformer to the easy tolerance of a cultured hindoo whoso favourite maxim is that  there is no creed so bad but it may serve to comfort some poor soul but the reader may take our word for it that though krishnas course may be considered by some a doavnward one he never fails to carry with him our sympathy and interest another excellent lifepicture is mr eversley the

henry nortiecote broke of covenden constable 19068 perhaps if we knew the exact dates on which the above books were severally written we should find the duality of the author less perplexing by virtue of three books published by messrs constable a year or two ago mr snaith ranks with messrs wells conrad bennett and galsworthy as the fifth great novelist of our age his other books are amusing clever wellwritten wellcomposedall thats merry and bright and they bear about the same relation to literature as mr rackhams illustrations do to art araminta is the best of themthe style is pretty and the idea graceful but the work is too superficial to pass for comedy it has not the touch of merediths short stories mrs fitz again has its good scenesthe naughtiness of the king of illyria is delightfulbut the book is an obvious potboiler the character of sir richard pendragon in fortunt is whimsical and stirring but even in this very jolly book it is obvious that mr snaith does not take himself seriously as a writer of romance he does not approach his work with the imperturbable seriousness of dumas or stevenson his romances are as void of any undercurrent of thought or passion as those of cutcliffe hyne or conan doyle ingenuity seeks in vain for one fiery outburst from the author of william 7ordan for one surpassing phrase to electrify this pleasant business of love and adventure knights and highwaymen it is hard to believe that the same pen that wrote such commonplace as mistress dorothy alarvin has given us two immortal descriptions of heroes who denied the world to save their genius what of it  it is enough for one lifetime to have produced broke of covinden henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior of these books the first alone has achieved any measure of success or fame it is the earliest worst written and least important yet it has fine comedy and profound tragedy the influence of meredith is very apparent in the picture of broke a more rigid more passionate stupider sir willoughby patterne in one passage an invocation to the audience at the olympian theatre the author lapses into a travesty of merediths very style the tutor one of natures gentlemen and gods poets who rescues the youngest most intelligent and least ugly of brokes six daughters from the horrors of a manage de cowenance is closely modelled on vernon whitford all this detracts a little from the excellence of the book and certain abominations of style which have also to be mentioned detract from it still more take for instance this sentence  a gallant but intrepid hound who took a somewhat informal departure from this life because he chose to cross a railway when hounds were in full cry at the moment the express from london had chosen to cross it also this is terrible we hear too of  a game rejoicing in the euphonious name of pingpong and of  that mysterious zoological specimen the consummate ass dickens himself never committed worse excesses than these in the way of cheap irony and we may add that mr snaith would be well advised to go through all his books and scratch out the word  somewhat  wherever it occurs nevertheless there is grandeur in the scheme of broke of covenden it is thrilling to read how blow upon blow fell upon the all but indomitable pride of the hero and not till the end will lie vield and the characters are more vivid more passionate than merediths meredith would never have shown us the fire in delias soul admirable too is uncle charles a bibulous and kindhearted nobleman beloved by everyone but his wife a literary lady who writes for the spectator whose character the author draws with more ferocity than finesse in a humorous chapter this insufferable dame is smacked by her longsuffering husband alas that the author should add  not in the authentic place  broke of covenden may then be classed as a fine book but imitative henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior resemble nothing but each other written in a style of fantastic beauty they both describe the soul of genius battling to keep its purity untainted in the material world they are spiritual tragedies already in broke of covenden the author is apt to make his characters speak not as they would have spoken but rather as their souls would have spoken already in the description of brokes final desolation we have a foretaste of the authors power of expressing the psychical  there were occasional fierce gushes of rain driven by the wind against the windowpanes of the cottage he mistook them for waves of blood breaking over the walls of his mind in the two later books the whole atmosphere is spiritual the real things are the things of the soul and the phenomenal world becomes a hideous and obscuring dream henry northcote is an advocate penniless and unknown in the prelude a dying and destitute stranger who has heard his oratory in hyde park comes to visit him they talk together about jesus and the need of a new failure a great renunciator like him  to restore the sense of illusion and to show that the strife for the perfect is not a chimaera of the madhouse the stranger vanishes and the same night northcote is given his chance he is to defend a prostitute from a charge of murder the case seems as hopeless as it is sordid the woman is guilty beyond all doubt but to northcote it seems an unholy thing that a woman should be hanged he exerts his amazing genius and procures a verdict of  not guilty the trial scene is dramatic and northcotes speech with its vision of an ideal jury and christ as foreman is great literature but northcote realises that he has worked not for his ideal but for himself his ideal self dies and the ideal self of the woman he has rescued perishes at the same time we leave him an incendiary and a murderer established on the road to worldly success the grim story is relieved by passages of a peculiar humour a humour that reminds one now of dickens now of baudelaires poemes en prose and like the book itself baffles all description hard as it is to give an account of henry northcote in a few lines it is harder still to suggest the characteristics of william 7ordan 7unior judged by the standard of the souls grand effort towards perfection henry northcote the advocate fails and william jordan junior the poet succeeds despite imprisonment poverty sickness and ridicule air snaith is perhaps the only writer of prose who has understood the poetic character his prose in its faults and merits is a poets prose throughout and the character of his poet must be founded on some mighty experience the frail boy is brought up by his aged father in a little bookshop he lives with the heroes of the iliad in a world of poetry and dreams he is terrified of the  streetpeople and as unfit for school or business as a fairy yet gifted with dauntless resolution he lives down his terrors one by one and does not die till he has written the poem it was his mission on earth to write there is nothing in literature like this story of a sublime spirit imprisoned in a wasting frame even the humour is unique who can ever forget the conversation of mr octavius crumpett the publisher with queen victorias favourite novelist  the novelist is in distress he has been offered a title mr crumpett tells him that he should accept it for the honour of literature the great author acquiesces with a sigh he says he can hardly imagine sir william shakespeare and no friendship in literature is more truly pathetic and charming than that of the poet ith the young matthew arnold dodsonan episode which keeps the story human and relieves the mad and stifling tragedy of its close in these days those who would proclaim  one genius more  can hardly hope for a hearing however just their arguments or good their cause we have no desire to be extravagant in our laudation of mr snaith he has given us only three books that are literature and only one masterpiecewilliam 7ordan 7unior

book the same skilful use is made of real history how much have we all been indebted to novelwriters for our knowledge of history it would seem to us that shakespeares historical plays scotts novels and some others give a far greater insight into the past than the most careful collection of state documents there is as much difference as to the influence of such works on our memory and hearts as

been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the

both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest

the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy

illustration of the character of its occupant in its form and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements  but in ils furniture anti equipments it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation the lamp which swung from the upper deck was of solid silver and though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity there was that in its shape and ornaments which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character massive candlesticks of the same precious metal and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation were on a venerable tible whose mahogany was glittering with the polish ol hail a century and whose gilded claws anti carved supporters bespoke au original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship a conch covered with cut velvet stood along the transom  while a divan of blue silk lay against the bulkhead oppoite inanifesin by its fashion its materials and its piles of pillows

taste in the selection ol most of those articles which had been oddly enough made to contribute to the caprice or to cue comfort of their siiguia possessor  lu the midst of this medley of wealth rntl luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt is all in vain however the ship is on the point of sailing when most opportunely the captain breaks his leg and wilder is without loss of time nay on a live minutes intid uiatiou ol the tact installed

B2596,['9458182'],  macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,history

contemjoraries to connected narratives and otters dr farrar has added a multiplicity of materials from the literature of imperial rome at and after the close of the first century with vast labour and perseverance he must have ransacked the satires odes and epigrams as well as the longer works of the most polished latin authors in that most dissolute and demoralised age he has thus put together for the older and younger readers of a sensationloving age a record of deliberate refined and accumulated criminality of murder and lust and cruelty such as would scarcely be found in any other printed book easily accessible to young and impressionable minds though it is true that the author has somewhat softened down the crudest details of neros more ghastly crimes and has avoided altogether the worst features of the age dr farrar has painted this lurid picture for a definite and intelligible purpose in order to exhibit the golden vein of christian faith and profession running through the dense mass of pagan vice and bloodthirstiness and his story ends with the bright refulgence of that dominant faith which was to vanquish the empire of the world considerations of reticence and fastidiousness not to say of exact chronology seem more than once to have given way before the craving of the artist for an effective contrast and certainly it would be impossible to secure a contrast more sharp and striking than that which is here drawn between the ecstasies of the early christian faith and though stews and bloodpits of neros rome mr robertson also deserves credit for a manful effort to restore the historical novel could any man do so with success he would be a benefactor to the age but the aspirant must contend with many difficulties when the greatest of historical novelists aroused the interest of two nations and then of the world he had the benefit of the absence of the scientific historian and of the presence of a vague national pride in though past in our

mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,history
B1782,['3167331'],  the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,history

against nature and womanhood was held as light in the balance when weighed with a want of respect to one of the royal residences  well custom is a surprising thing and when we think how  from earliest

transparent beauty of her style the volume of thought now temperately satirical now deeply philosophical the involuntary burst of genuine poetry and the tender yet almost desponding sentiment that per

parade of vanity to offer public consolation even to those sorrows with which be has entrusted the public but of this we feel assured that she is now only walking through a darkened grove to emerge into the brightest fields of sunshine with a long vista of joy before her then the beauties of her compositions will be no longer as now roses seen in the twilight with the clew upon them heavy with their own tears but she will wreathe us springflowers as of old and she will discover and make an admiring world glad participators in her discovery that this world is neither a theatre of vanity nor a wilderness of thoms,history

B7821,['9336498'],  kidnapped being memoirs of the adventures of david balfour in the year 1751 literature by robert louis stevenson cassell  co it seems to be considered necessary that the schoolboy of the period should be supplied with a new story of adventure for every day in the week it also seems to be considered necessary that men of genius should be told off to write themmen who like mr rider haggard and mr stevenson are sorely needed to produce stories for men and women the consequence is that some of the most picturesque and vigorous imaginative writing that has been produced of late years is to be found in such boys books as 4 king solomons mines 4 treasure island and the tale before us we are not sure that this is entirely a fortunate circumstance in novels written for adult readers it is not enough to furnish a rapid succession of brilliant scenes these scenes must be accounted for by that severe logic of the imagination which is as inexorable as the logic of the schools but in stories written for boys the action moves in entire freedom from those conditions which are at once the trammel and the strength of true art hence in fictive art no boys story can hold a very high place no matter how powerful may be the imagination informing it perhaps we had better give an illustration of our meaning when the writer of a boys story wants as in king solomons mines to bhow how in a great battle between many thousands of savage combatants two eng lish heroes can display prodigies of strength and valour equal to those of achilles or sigurd and yet come out of the fray unwounded he can without hesitation furnish his heroes with european chainarmour the moment it is requiredfind it stowed away in the armoury of an african tribe who are ignorant of firearms and who like the ancient mexicans and peruvians actually believe the white men to have fallen from the stars and when as in the book before us the writer of a boys story wants to show the superhuman fighting powers of a hero a highland soldier he can depict him fighting and conquering an entire ships crew of reckless desperadoes and fireeaters fighting and conquering them singlehanded save for the aid of a boy who knows not how to handle sword or pistol such incidents as these which are perfectly legitimate in a boys story would be absurd in a story for adults and it is a first principle of criticism that no form of art is very high if it can dispense with the logic of imagination this is seen plainly enough if we compare the prowess of mr stephensons alan breck in the roundhouse with the feats of dandy dinmont in the smugglers cave while in the one case the very charm of the thing lies in its boyish freedom from the restraints of imaginative logic in the other every incident of the contest is explained and accounted for as rigidly as though it were matter of actual history of both  guy mannering  and 4 kidnapped the main action was suggested by the annesley case that marvellous romance of real life which in 4 the wandering heir not even charles read could effectually vulgarise and spoil for future use and no doubt it may be said that the true story of young annesley is crowded with adventures more wonderful and exploits more incredible than those to be found in  kidnapped no doubt it may be said that in balfours struggle with old ebenezer there is nothing so improbable as the real struggle of annesley with his wicked uncle and that annesleys adventures in the plantations the fight between the iroquois girl and the slaveowners daughter for possession of the slave annesleys escape from the indian girls brothers and his subsequent more astonishing escape from the gallows at chester as an unconscious accomplice in an elopement surpass in wonderfulness any of the chances escapes and disasters that befell balfour but the saying that  truth is stranger than fiction has an artistic as well as a moral application fiction dares not be so strange as truth save in a boys story where strangeness and exaggeration are it seems not only tolerated but demanded but after the fight in the roundhouse 4 kidnapped passes as we are going to show into a new artistic phasethe phase of true art where no exaggeration and no artistic insincerity can have a place unlike annesley and unlike young ellangowan mr stevensons hero is not carried abroad after all and here perhaps the book as a story attractive to boys will be found to fall behind  treasure island and 4 king solomons mines what boys love above everything else is new scenery and to baulk the expectation of the scenery of wonderland aroused by the opening chapters of this story is exceedingly dangerous having tasted the delight of 4 treasure island and  king solomons mines the boy reader who follows david balfours adventures up to the point of his landing at mull will most likely be disappointed at finding that he is not to be taken to the plantations and yet as has been just indicated it is here where the story passes into literature as a picture of the state of scotland immediately after 1745 we do not hesitate to say that there is nothing in history and nothing in fiction equal to these remarkable chapters it is not only as vivid as a wordpicture by carb lyle it is true and always true as a pici ture by carlyle is false and always false when the hero has left the ship and the i kidnapping scheme is entirely frustrated and not till then we come upon such really vital really organic work as mr stevenson has never given us in his stories for adults such as 4 prince otto 4the new arabian nights and the striking novelette in the court and society review called 4 olalla while the adventures in connexion with though wicked uncle though unquestionably vigorous are excogitated the adventures in the highlands are imagined and this makes us think that it was merely in order to bring in these latter adventures that the somewhat stale business of the kidnapping was resorted to for it should always be remembered in criticising fiction that in the mind of every true storyteller the story passes through two stages the stage when the group of situations is conceived or as we say  invented and the stage when they are really imagined when the inventors mind has become as familiar with them as though he had actually lived in them not till it has reached the latter i stage can imaginative work in any art become vital and so to speak organic this  is why the dramatic work of the novel of ingenious plot is almost always excogitated while that of stories allowed to grow chapter by chapter like the best of scotts is imagined this is why in short there is more imagination in a single page of 4 the antiquary than in an entire story by gaboriau scott though a hasty writer does not as gaboriau does depict a scene because a mechanically constructed plot has forced him to do so but because the scene suggested to him originally by some local anecdote or by some chapter of historyhas lain in his mind for so long a time that all the imaginative energy at his command is called up as soon as he begins to write about it in other words the plot grows out of the scenes the scenes do not grow out of the plot hence in the deepest and truest sense scott often called the most improvisatorial is the least improvisatorial of writers 4 monte cristo furnishes the most striking illustration of what we mean those portions of the romance which precede the working out of the revenge are imagined while those portions which deal with the revenge are excogitated why the latter portions were written first before the story had taken root in the novelists imagination the portions dealing with the imprisonment and the finding of the treasure were written after the story had taken root originally the narrative began with the adventures of the count in italy when he wae plotting his revenge the earlier portions of the work as we now have it were rapidly glanced at for working purposes by way of retrospective dialogue but maquet in talking over the story with dumas suggested that by this method of structure the finest chances afforded by the plot were missed and advised that the narrative should begin not in italy with the revenge but in marseilles with the conspiracy the imprisonment and the finding of the treasure dumas acted upon this and found that thanks to his previous work upon the materials his imagination was now able to live in the situations startling and romantic as they were though as a rule the strength of dumas lies in invention rather than in imagination now of  kidnapped the highland portions alone are imagined hence we cannot but think that for these portions the entire story such as it is was invented a story which simply tells how a manly young hero of the old type struggles with an uncleusurper of the old type and after many adventures and hairbreadth escapes by sea and landadventures and escapes having nothing to do with any proper peripeteiacomes into his own through the good offices of providence and the conventional stage lawyer of the latinquoting type in the highland portions the imagination is of an exceedingly high and rare kind the scenes are flashed not only upon the mental vision but upon the actual senses of the reader and even in the earlier chapters where there is but little imagination in this narrow sense we come across single touches where there is imagination but then it leaps up in a short sudden dazzling flame as where the cry forced from the murderous uncle by superstitious terror is likened in sound to a sheeps bleat in the perfect the ideal storyteller imagination and invention would of course be found in equipoise until recent years the word imagination had a meaning so wide that it included both fancy and invention hence our remarks may not be generally intelligible it seems strange that coleridge was the earliest critic who gave that special meaning to the word  fancy  which it now owns but even now invention and imagination are often confounded critics are apt to use the two words as loosely as did the critics of the eighteenth century as loosely for instance as did alexander pope in his remarks upon the invention in the homeric poems the truth is however as we have before pointed out when writing of homer that it is these very same homeric poems which above everything else in literature alford striking examples of the deep distinction between the inventive and imaginative faculties and it is certainly very singular that those wicked homeric critics who in our own time represent the ancient chorizontes and arouse the wrath of mr andrew lang have never brought forward the strongest of all arguments in favour of the separate authorship of the iliad and the odysseythe argument that while the odyssey shows a very wonderful power of primary invention the iliad shows almost none at all and that while in the odyssey imagination though powerfully active is always ready to yield to invention in the iliad the imaginative force is as unyielding to all demands of invention whether primary or accessory as shakespeares own perhaps however could we pursue the subject here we should find the most remarkable instance of the difference between an imaginative and an inventive poet to be furnished by the cases of shakespeare and spenser but we are concerned at the present moment with prose fiction alone and charlotte bronte affords us an example of a writer in whom the imaginative faculty was very great but whose inventive faculty scarcely existed at all after the professor was rejected on account of deficiency of plotinterest she set to work to construct a plot of the sensational kind and gave us the ugly old situation of a maniac hidden away in a country house the entire plot showing how the lowood governess narrowly escaped committing bigamy with her master whose mad wife was secretly imprisoned at fieldhead was as poor and banal as that of any of those4 shilling dreadfuls that add to the horrors of the railway stations and seem just now to threaten the very existence of prose fiction and yet  jane eyre stands at the top of english romances for sheer imaginative strength on the other hand a writer like the author of 4 called back while showing a very considerable power of invention seems to have been absolutely without the imaginative facultythat faculty which is seen at work in the story before us and entitles it to the attention it is now receiving from us the humorous portions of 4 kidnapped are of a very high order the musical contest between robin oig and alan breck is to be ranked with the finest humorous scenes of scott alan breck is a great success and the hero davie balfour really lives and breathes that he is a landsman to the very marrow is well indicated by his mistaking a tidal islet for a real robinson crusoe island but it is difficult to imagine the veriest landlubber p 122 gazing at the sea from a lonely land saying that it strikes the soul  with a kind of fear on the contrary it is from a ghostly flat or a range of spectral cliffs that the sight of the sea seems to drive away the superstitious terrors conjured up by some landscapes amid superstitious dreads on the loneliest coast on the dimmest night a sense of companionship comes with the smell of seaweed,history
B4938,"['8837485', '3164829']",  a monk of fife by andrew lang long mans  co it is the weakness of every historical romance that one knows beforehand the inevitable endso far that is as history is concerned even in twenty years after the musketeers can never one feels conscious effect the rescue of charles i and similarly in the penultimate chapter of a monk of fife one foresees with regret that normans brave effort to save the maid of orleans can result only in failure the regret none the less is there and attests the truth and vigour of this storya story that could fitly be written by a scot but not for sheer shame by an englishman whose forefathers might have helped to burn the maid it is a story worthy of its theme there is nothing in it of that overelaboration of style which mars so many of our recent novels no it is simple and quaint and beautiful like a stainedglass window in some old english church the norman leslie who as an old monk writes the chronicle is a young scholar of st andrews a good golfer and something withal of a painter forced by a misadventure to flee to france he takes service with joan of arc and is in her company from her beginning even until her end there are others of course  the villainous cordelier brother thomas elliot hume the sweet scottish maiden whom we like well the little jackanapes whom we like almost better and many moreand the whole book is instinct with life and passion and tenderness at two points and two points only do we cavil whether a native of fife who had lived for the most part abroad would be likely to speak of the  corries of the north and whether brother thomas who had  forgotten his clergy who could not read would ever have been promoted to say mass before the french king indeed that promotion vexes us we like in a novel to have the archtraitor punished the pictures by selwyn image go admirably with the narrative  a monk of fife we doubt whether mr langs interest in romantic literature and his conceivable ambition to be among its purveyors are enough to account for the writing of  a monk of fife as you read you feel it is a pious act the dedication of power and learning to the service of one who has struck his imagination with singular force and enlisted for the glorification of her memory all the ardour of his nature he has written as men used to paint pictures in a believing age his story of the maid especially in its central incidents follows likewise something of the conventions that were long observed in ecclesiastical art a high spiritual subject cannot be duly perceived realistically and not by all if described in the tongue of our common thoughts a thing apart has a language apart and for the language apart he has chosen the language of an earlier day this hampers a man for most purposes but sometimes a right instinct guides to its adoption as here it has preserved for his less imaginative readers at least the remote glory of jeanne his jeanne is the fair saint of some mystical glasspainter or some pious tapestry artist not the peasant jeanne whose uncouth yet spiritual beauty has been pathetically rendered by bastien lepage the same instinct has produced the drawings of mr selwyn image but in them convention has entirely ignored beauty those who are familiar with mr langs free quick witty everyday style will be astonished at the exquisite careful mosaic here with its bright colour and its glittering fragments of gold all wrought with a strict recognition of the limits of the art everything is lucid save the mysterious glamour of the maid sometimes the figures are seen black and clearly lined as against a yellow sunset sky sometimes richly coloured with the sun of midday streaming through them there is hardly a line too much anywhere a tribute should be paid to the learning of the bookand learning is no such superfluity in a historical romance as is commonly supposed the great historical novelists have all written out of a full and intimate knowledge of the highroads and the byeways of the time they were representing never finding a crowded memory choke their invention we have named in the first place the surprising and beautiful art of the book because it sets it in a place apart and then its evidence of zealous research which has added greatly to our clear realisation of an epoch because these are its two chief distinctions but as a story it takes a high place too we went back by the way to read passages over again for our pleasure but we have seen others hurrying to the end carried on by the narrative by the fortunes good and bad of norman leslie from his youthful escapade in scotland through his long devoted service to the maidharassed wounded imprisoned for her sake and with her at the endtill he finds rest in the abbey of pluscarden by the black villainy of noiroufle by the gay lovingkindness of elliot the interest certainly never flags mr morris makes his poetical prose romances a little hard to read by keeping too much on the same level of dignity and remoteness the mlaid towers aloft here with space for light around her but in the cornets of the picture are familiar incidents and personages playing their parts with homely realism the contrast stimulates the attention and helps the sense of proportion we take back one comment and say better even than the beauty of the workmanship better than the story are the clear airs in the book the peace and light of a great purpose shown above the storm and stress of war  a monk of fife being the chronicle written by norman

B2108,['8526331'],  the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in

servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she

mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,history

B8799,['8524263'],  sister louise sister louise or thc story of a womans repentance by g j why temelville london  chapman and hall it is pleasant to be disappointed in a book that opens in the most approved style of the historical novel with a dialogue between two soldier friends in the low countries two hundred years ago  who call each other comrade dash dowtn a plumed hat toss oft a stoup of wine and have a faroff memory in their deep grey eyes and for this reason because the vividness of the local colouring though safety in the application of it and the tinsel of the dummy royalties that crowd the canvas make a novel whose scene is remote in time and country the citadel of ignorant and shallow writers and though fools paradise of those vacuous gapers who must have blazonry and bunting even in what they read and so  i faith and  byre ladye  do duty for dialogue  and a surface of pomp and circumstance ostentation and affectation pass themselves off as the workings of human nature on that large class who have either never felt or never analysed their feelings but when an author who has some instinctive insight into though machinery of thc heart and who writes besides with that  easy grace and selfrestrained strength which is the sure token of a gentleman of culture and a man of the world selects a certain century to frame his picture in it is the picture and not the frame that we observe and his manipulation of accessories that are unfamiliar to us makes us either admire his skill the more or possibly regret that the strangeness of the surroundings distracts and distorts our view of the characters conspicuous instances of this are  romola and those novels of scott which are chiefly historical surely it is always in spite of and not because of their pecuharity that we praise those books and it is because in  sister louise an honest development of characters wrought with no little skill and delicacy outshines its setting of upholstering gorgeousness that we say it is a good book worth writing and worth reading an outline of the story is briefly this louise de la valliere and athenee de mortemar are two girls well born and straitly bred who become maids of honour at the court of the youthful and beautiful louis quatorze with the strictest propriety wre are told how they both of them ceased in any sense of the word to deserve that designation louise has a devoted lover the marquis de bragelone he of the faroff eyes athenee has a dashing admirer henri le blanc the brother of louise and these two gentlemen complicate themselves in fruitless rivalry with the king to whose attractions both ladies but for different reasons succumb each retiring at the close of his reignlouise to the selftormenting repentance of a convent where she dies and athenee to the seclusion of displacement and disgust where she passes from our view  and the widow scarron madame de maintenon reigns in her stead the person and character of the heroine louise are carefully and we should imagine truly drawn  soft blue eyes and tender quivering mouth delicate rather than regular of features a face of which the primrose is the type among flowers and the pearl among precious stones her figure was well formed and agile though hampered by a limp in afterlife rivals declared she was lame and denied she was beautiful but the very vehemence of their criticism offers its best contradiction    her nature was one of entire selfdevotion totally irrespective of self in striking contrast to her stands out the saucy and unscrupulous athenee who loves the king designedly and not because she cannot help it supplants her early friend jilts her first lover is worldly to the backbone and yet not without shallow qualms of temporary contrition nor without that intermittent breath of a better affection which blows hot and cold in so many shallow women there is great sameness in love affairs says this roue of twenty one man pleases more than another and that is all and so for a vantageground she marries the rich monsieur de montespan and keeps a line to hold her former lover weaving her net round the king all the while louise on the other hand is a tender and true woman all sensitiveness and selfabnegation  every sense and instinct of nature and romance held in thrall by youthful kinghood and worshipping with idolatry a thoroughly selfish man  simply because something must be offered up there is something very touching in the story of her love and how it slowly palls upon the king and how she falls from disappointment to despair till remorse and a broken heart beat themselves away in an ascetic infatuation and the king the petted and pampered the favourite of gods and men following his better instincts in trying to love her notwithstanding the boredom which grows upon him all the more because of her utter resignation of all her personality to him he too is painted with truth and not without force but there is an uneasiness about any character that is half fact and half fiction still it is work worthy of an artist to trace the course of such a love as his  whose gradations are slow and sure custom indifference weariness and neglect he is princely according to the popular idea of kinghood in magnificence in assumption of omnipotence in graceful treading on the necks of men  he wages battle under the eyes of ladies and in full dress but indeed it is not so difficult to draw something that will pass muster for a character if you put it on a pedestal saying  this is a great king and the millinery is a la louis quatorze to reveal what detail of plot there is would be hardly fair for there is very little and the book does not depend upon its plot and is all the more readable for the simplicity of it the description of the hunt is good or it would not have been written by the author of  katerfelto the conversations are terse and witty and smack very strongly of the french the opening scene in the low countries is superfluous  and the whole of the last book which is an enlargement on the penances of  louise de la misericorde might have been curtailed with advantage but even as it is the story is commendably short nor is there a weak sentence throughout nor one that jars upon the taste even the magnificence is not tawdrily described the book is natural notwithstanding its setting and is obviously written by a gentleman the sentences are occasionally very long but they never seem longwinded it is true that we meet with many familiar commonplaces in an elegant disguise and that many a harmless sentiment stalks by us with an unwonted dignity but it is none the less a pleasure and not a common one to meet with a story not very long and not very pretentious temperately and smoothly told where there is nothing of strain or vulgarity or rant no stilts and no crimes except adultery  no horrors and no vapours of course there is much that might be quarrelled with is it true as is here laid down that when a man and a woman carry a sorrow between them the man displays and the woman feels it the most  is it true that there is a sinking of the heart which never deceives and is surely followed by evil  it is rather that the shadow of the present throws itself back into the past but assertions like these not being written by one of the great masters of mental analysis are harmless enough and were possibly not intended as deliberate conclusions on the other hand the book abounds in aphorisms and epigrammatic bits of description here is one which if it is original is too good not to be quoted  the princess henriette was just enough of a stuart to see clearly the one side of a question to ignore the other and to defy the consequences of the whole a book that is short natural and interesting is worth reading,history

B6729,['6701677'],  new novels blue and green or the gift of god by sir henry pottinger in three volumes chapman  hall vixen by thc author of  lady audleys secret in three volumes j  r maxwell marco visconti translated from the italian by a d in three volumes charing cross publishing company my friend and my wife by henry james gibbs in three volumes s tinsley co sir henry pottinger has undertaken one of the most difficult of literary tasks in the book before us further described on the titlepage as  a romance of old constantinoplenamely that of writing an historical novel which shall make a fardistant and quite unfamiliar past live again and interest the modern reader and as we have had occasion to remark before the exceptional brilliancy of charles kingsleys hypatia has made success of this kind much less easy of attainment than ever it is doing sir henry pottinger no more than justice to say that his romance is the best of the kind which has appeared since hypatia and if it fall short of that work in any respect it is from no lack of ability culture and diligence but merely because all these qualities united are necessarily unequal to the imaginative insight of a poet the topic he has chosen is the strange and eventful history of justinian and theodora while the  blue and green  of the chief title has reference to the rival factions of the hippodrome the veneti and prasini whose competition in politics and theology was one of the greatest dangers to social order in the sixth century the author declares that one of his aims has been to rehabilitate theodoras character at any rate as regards the latter part of her life and notably in her conjugal relations with justinian and to maintain the thesis that not only was she however degraded in her theatrical days more sinned against than sinning even then but that she is a real instance of genuine repentance amendment and purification in her whole subsequent conduct it is known of course by all scholars that the horrible profligacy attributed to her almost unparalleled even in the annals of hetaerism rests entirely on the anecdotes in the  secret history  of procopius to which sir henry pottinger declines to accord any credit herein he is supported by the judgement of the late dean milman who brands it as  the basest and most disgraceful work in literature and as a  virulent libel whose insincerity is proved by its direct contradictions to its authors other published writings on the whole the history of the time has been carefully studied and adhered to and its most famous personagesjustinian and theodora themselves john of cappadocia hypatius belisarius and antonina ecebolus the tyrianare represented on the canvas the author has selected his episodes with much judgment and has allowed himself but few liberties with the chronicles which supply him with the materials for his narrative the most serious beinghis assignment of the first infatuation of justinian for theodora to the very beginning of her career just before her appeal as an orphan suppliant to the generosity of the factions instead of to the date of her return from africa after disappearing from constantinople in company with ecebolus and the softening of the reverses experienced by belisarius in the persian and arabian war and the only important anachronism is that he represents both anastatius aud justinian as specifically claiming merely the empire of the east whereas the fact is that the western empire was finally extinguished early in the reign of zeno about eighteen years before justinian was even born so that the rulers of constantinople claimed the obedience of the west as sole emperors until long after their carolling rivals had taken their places in gaul and italy the third volume of blue and green albeit containing a vivid description of the famous  nika revolt of the factions is less successful than its predecessors perhaps from being less of a romance and more of a summarised history but partly no doubt because fidelity to truth obliges the author to acknowledge how far his hero and heroine fell below the promise of their opening reignhow theodora substituted the vices of greed vindictiveness and cruelty for those of ber former career and how justinian did not exercise his great qualities impartially for the good of his subjects but was their fiscal oppressor without being their defender against either foreign war or domestic turbulence his likeness to louis xiv in wars building and theological fanaticism and also in the manner in which he impressed the imaginations of those brought into contact with him is a curious historical parallel which has not received the attention it deserves and which has escaped our present authors notice in the scholarly preface of his interesting book vixen is a story in miss braddons later and better manner put together with but a small stock of incidents and yet vivid and readable with tokens of real hard work cropping out every now and then to show that the author does not rest on her natural facility of invention and diction nor yet on her established popularity as an excuse for ceasing to take pains and to lay in continually fresh supplies of reading for illustrative purposes the little bits of learning arc not always quite accurate and are sometimes rather dragged in than brought in but there is nothing visible of the audacious blundering in all departments of knowledge which gives such a ludicrous colour to the novels of some of her lady competitors the present story is almost entirely restricted to the new forest save for one transfer of scene to jersey and miss braddon writes of the charming woodland scenery of hampshire with evident local knowledge and strong personal interest her heroine a generous spoiled child of quick temper is very cleverly sketched and not overdrawn and the manly commonplace hero with no bookish tastes but not in the least guy livingstonish is also a good portrait though here and there his remarks are not too shrewd but a little too cultured to be quite in keeping we recognise him better when remarking of a room newly doneup in the very last south kensington highart style with high chocolate dado all round that it looks as if they had run short of wallpaper than when quoting tennyson or using scraps of french there is humour too in a gentleman carrying off his ladyloves unreadable browningesque verses and handing them over to his private secretary to digest analyse and comment on and then coming out with the criticism at first hand and making all the running in consequence and there is judgement in not overdoing the objectionable stepfather in the story when it would have been easy to represent him as illusing the wife whoso fortune alone he sought and squandering her income whereas his selfishness is more enlightened and more natural as actually depicted vixen is not one of those books which either make or mar a reputation  but it is pleasantly readabe and as we have said shows tokens of honest pains spent in making it so marco visconti is simply tommaso grossis wellknown historical novel in an english dress grossi followed manzoni whom he acknowledged as his master much as g p r james followed walter scott and truth to say at very much the same distance the book enjoys a considerable reputation in italy whose literature is not even yet rich in historical novels though it possesses a few notable ones  but if manzoni had written more grossi would be less esteemed the era of the story is the stirring midst of though fourteenth century when the famous warrior who gives it his name was a very remarkable figure not unlike henry of guise two hundred years later and grossi has taken great pains to work contemporary history into his plot as well as to give his readers graphic scenes from the daily life of the period among which the riot in a church between the partisans of the rival popes is perhaps the most vivid but the story is thin and poor with personages of little interest and the reader remains quite unaffected by the tragedy which is intended to move though very depths of his nature to pity and regret the consciousness that they are mere layfigures in a costume painting never dies out and while we look with appreciation on the happy rendering of this breastplate and that beaker the human figures attract little observation the translation is well done and rarely shows the influence of foreign idioms while there are some very respectable renderings of the verses which grossi intercalated in his narrative my friend and my wire is a crude book with a few occasional patches of merit but on the whole is rather hard reading the writer does not seem to have got his scheme clearly before him and gets rather  mixed  in consequence take the title for example lt clearly denotes that the book is autobiographical and thc persons named in it the belongings of thc writer but when we come to the story itself it purports to be a narrative written by the heros tutor who is the 41 i of the story but who is not married at all so that the second  my of thc titlepage if not the first also applies to though hero and ought to be  his  so again it is not easy to make out the chronology lt is after sir robert peels death which was in 150 and before pimlico was built at least ten years earlier it is before the establishment of competitive examinations in the civil service and after the movement for the sanitary reform of j london courts nor is the tale better managed though hero is cast off by his father a rich manufacturer for refusing to bribe the officials who have though bestowal of government contracts and comes to great straits in consequence but ho has married the only and beloved child of a wealthy canon who does not quarrel with his daughter because of her choice and yet no penny of her fortune comes to them nor does she ever think of applying to her father for help though she does so to her brotherinlaw and whereas though heros bosomfriend seduces though wife and actually elopes with her being barely stopped in time by the opportune arrival on the scene of the seducers uncle a fine old french abbe the pair come home again and return to the old domestic footiug of intimate acquaintanceship as if nothing had happened to be sure the gay lothario goes ott as a missionary to africa after a while but that is a later arrangement there are as we have said occasional scraps of better quality here and there in the story and the writer can sometimes sketch a single scene or situation fairly enough but he has neither constructive skill nor staying power and the best thing in the narrative is the character of the heros younger brother always full

B2164,"['8500512', '4382121', '8773746']",  mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and his only child to explain their views and positions  papa are we going to stay in new boston for ever   ask kiss raveel  al i fde i w 5papa r yes know vwhe i eam ane you going  t  wi elreiiem to in

papa when i am as old as you are and you are as young as i am ill satirise you dreadfullywell if we are going io live in new boston why cant we keep house  this extract gives a good idea of the pleasant natural style in which the book is written the doctor is a most delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy matters i mst confess sid the doctor resuming his seat that this is a most attractive and flattering proposition i am vain enough to believe that i could be of use to this poor ignorantbrutish downtrodden insulted plundered race of pariahs and helots if i could orgaise negro labour in louisiana on a basis jut and profitable to all partieishould consider myself more honoured than by being made president of the united ates in ordinary times if i could be the means of educating their darkened minds and consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his child how tender is his care for her how devoted his attachment i how pleasant and how playful his manner yet always so full of sympathy and wathful love  he and colbourn the volunteer captain are both made superior to ordinary mortals they can be hardhearted to themselves but they are always tenderhearted to their neighbours the cut the burden of their own troubles and griefs behind their backs that they may sympathies with those of their friends the virtues of the parent ae reflected in his child lmeli is the worthy daughter of such a father the gaiety of her temper is the charucteristic which chiefly charms the reder the personal beauty which exercises so potent a spell over all with whom she has to do cannot really afford any particular pleasure to one who only reads of it beauty must be seen to be appreciated there is but small satisfaction in hearing of a beauty one is never likely to se but as we road we csot help feeling the pleasant hw lp di har iature and thiundg with the  e wi she s with uh i t fortitudi whi we admieher ble um  a t it to its sourc in the wivitr of her mind and

a ldier life seem to us photo r al the details are brought out so vividly the enn and tediousn of life in camp the restraint of discipline and the frequent negligenes of volunteers the reckless rush of some to the charge whilst others are skulking behind the terrors of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special

historical romance could alone have brought to the task to say of the author of whitehall that he has not entirely succeeded in his ambitious aim is to say of him only that he is not the greatest writer of his age and we frankly admit that it would be unfair to try him by an extraordinary standard compared with his contemporaries he is not inferior to any of theis in some of the qualities requisite for this class of literature he is equal to most of them in the accomplishments necessary for the production of fiction of any kind is descriptive powers are great  he has read up well for the occasion he has keen perceptions of the nicer shades of character and his soul is in his work so that he writes with the flow of a full mind and carries the reader onward by force of a certain energy which is felt although incapable of definition but these excellences are mingled with manifest faults his composition is often careless and ungraceful his plot is wanting in artistic skill  he resorts too much to the tricks of the novelist relies for his effects upon the unnatural or supernatural mistakes the wonderful for the grand and the melodramatic for the dramatic lie is copious of contrivances for any difficulty but they are so farfetched mo thoroughly beyond the bounds of probability that they offend the readers sense of propriety and often produce a smile where a striking surprise was intended this tendency of the writer to exaggerationthis convulsive straining after effect wau apparent in his previous novel but it has grown with his growth and is still more obvious and more repulsive here another fault he has fallen into in common with many of his predecessors he has been overanxious to press into his pages all the great personages of the time and to bring this about he has resorted to contrivances so out r so wild so out of the natural order of things that the design is made palpable to the reader whose interest in the affair departs the moment he is compelled to feel that all these good people have been brought together to show off the writer and not to ad vance the story it is in the strictly historical portions of the romance that the author excels ihe is skilful in dramatising actual events bringing them before us not as mere dry details of facts but with their accessories of men and manners and dialogues that paint them upon the fancy

seem now for the dark ones that were coming the only sorrow among us that i remember was when the pestilence brake out in the oth year of our young king which at first only prevailed in the north but at length reached london where it raged with prodigious fury carrying oft 800 souls the first week and mostly after a sickness of only twelve or twentyfour hours we had it not on the bridge which wa attributed to the free access of fresh air to our dwellings  howbeit mistress anne like a ministering angel as she wassuch a child too  only in her twelfth year  must needs go about relieving poor wretches in their dwellings whereby she caught a low fever that brought her to deaths door and filled the house with tears if my master a man in years forbare not to weep reason was a lad such as i should weep too howbeit through the grace of god she recovered  but for a long time she was too enfeebled to walk wherefore master hewet took her much on the water during the long summer evenings after we had been nigh stiffled by the days sultry heat for the eastern side of the house was close and the western though open yet was much exposed to the glare of the sun on the river we shut it out with blinds and lattices all we could but still the crown ofthe day was after sundown on the water master hewet liked his prentices to pull and sometimes we fell into the wake of some court barge with horns and sackbuts and lay on our oars  mistress anne full silent resting her head for weakness against my masters shoulder and with the tears sometimes stealing down from her large bright eyes my master carried her down to the boat but twas my portion for i will not say burthen to carry her up how light she was she did not much like it and managed present ij to ascend slowly with the help of my masters arm but i remember the goodness and sweetness with which with a sweet blush on her face she sayth  do you remember the first time  but for thee i had not been here now as she strengthened

certainly unknown to citizens in the sixteenth century and the phrase they are quite exploded now at genteel tables could never have been used by mistress fraunces such finical phraseology belongs to the ladies maids of the present day not to the housewife of king edwards we must protest also against the traitors heads which at this period garnished the bridge being compared to  so many plumpuddings prickt on spits the writer who with spasmodic effort after originality compared daisies on the greensward to  miniature eggs on spinage was scarcely guilty of so gross a violation of good taste but we may as well remind the writer that plumpuddings in their old original shape were roll upand in that form like an enormous sausage they are still to be seen in remote parts of the country as the time for this agehallowed dainty is so near approaching perhaps some of our young england readers may thank us for this passing remark and have their puddings as well as their other christmas observances after the strictly orthodox fashion the representation of osbornes mother as  well to do with 200 by the year is also very incorrect at a time when wages of labourers were at the utmost but 87 a day and when even the kings servants thought 20 per annum a handsome remuneration  han3 holbein himself receiving but 30 fixed salary200 a year would have been the income of a lady of almost

people as the queen of holland and because her quick and sympathetic nature enabled her to understand perfectly so many of her friends and pupils that she has become one of the most interesting figures in french social history in her wonderful and useful career are interwoven the symbolic bees of napoleon and the bourbon lilies of franceboth stained with the blood of the revolution and ofas

leisure from the birth of henriette genist and her acquaintance with the roi bienaime until the last line is penned and this remarkable woman lies in 1822 at peace at last in the cemetery at mantes the intention of the author of this book has been as she says to present a faithful picture of the france of the eil de boeuf and of that greater france when no education was considered complete without a sojourn in paris that parnassus whither napoleon the master mind invited the worlds most gifted artists musicians litterateurs scientists and thinkers this is a bold undertaking but one for which miss montagu would be perfectly fitted but for an occasional efflorescence of style and a slight inclination to wander from the matter in hand but as her more direct work  eugene de beauharnais proved she knows the vast numbers of memoirs of the period perfectly and is completely at ease in later eighteenth and early nineteenth century france while dealing with the fortunes of her heroine all the hurrying pushing palpitating world of louis xv louis xvi of the revolution of the napoleonic era and the confused time that followed are laid before us how low men were and how they rise how high they were and how they tumble o vanity of vanities o laughable pathetic jumble  that is the sort of picture one sees once more in miss montagus interesting pages it is true that much has been told to us before almost all the characters are historical but the author endows them with new life and adds a thousand little touches gathered from wide reading or personal observation which make her story of maman campanfor she was a mother to all the great or wouldbe great ladies of the empirefresh and delightful the reader of today need not trouble himself about the rather heavy and at the same time elusive volumes of memoirs which madame left us for miss montagu has adjusted the stilted style to modern taste the first part of the volume dealing with the court of marie ivntoinette is to some extent madame campans own work wisely edited and assisted by much knowledge gleaned from other and equally useful sources the second part which the author calls the governess of the bonapartes is founded on some of the correspondence between madame campan and the mother of napoleon iii who was of course under her care as hortense de beauharnais and among all her beloved pupils the most beloved the fates may not have allowed all the girls who were brought up by madame campan to prove later very kind or very clever but the governess at least saw that their minds and bodies were perfectly healthy while she could influence them and her carefully thought out methods certainly produced many capable witty women and caused a tradition of wise education to flourish in france even until today madame herself came of a family famous during generations for their taste for hard work and common sense for caution and in some cases coldness but the fine flower of their race the henriette of the present volume combined much knowledge of men and things with wide sympathy and much warmth of character with wisdom which was both lively and discreet from the days when a child lectrice she entered the court of louis xv as the companion of his daughters to the very end she held in her heart the spirit of a devoted and unselfish mother and although her own marriage made by her parents of coursewas unhappy she never failed to make lighter the burdens which others had to bear at fourteen miss montagu says her heroine was in danger of becoming a bluestocking for she was quick and clever and made much of by the various masters of the arts of the day albanesi the most fashionable of singing masters taught her the melodies of the alluring lully while goldoni himself made her familiar with italian the little picture of her as she comes into prominence shows that the bluestocking period was soon over miss montagu pictures her entering the great world wearing a long train her slender figure enclosed in stiff stays and voluminous panniers with her little tearstained face besmirched with rouge and powder her father had given her many wise warnings whenever you receive flattering attentions he said you will gain an enemy of flattery and enemies madame campan had her fair share as the years passed but her head was always cool and her heart true and sound and thus she survivedthe friend of humanity through so many and such various periods of court life her character and her surroundings make her a particularly interesting subject for such a volume as miss montagu gives us it is the life of a wise and sympathetic woman written by anotherand such an alliance will always make a delightful book,history

remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order her arguments do not always carry persuasion but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion it had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority thus gregory xvi displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green turkish trousers

name was john whitehead peard he was a member of a wellknown west country family and he died in 1880 mrs fraser is definite however about that staunch champion of the temporal power cardinal antonelli whom she draws with vigorous strokes  44 in appearance he was a typical south italian small in build darkskinned with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell nothing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them his face wes meant to be mobile but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour he was a rapidly fluent talker and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us the italian chapters in this book are

narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away in the second volume we are trans ported to peking and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two dowager empresses of whom the first died during the boxer rebellion whereupon the second who had been trained for the purpose promptly took her place mrs frasers argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than fortyfive or fifty and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate be that as it may she illustrates the pride of the chinese by a significant story  after the looting of the palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the imperial family through the chinese ambassador take them away exclaimed the minister they are desecrated filthywe never want to see them again mrs fraser concludes with vienna from 1880 to 1882 she does not spare the court and some of her stories about the empress are a little unkind she writes of the unfortunate however in a chivalrous spirit notably of benedek the defeated at sadowa whom she considers to have been the victim of

there are times too i iii the life of man when the spirit excited hy some great and stirring passion or hy mingling with mighty and portentous events seems to gain for a brief instant a confused but magnificent view of splendid things not yet in being imagination in the one case and hope in the other give form aud distinctness to the airy images though both are too soon doomed to fade away amidst the colder realities of the stern world we dwell in the mind of albert maurice had been excited by the scenes lie hat just gone through  and success without making him nrrogant had filled him full of hope mach step that he took forward seemed but to raise him higher and each effort of an enemy to crush him seemed without any exertion of his own but to clear the way before him such thoughts were mingling with other feelings  brought forth by the sight and the roice and the smile of mary of burgundy when the sudden call to her presence woke him from ouch dreams but woke him only to show to his minds eye a thousand confused but bright and splendid images as gay as glittering as pageantlike but as unreal also as the airy vision which hangs in the morning light over the sicilian seas fancy at once called up every thing within thu wide range of possibility battles and victories and triumphant success the shout of nations and of worlds the sceptre the palace and the throne with a thousand indistinct ideas of mighty things danced before his eyes for a moment with a sweeter and brighter image too as the object and end of ambition the reward of mighty endeavour the crowning hoon of infinite success but still he felt and knew even while he dreamed that it was all unreal and as he followed the messenger with a puck pace though vision faded and left him but the cold and naked truth at length after passing through several chambers which flanked thc hall of audience the door of a small apartment called the bower was thrown open and the young burgher stood once more before mary of burgundy lue of the most painful curses of high station is that of seldom if ever being alone of having no moment except those intended for repose in which to commune with ones own heart without the oppression of some human eye watching the emotions of the mind as they act upon the body and keeping sentinel over the hearts index  the face mary of burgundy was not alone though as much alone as those of her station usually are  she stood near ja window at the other side ofthe apartment with her soft rounded arm and delicate hand j twined in those of one of her fair attendants  alice of imbercourton whom she leaned slightly while the lord of imbercourt himself stood beside her on the other hand and with his stately head somewhat bent seemed with all due reverence to give her counsel upon some private matter of importance how beautifully the next landscape is blended with human associations   lt was towards that period of the year which the french call the short summer of st martin from the fact of a few lingering bright days of sunshiny sweetness breaking in upon the autumn as a memorial of the warmer season gone before the sky was full of light and the air full of heat and the grand masses of high grey clouds that occasionally floated over the sun were hailed gladly for their soft cool shadow although the day was the eleventh of november sweeping over the prospect like the mighty but indistinct images of great things and splendid purposes that sometimes cross a powerful but imaginative mind the shadows of thc clouds moved slow over hill aud dale field and forest noss they cast large masses of the woods into dark and gloomy shade and left the rising grounds around to stand forth in light and sparkling brightness giving no bad image of the dark memories that are iu every heart surrounded but not effaced by afterjoys noss they floated soft upon the mountains spreading an airy purple over each dell and cavity while pouring into the midst of the valley

with the unusual circumstauce however of every part of his garb being of a peculiar shade of green  which colour was also predominant in the dress of halfadozen others who appeared at the door by the shrine isle gave no one time to express their surprise k good god  he exclaimed  do you not see the groundlightning coming up the hill  fly fly for your lives it will be over the chapel in a moment

ceremony he caught up alice of imbercourt in his powerful anus one of lus companions lifted the princess and another raised the form of the young lady who had fallen from her horse in the morning and whose terror had now cast her into a swoon  and darting through the door by which they had entered the vert gallant of hannut and his companions passed out into that part of the  forest which swept up to though back of the hapel they escape in perfect safety hut as they return they again pass the chapel    the scene that she there beheld was not a little awful three of the walls of the chapel indeed remained but that was all and the timedried woodwork that had supported the tall conical roof now lay on what had once been the floor still blackened and smouldering though the lire which had been kindled by the lightning was now half extinguished by the suhseiuent rain the chapel itself however though it showed how terrible her own fate might have been was not perhaps the most fearful object that the spot presented th tall majestic tree which had stood alone at a i icw yards in advance of the building was rent  to the very ground  and amidst the shivered j boughs and yellow leaves with which they were  covered lay motionless the beautiful horse that  had been tied there with its strong aud ener1 getic limbs  but a few hours before full oil wild life and noble firenow cold and stilf the wide expansive nostril small and collapsedthe clear eye dim and leaden and the proud head cast powerless down the bank there are few things show so substantially the j mighty and awful power of death as to see ai nollie horse killed by some sudden accident the moment before it stands at the sublimest  point of animal existenceas if the living principle were yielded to it in a greater share j than any other thing and the next it isl shapeless carrion  alas the poor horse  cried mary when her eyes fell upon the gallant beast lying stretched out beneath the tree  alas the poor horse   but by a natural link of association her mind speedily reverted to herself and the fate she had so narrowly escaped  and closing her eyes while the litter i was born on she spent a few moments in i thankful prayer wv shall conclude by repeating our com meiidatioii and opinion that mary of ii ii ry it inly is and it is praise of a very high order the i most interesting and most sustained of mr jamess already so popular historical fictions  mary of burgundy or thc ltccolt of ghcul ky the author of  darnley sec  vols longniiin  co tins is perhaps the best oftho authors works at any rate xve have been much moved by the details and interested in the fate of its leading characters there is we think more true dignity in the conception of the stories ami more chivalrous feeling in the knights mid dames of mr jamess romances than in those of any living novelist lie has the eye of a painter and something of the feeling of the poet he seeks to do justice to the heroic part of human nature and bestows beautiful forms and lofty aspirations he arrays the creations of his fancy in thc splendid costume of the times of the tournaments and throws what thc paintcrscall aline aerial atmosphere over the actions they arc called on to perform vc see too all that the mitbor sees his outline is distinct and bold  we are made familiar xvith thc motives as well as xvith thc deeds of his actors  and what is still better there i is a visible unity of purpose throughout to i which all parts are subordinatea certain  sign of true genius in an author we cannot i however conceal from ourselves that other  writers have excelled him in natural dolinea i timi of character in simplicity of narrative j nid in those electric bursts of passion which kindle all around like sunshine bursting over  a clouded landscape he is likewise a little too fond of painting scenery and describing  dresses and we could lind other faults hut were his faults doubled they are more than atoned for by his beauties among which tte have neglected to reckon a hatred and loathing for all that is mean and base and a desire to lift human nature a degree above the mires and sloughs of vulgar sensuality in which so many natures still delight to wallow the scene of this story is laid in the city of lhent the ehiefaetorsaro princes priiieeses and citizens and the time is during those  stormy days when mary only

his tragic end the author will answer that a narrative for which history had set up landmarks obliged him so to deal with characters created to help out the story this may bo so  still we consider it unfair to create ii noble creature only to show how handsomely he ctn be knocked on the head we are of opinion that though author has adhered too closely to history  it was enough to have caught its spirit and worn its dress without undertaking to perform all its particular actions,history
