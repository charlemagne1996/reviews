  my brother by vincent brown pierrots library lane so delicate so genuine a piece of work as this comes into a readers hands but seldom our respect for it steadily grew with every chapter and respect is too cold a word to use for the warm feelings it rouses before the end it is with no wish to discount the writers originality but merely to give readers a clue to the kind of book we are heartily recommending that we say it reminds us strongly of miss montresors  into the highways and the hedges one of the very very few books of religious fiction written in late years that deserve remembrance the heroes of both are of that strange little wonderful sect followers in very truth of jesus christ but paul penfold is no echo of any other hero of fiction he is stamped with human reality the description of his relations with the children his love for them his admiration for their audacity his genuine not quite pleasurable wonder that they should find him queer could not be simpler or stronger while the tale of the murderers flight and of his mothers uneasy wanderings with the secret in her breast that cost the world a saint are proofs of the writers power to deal with spiritual conflicts  my brother by vincent brown john lane the reviewer stands dismayed in the presence of my brother with the ordinary novel one is on terms more or lessr of equality on the authors side is the wish to entertain to beguile to interest on though critics side is the wish to say to what extent the writer has succeeded and to place the book among other works of literary artifice probably also the critic will refer to the authors previous output and express the hope that it will not be long before his next volume appears but the customary routine is not to de followed with my brother the book so comes from the heart is so passionate an utterance of a compassionate nature that the thought of other writings vanishes for the moment literature has ceased to be artifice and has become an action spontaneous as movement or speech with the author of my brother we feel that the ordinary method has been reversed  instead of the novelist seeking the story the story appears to have sought him it dwelled with him year after year awaiting the fit season ana when that season was ripe though spirit of humanity one almost might say took the pen and wrote for him my brother is an epic of selfsacrifice the tale is of a village solitary a crippled visionary christlike in purity accounted mad by some and foolish by allcalled humorously by his neighbours tho prophetwho so loved a family of his fellowbeings that he took upon himself the sin of one of them and laid down his life that this other might live and tears bo unshed the story setting forth this great renunciation is clear as a stream and it moves as tranquilly and surely the author has conquered every temptation to writ finely in the place of writing fitly and though fruit of his resistance is a narrative so plain and so closely woven that it is impossible to extract any ono passage as illustrative of his method it must be all or none we havo the welding of form that is greek to language that is so near the language of life that ono never thinks of the word as a word at all thus being diverted from the talebut only as a symbol this is a point which in these days of  stylists  deserves and demands to be emphasised our praise for my brother is unusual but the book is unusual it has qualities for which the reviewer of novels has almost ceased to look and above all it has understanding and compassion we can point to writers who have comprehension and no pity and to writers who are sympathetic yet uninitiated mr brown has the double endowment and thus equipped and faithful to his art he has given us a living beautiful thinga story great in conception powerful in execution and distinguished by that tenderness which comes only from strong thinkers who have abode in though wilderness,northamerica_contra

  never say die by the grand duke michael michaelowitch collier such vogue as is secured for this story must be due to the rank and position of its writer the hero who is the fourth son of the prince of donnerwetter is hated by his mother and loved by his father he falls in love with a young lady of the court to whom his mother objects is banished and finally marries an englishwoman the tale is bare crude almost schoolboyish in its language the difficulties and trials of royal rank lend themselves to subtle and effective treatment as in anthony hopes book  the kings mirror but they demand talents which the present author does not show in the pages before us,northamerica_contra
  lhovel lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its author has so far given us,northamerica_contra
  the man and the moment by elinor glyn duckworth  co 6s mrs glyns latest heroine differs alike from elizabeth of the visits and caroline the passive victim of a didactic godmother she represents in fact a throwback to the  doormat type of midvictorian fiction and both she and her masterful admirer seem strangely out of place in a world which at present has little use either for supermen or sentimentalists the story though not overpossible is ingenious enough in its construction and breathes an atmosphere of saccharine amiability contrasting oddly with the authors earlier work,northamerica_contra
  days spent on a doges farm this book perhaps need never have been written certainly it never need have been printed many however will read or at least skim its shallow pages and doubtless those will echo its praises most obediently who are first to fling it aside one cannot escape from the feeling that to plod through it is somehow a tribute to the authors father the late mr j a symonds to whom none of us can afford to be ungrateful for is there one who can honestly say that he has gleaned nothing from the harvest of the laborious historian of the renascence mr symonds judgement was however sometimes at fault never perhaps more so than when he sanctioned and even urged the publication of this work it consists of or more probably is based on passages from a desultory and impressionist journal intended for his amusement and on his daughters return his indulgence for her high spirits may well have been fortified by parental pride in the many promising features of her writing we are told that he  laughed at the crudities which he forgave that his  marks are over all the manuscript and that he intended to compose for it an historical introduction this project was defeated by his death for his sake we would rather believe that he would have revised recast and severely pruned for publication a manuscript that as an artless con fidential communication was harmless enough nay not with out its charms and graces but which says so little for the taste of the writer or the judgement of her censor it is indeed painful to decide who is responsible for so deplorable a breach of manners as is involved in the third chapter to say nothing of other errors that the authoress could and sometimes indeed does write pleasantly and effectively we do not deny but here she is working on bad principles and working carelessly lazily and erratically the subject is rather a promising one george sand would have handled it to perfection all that miss symonds has to say of value or interest she might have said in ten or at most twenty pages the rest is made up of endless repetitions trivial incidents and remarks superficial descriptions and rarely successful attempts at fine writing but its oddest feature is the tendency to literary practical joking the writer is always preparing us for something tremendously novel and interesting and then putting us off with the most ridiculous of mice take her chapter on the  flowers of the plain these turn out to be the usual habitants of our english ditches but our hopes revive as we read  the wonder of the flora appears in the first weeks of july it is the convolvulus rightly the americans have called that flower the morning glory but in spite of enthusiastic description it turns out that the only species are the two common english bindweeds surely the american morning glory is the annual ipomoea which our gardeners call convolvulus major again the real name of the village is vescovana its fancy name groomboolia is borrowed from a novel even the doges farm is a pious fraud no doge ever came there or lived there at all i must she says openly acknowledge that the title of doges farm was bestowed more for the sake of its new and pleasing sound than for any historical fitness in the term this however was the doing of the proprietress and miss symonds has merely adopted the attractive title for her bookcover not very much at least not too much has been written about the rarely visited euganean hills and the broad alluvial plain at their feet a consummate artist could have made a beautiful little book about them truly there is not very much to say about a region whose charm is its impressive monotony but all that is said should be in strict keeping the traveller should be alone or suppress his uncongenial companions he may describe the scenery as subjectively as he likes but he must maintain a mood in harmony with it now miss symonds has undoubtedly caught the spirit of such scenes and represents it not seldom as effectively as mr stevenson in his  inland voyage but unfortunately she mars the effect by careless selection by irrelevance and by the usual tourist facetiousness hence the meagreness of the book is only too apparent in fact to treat such a subject successfully requires firstrate talent and ripe expe days spent on a doges farm by margaret symonds fisher unwin rience you want to give the impression of breadth and monotony without being monotonous yourself you can not give it by perpetually repeating your sky effects and colour ecstasies as we have hinted out of the 250 pages of fine large print one could piece together about twenty or so of more or less permanent value the agricultural operations the buildings and the oxen are fairly sketched and on the whole one comes away with a more or less distinct impression of what vescovana is like in spite of the mystification and practical joking miss symonds little sketches also help one a good deal some are very pleasing but the botanical drawings are unsatisfactory miss symonds satire however demands a serious protest harmless enough in a private letter surely in print it is in bad taste if not offensive she more than once passed a considkrable time as a guest at the doges farm enjoying the princely if rather theatrical hospitality of its mistress she now holds up that unfortunate lady to public ridicule not even keeping back her name true she dwells also upon her excellent pointsher business capacity her versatile accomplishments and her munificence but the general fortrait is that of a clever parvenue driven crazy by an aristocratic marriage and by having her own way miss symonds hostess is it seems an englishwoman who married a venetian gentleman who was attempting to repair the fortunes of his house by farming on modern principles it seems the countess has the carts painted with his title  almoro the third though we gather from miss symonds that almoro iii flourished in the fifteenth century as a landlady and a farmer the lady has been very successful but as a countess she must be a burlesque if we are to believe what we read i prefer not to believe it there may or may not have been a doge in the familywhat venetian is not descended from a doge but the doges caps all over the house and even on the ladys hairpins are too shocking this comical portrait recalls thackerays princess de moncontour nee higg only it is more florid and eccentric the chapter called  first impressions under pretence of the confusion of mind caused by arrival at groomboolia gives a burlesque account of the ladys person conversation manners or rather lack of manners her ridiculous garden her flighty housekeeping and in short her general craziness aghast at this chapter with its wild and exaggerated descriptions of places and persons and indignant at the exposure of a hostess by her guest we turn to the next called  second thoughts which positively begins  the above description is not of course to be taken for a reality or for anything final any more than mark twains  tramp abroad  the authoress seeing she has gone too far thinks well to put in this caveat but she soon drops the point without explaining how much of her statements she wishes us to believe the most offensive certainly admit of no explanationeither they are true or they are false here and there later on there are hints which seem to confirm them thus then we are reluctantly forced to believe that miss symonds having very excusably made fun of her hostess in letters to her father is now so illadvised as to print these playful animadversions there is however a possible alternative namely that miss symonds feels sure that the eccentric queen of groomboolia is by no means averse to having her eccentricities advertised still it would perhaps have been as well to reserve them for her obituary we must add that the book is beautifully got up and contains promise of much better and more serious work in the iuure y y  bays spent on a doges farm by margaret symonds fisher unwin miss margaret symonds is altogether her fathers daughter and at every turn of the page she recalls the lamented author of the italian renaissance she has the same quick eye for picturesque form the same sensitive feeling for colour the same minuteness which is not quite convincing and the same naive and confidential egotism these qualities and defects of qualities are not so strongly developed in miss symonds nor are they set off by her fathers wealth of eclectic erudition but to them her book owes its genuine charm this is the less surprising because it was as she tells us written for him and under his influence and he had promised her an introduction  in which he was going to deal in particular with virgils connexion with lombard scenes mr j a symonds was indeed actually on his way to the doges farm where he hoped to write the preface when he fell ill he died in rome shortly afterwards and now she says  what i have written seems incompletea thing with though spirit gone out of it but my fathers marks are all over the manuscript and because he liked the book and took an interest in it and wanted me to print it i do so now and give it back to him an unmistakably pathetic meaning is thus given to the lines from the daisy placed underneath the dedication  o love we two shall go no longer to lands of summer across the sea the book is in effect an album of pen and pencil sketches made at vescovana on the estate of an english lady residing in the basso padovano the ladys husbandshe is now a widowbelonged to the pisani one of the famiglie nobili of venice who in the last century conferred a doge on the republic these nobles spent most of their time in the city of the lagoon and most of their money on their venetian palaces so that these country houses were greatly neglected the pisani doge never in fact came to vescovana and the title of doges farm has as the writer characteristically acknowledges been bestowed more for the sake of its new and pleasing sound than for any special historical fitness the country is like so much of lombardy simply reclaimed marsh and its fertility represents though lives and labour of many generations of contadini across it runs the adige not the noble blue river that swirls joyously through the piles of the scala bridge at verona but a breadth of sullen water moving between high banks and on the high bed of alluvium brought down from the alps  these banks are calculated to inspire something like panic in the mind of the ignorant observer they rise to a height of from twentysix to twentynine feet above the level of the land and the church spires and houses which once commanded are now shadowed by these mountainous banks standing on their summit you see the entire plain for miles spread like a map below you interminable fields of corn or maize stretching between ditches hedged by mulberry and willow with here and there a mud hut or a stable now and then a small thin campanile lu the far background faint shadows of the alps arise and on the breeze a suspicion of saltair is born from the invisible lagoon in the heart of this country lies vescovana whither in 1850 the english contessa came to a desolate home the family had before lived on the ground floor in the fine old palatial drawing rooms the linen hung on lines among the family portraits pigs wandered through the iron gates the threshing floors were before the diningroom windows hardly a tree or a flower was in sight but one curious remnant of greatness remaineda lions head carved ia marble by the door and under it the words bocca delle denoncie segrete though political espionage of the council of ten transferred to the petty jealousies of the paduan farm now all is changed there is a garden filled with tall chestnuts and catalpas grass and flowers cover the threshing floor paths wind among syringa hedges and tamarisks line the edges of the moat a longtailed tit builds in the bocca delle denoncie segrete and the lions mouth is filled with down not less wonderful are the improvements in the land on though farm and in the great grey cattle whoso beauty makes miss symonds justly enthusiastic the story of the transformation which is due solely to the energy of the countess is told with great spirit and the picture of this lady at once so unusual and so admirable a figure was well worth the painting for her the mass waits on sundays she orders physic to the sick oxen she fixes the day for the harvest though hour for the admission of the gleaners and all this intensely modern activity has for setting or background a peasant life which structurally is altogether mediaeval nothing however gives so profound an impression of her commanding personality as the story of the saving of the fields during the great floods of a few years back we ought to say that though we are not left in much doubt as to the actor who plays the part of the dca cc mach ina the authoress forbears to state positively that it was the contessa pisani miss symonds must be allowed to recount this moving incident in her own words   it had poured and poured with rain for many days and always it went on pouring up in the alps the torrents had broken loose and were hurling down their floods and boulders over the meadows  the adige was swollen yellow ghastly  but still by its banks restrained a dread aud a terror was in though minds of the people on the plain they went up in the evening to though top of the banks and looked then they crept down for a shudder passed through them  and still it poured  at midnight a gig rattled up to the gates of a lonely villa on the plain   though river has broken on the rovigo side suid though man inside  though people are mad they are coming across to open our lock and let the flood into our land as well as their own its a horrible flood but why should both sides perish r the lady of the villa arose she ordered her horses and she drove through the dark and the blinding rain at dawn she stood on thu banks of the adige beside her lock she was a woman but she stood thero alone and  shoot then shoot she cried to the men on the opposite bank of the river  they were all there half mad with fear they had their guns pointed at her but they didnt shoot and the flood went over their land and not over hers not less graphic is the account of the fire on the podere and of the contessa  in her gorgeous evening dress held up over a still more gorgeous petticoat storming at the crowd collectively and individually and then manipulating the hose with her own fair hands while all around the millions of frogs sang on and above was  such a heaven of quiet and indifferent stars no one can be more sensible to the beauty of the plain than miss symonds but she seems still more impressed with its melancholy the houses are clean the people are sober and thrifty without much beauty indeed except for the womens hair but all of them possessing she says  that charm of lithe and easy motion which is so hopelessly lacking in the mountaineer perhaps though the question of race has something to say to this for some of the mountain folk of the venetian tyrolareconspicuously graceful but any how at vescovana she noted th at even at the joyous harvest time they were sad and their very songs seemed weighted with misery she mentions too the frequency of suicide and quotes the explanation given of a suicidal youth who did not care to live because  there is never anything new the malady du sikle seems to have overtaken these poor peasants with a vengeance when they court death on such grounds miss symonds attributes it to the monotony of their lives the immense ennui of the great green seathe waveless plain of lombardy we are inclined to think that the vera causa is simply endemic fever miss symonds is to be congratulated on the success with which the local colour is suggested in these rough but spirited sketches they are all full of true southern warmth and appeal to us here with particular force whore every fresh winter makes us feel how right that savant was who said that england

  the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity

pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,northamerica_contra

  the californians reviews by gertrude atherton lane it is always with a flash of surprise that on laying down a novel by mrs atherton we realise how good it has been she really has all the faults her philosophical and critical jargon is hopelessly out of place and her chorus of girls with their frocks and their eyes are quite as vulgar as she intends and she has never learned how to write style she says with unconscious irony  style alone will give you a place in letters worth having but style is a land unknown to mrs atherton it is not for want of trying she  wordpaints conscientiously and strenuously and she clangs on every critical nerve consider this once she rode to the foothills escorted by dick they were covered with yellow and purple lupins miniature jungles which harboured nothing more sanguinary than the gopher and the cottontail the tawny poppies had hills all to themselves a blaze of colour as fiery as the sun to which they lifted their curved drowsy lips the mariposa lilies grew by the creeks in the dark shade of meeting willows the goldgreen moss was like plush on tile trees from the hills the great valley looked like a dense forest out of which lifted the tower of an enchanted castle not another signal of man was to be seen nothing but the excrescence on the big weddingcake house of a bonanza king beyond the hills rose the slopes of the mountains with their mighty redwoods their dark untrodden aisles their vast primaeval silences how it jars the ugliness of that plush upon the trees the grotesque discord of that confectionery simile nor has mrs atherton any more notion of structure than of ornament in fiction she has that terrible habit of beginning at the beginning the substance of the californians for instance consists in the varying relations of one man with two girls friends he falls in and out of love with each of them in turn and there is a good deal of play of temperament upon temperament a good deal of emotional crisis in the process this is all well enough but to get to this you have to work through a hundred pages of local colour and if you please a biography from childhood of the two young ladies in question all because mrs atherton does not know how to set the puppets working without it it was just the same in patience sparhawk it was just the same in american wives and english husbands tolerable the first time the device becomes irritating by repetition and yet when all is said and done mrs athertons are good novels you  pish  and  pshaw  for a while and then you feel that she is getting a hold on you her people are vigorously conceived and what is more they are interesting and they grow develop under circumstances furthermore she has an undeniable power of creating strong situations here is an example helena has taken magdalenas lover from her and after a short engagement throws him over she comes to tell magdalena that she has found him to he a man with an impure past magdalena knew this the knowledge the womans desire to save had been an element in her love for him her nerves are overwrought to the point of trying to kill her friend helena paused abruptly and caught her breath she had felt magdalena extend her arm and stealthily open a drawer in the bureau beside her chair there was nothing remarkable in the fact for in that drawer magdalena kept her handkerchiefs nevertheless helena shook with the palsy of terror the cold sweat burst from her body in the intense darkness she could see nothing only a vague patch where the face of magdalena was the silence was so strained that surely a shriek must come tearing across it the shriek came from her own throat she leapt to her feet like a panther reached the door in a  bound fled down the hall and the stair her eyes glancing wildly over her shoulder and so out to her horse it is many years since that night but there are silent moments when that ride through the woods flashes down her memory and chills her skinthat mad flight from an unimaginable horror through the black woods on a terrified horse the shadow of her fear racing just behind with outstretched arms and clutching fingers helenas sudden flight left magdalena staring through the dark at the spanish dagger in her hand her arm was raised her wrist curved the dagger pointed toward the space which helena had filled a moment ago i intended to kill her she said aloud i intended to kill her thisand this is only one of two or three equally strong scenes in the californiansstrikes us as really dramatic with a writer of less true instinct it would have been melodramatic but mrs atherton knows magdalena the spanish blood in her the starved life she led outside her love for the sinner make her and her act plausible throughout she is a

has had opportunities of getting good information and certainly she possesses a vivid imagination and a vigorous and fearlessly modern style a study in constitutional dipsomania is not new and not agreeable but it is most cleverly worked out in 4a daughter of the vine and what is more important the interest of the story commences at once 4 tyre californians con tains more detail and is altogether a more elaborate piece of work among women who have written american novels mrs atherton probably holds a position hardly contested by any rival there are however a good many modern english women novelists with whose method and style hers might be compared she secures an advantage over these ladies in the novelty and picturesqueness of the life and scenery with which she deals she is always vivacious and clear she can be sentimental without being mawkish but she seems unable to add the touch of delicacy and tenderness with which a great writer heightens the effect of his most vigorous studies from human nature in concentration of effect 4 a daughter of the vine shows an advance on 4 the californians it is a pity that the authors determination to be trenchant at all costs has led her in the later book to a conclusion which is almost brutal excessive length both of narrative and dialogue goes far to limit the interest of a passing emperor by robert shortz routledge  sons it is a story of life first at the united states military college at west point and afterwards when the hero and his comrade have been expelled in mexicoduring the days of the archduke maximilian otherwise the emperor maximiliano both sections of the book show the same lack of proportion in dealing with matters of detail and the whole volume amounts to little more than a wild story of adventure unsuited to boys as literature solely because there is a want of delicacy nearly amounting to impropriety in various places fighting and military movements are described with the same care and interest that appear in the same writers story of the days of napoleon in italy entitled  the gift of bonaparte the author in question now and then uses phraseology which stamps his writing as transatlantic 44the governors expected visit did not materialize your intentions were good though they did not materialize are instances that occur in narrative and dialogue respectively the story is told mostly in the first person by the hero a cadet of the united states army and a campaigner in mexico and the form of narrative adopted is not always successfully maintained we do not think the book ranks high as fiction though it gives promise of more interesting work mrs marshalls place as a writer of tales for the young is vacant and one may reasonably suppose that miss julia dorr aspires

should be considered a reproach to call a novelist sentimental and a compliment rather than otherwise to call him or her impassioned novels are supposed to be chiefly valuable as representations of different varieties of human nature and sen timent is as real an element in human nature as passion and perhaps a rather more common one so that it might seem to have at least an equal right to representation the source of the prejudice is to be found probably in a vague but not quite baseless belief that sentiment is more likely in pro portion than passion to find an unreal or false expression the representation of passion is subject to control or verification by the necessity of giving a credible account both of the person by whom the passion is felt and of the object by which it is inspired for it is only when both these are made clearly conceivable that the relation between them or the passion itself appears real and natural to the spectator if the circumstances described are those which in real life would stir deep emotions to which the characters in the romance appear insensible the work is commonly sensational if on the other hand the writer succeeds in representing men and women in considerable agitation of mind without provocation or upon pro vocation which would naturally induce a different kind of agitation from that exhibited the work may be called sentimental as fairly as if it had been deliberately intended for a representation of sentiment which is simply passion unattached a disposition to feel strongly about something or other with a degree of obtuseness as to the comparative claims of the different things about which human beings are supposed to be capable of feeling to excite the sentiment which the author chances to be able most easily to re produce iu two liftle wooden shoes ouida as usual does not get beyond a kind of sentimentalism which is however sufficiently effective to make it worth while to ask why on reflection the effect is always felt to be tricky and unsatisfactory the reason we inmagine is that the author aims directly at exciting in her readers the sentiment which she conceives to be appropriate to the situation always the same which she pre fors to treat instead of representing the situation itself with such commanding truth and power as to ensure a response of some kind even in readers who may take a different view of the situation from herself the consequence is that the situation is never realised at all even by the author and that which is realised by her and more or less effectively communicated to a con genial reader is a sentiment wandering at large amongst impossible occasions and therefore never more than half true tolifeand nature in the present instance the sentiment to be communicated is one of ianguidly reproachful acquiescence in the order of nature which causes a dreamy little flowergirl to come to an untimely end like one of her own rosebuds or as the author puts it having confidence enough in the theory to lay it down with epigrammatic generality m men are true children and women are their rosebuds now ouida notwithstanding a genuine fondness for children which is one of the pleasantest traits in her writings has never made the discovery that a healthy child is the most unsentimental of beings exactly because all its experiences are concrete and particular and if she had further been able to believe that in this respect the child is generally father to the man her heroes would have less of the appearance of being created a priori as the purely ideal correla tives of a natural disposition on the part of flowergirls and novelists to be very much inpressed by what they do not understand lady novelists especially are apt to imagine that they are realists as soon as they have 1 summoned up courage to disregardor i better still to invertthe oldfashioned rules of poetic justice but it is evident that something more is needed to complete the i portrait of a sinner than an assurance on i the last page of his impenitence and im  punitythough this may be true and plau x sible enough as far as it goes ouida however i never knows anything more of her heroes than  that they are very wicked very clever very t handsome and cause a great many flower c girls and others to drown themselves for t love of those superlative qualities but the f latter part of the process which the novelist  describes is not reckoned amongst the evii dence of the heros diabolical fascination  and craft because the sentiment of fatal awe a and admiration which attends his steps prei supposes a magic in his presence quite apart 3 from anything he can be made to do or say  on the stage in one way the present volume gains in veracity by its slightness be cause flamen a luxurious artist who wishes to paint a gretchen is not in evidence long enough to display qualities actively incompatible with the sentiment of which he is the shadowy object but then as his loyal worshipper b6beewho wears her little wooden shoes into holes by walking from brussels to paris when she hears he is illis something of a genius as well as a good and industrious little girl it is hardly fair to suppose her to be fascinated by a lay figure without any individuality at all the scenes descriptive of the quaint fancies and lonely businesslike life of the pretty young orphan amongst friendly villagers before flamen lends her paul and virginia are pleasantly drawn but as we advance the style becomes senti mental in the same vicious sense as the matter and meaningless refrains with a pathetic sound are used at intervals as a kind of warning that these are the places where it is desirable to feel as tearful as possible a good deal of sound virtuous indignation has been expended we cannot but think unnecessarily in denouncing the moral tendency of the fictions of this author and her school an admiring critic in the revue des deuv mlondes who gives ouida credit for a daring imagination rare in this country quotes her as silencing prudish objections by the assurance je n6cris pas pour les femmes jecris pour les militaires in which we should be tempted to see a piece of profound cynical selfcriticism if the slightest touch of humour in her works would allow us to suppose that she is herself not altogether imposed upon by the heroes who are probably admired by no living x men except perhaps very young officers in x regiments of higher social than literary i repute however this may be the little  wooden shoes will certainly not do any i harm to any one who does not make the x mistake of thinking the writing really fine i whilst anyone who is capable of making a such a mistake deliberately must have a 1 mind too impervious to literary influences i to be in much danger of suffering moral x deterioration from anything in print i mr robert turner cottons ideal of mas e culine perfection has much in common with e that of ouida but perhaps out of regard to i the degeneracy of the age he displays it less i crudely and as it were symbolically he s has a generation of young men who are t comparatively possible and prosaic but they  have a few surviving ancestors who in their r youth fought duels drank gambled and v made love on an heroic scale while towering r above the heads of even these distinguished f persons there appears the real hero mr a carington who arranged for them whom c they should shoot marry disinherit or d otherwise provide for while he was himself f4 too distinguished even to condescend to take r part in those

the silliest of the season and generally de lrived amusement from it perhaps mr cotton was not uninfluenced by this pecu liarity of his hero in writing what is more like a burlesque upon ordinary novels than a lserious attempt to achieve something more imaginative than even mr mortimer collinss tranemigration it is true that both these iworks are supposed to have really but one i author under different names the chief i reason being that in both all the characters have a habit of eating lobsters with enthusiasm at all hours of the day or night and that in both the poetical mottoes which abound are taken from the comedy of dreams which we gather to be an unpub lished trilogy in which things earthly and celestial do their best to look as if they were standing on their heads but have some difficulty in keeping in recognisable shape because they are released from obedience to the laws of gravitation as well as from the minor canons of probability we believe there are some people besides mr carington who do find novels amusing in which a great many things happen for no reason in particular and every one talks animatedly and with an air of deep con viction about nothing who prefer in fact a magic lantern to dissolving views and both to a panorama mr carington may be read without the sustained mental effort requisite to follow for instance a cunningly devised plot of mr wilkie collins and yet it con tains if possible more of marvel and mystery in the same space because none is wasted upon explanatory details or futile attempts to fill in the missing links of causation there is a russian prince who is so very wicked that nobody but mr carington can keep him in order and there is a russian secret society of which the late emperor napoleon iii was the headit is impossible to guess why as the final cause of the society seemed to be a desire to do something rather dreadful as soon as it could settle what to the russian prince the foreign office of course knows nothing about all these transactions till they are explained to a discreet subordinate by mr carington who we are given to under stand puts an extinguisher on the society by carrying off into cumberland and marrying to a friends son the italian lady who acts as the emperors second and aidedecamp it does not appear that the love and con spiracy  have any thing more to do with each other than is implied in the business of both being looked after at the same time by mr carington if we had to choose we should on the whole give the preference to the conspiracy half of the production for mr cottons ladies are nearly as bad as ouidas men though to do him justice he is content with traducing their manners and introduces no immorality to speak of that is less than fifty years old one young lady who we are told is a comical imitation of a stage chambermaid answers sufficiently well to the description but the real heroine elinor for whom the author professes unbounded reverence and admiration does not succeed in so demeaning herself as to make his boisterous assurances that she is the perfection of noble grace and gentle breeding appear as impertinent as such express statements would do if made concerning the absolute perfection of womanhood to say that the ideal lady is perfect shows a want of faith in the selfevidence of her perfections but to praise her in so many words for being ladylike is a positive insult or a confession of innate vulgarity for it is not more mar vellous for the ideal to be innocent of pert ness which by the way she is not than of pocketpicking the hero of transmigration has three lives one to each volume of which the first and third are spent on earth and the second in the planet mars the gere ral result of which seems to be that wherever lobsters and pert nymphs of erratic habits may be found man may enjoy moments of contentment but that for solid durable happiness it is necessary to be a schoolboy subject to flogging the book is not amusing because the author tries to play with his fancies before they are full grown and seems not to be quite sure but what if they were allowed to grow they might develop into a serious contribution to philosophy still the second volume is the least tiresome of the three though we cannot commend the modesty of this new dante who summons the great estese from the shades to act as his guide philosopher and friendly codevourer of lobsters the change of planet however seems to have moderated the length as well as the depth of the coleridgian harangues the chronicle of the ferniors is a chapter of domestic romance from the last century with the scenery carefully got up from contemporary memoirs and correspondence but the only justification for the second part of the title horace walpole itn love seems to be the assumption that horaces way of being in love would be to give no signs of the fact until the lady appeared to favour some other suitor in which case he would begin to satirise her mother there are no means of disproving the first part of the hypothesis but the second seems to prove too much for horace walpole can scarcely have been in love with the daughters of all the ladies of whom he has something spiteful to say in his correspondence the author scarcely succeeds in showing that he took more interest in lady sophia fermor than in any other famous beauty who was expected to marry one lord lord lincoln for love and was consoled for her dis appointment by the elderly but illustrious premier lord carteret there is an anachronism in some of the political wisdom which the duke of newcastle is supposed to bestow on his nephew lincoln who is to be consoled for the loss of sophia by the prospect of the government of ireland which has the advantage observes his grace of requiring neither skill nor knowledge it may be doubted whether the idea that skill or knowledge might be expected by a troublesome population from their rulers had so far taken shape in the ducal mind of the period as to be worth noticing even as a fallacy edith slmcox  two little wooden shoes two little wooden shoes a sketch by  onida author of  chandos under two flags c london  chapman and hall grotesqueness and vivid colouring the latter not always very carefully laid on are the prominent features of the later works of  ouida in the outset of her career and for some time afterwards she devoted herself to undisguised sensuality and the world was not a little startled in the nineteenth century to meet with a woman whose views of life were something more advanced than those of a pagan her language was not perhaps so objectionable as that of mrs aphra behn but her heroes and heroines were quite as impassioned the novelty to some extent wore off though the author cannot yet rid herself of that grossness which marked her former productions we know her theory of existence tolerably well by this time wines choice viands and animal passions are the gods of her idolatry the end of life is not to prove oneself worthy of it but to enjoy itnot utterly to destroy the intellect but to exercise it upon inferior objects and overlay all the solemnity of being with epicureanism and carnality the reflection is not a very pleasant one that books upon which such teaching is unmistakably stamped should attain wide popularity though we have as a setoff the confidence equally pronounced and unmistakable that this popularity can only be ephemeral time will ruthlessly sweep away into oblivion all the enticing trivialities of such writers as this in vain do we look through the numerous novels of  onida and their name is legion for some trace of an apprehension of the real dignity of man or woman save for the form in which it is enshrined humanity is bnt little superior to the beasts of the field like them man is to eat drink and enjoy and at the end of the farce their death is to be his likewise two little wooden shoes is in some respects an advance upon the previous stories of  ouida it is not so flushed with sensuous feeling nor is the expression so highflown but when we have diligently read it through we ask in amazement if this which has been put before us is all that the author has to offer touching the great realities of being she never gets beyond the rudimentary stage of existence her philosophy is sufficient only for children and dangerous for them and when the anal words of her story have been reached we find ourselves inquiring  what next   to tell a story well and with some degree of power is not all that is demanded of a novelist that were placing the art too low even through the garb of fiction man must receive something more than mere amusement but we suppose it is useless insisting upon this lesson as regards very many of our living novelists with a talent so inconsequent as  ouidas and one which is chiefly noticeable when describing the ecstasy of animal passion it is difficult to tell what to do we have the impression that but for these gleanings in forbidden fields her books would be miserable sustenance and therefore we are forced to the irresistible conclusion that it would have been better for her never to have written at all the owner of the  two little wooden shoes from which this story takes its name is one bebee a little peasant of brabant very poor and very bewitching when we first see her she has just completed her sixteenth year she dwelled in a little hut left to her by an old man who had adopted her illiterate to the last degree she is represented as never speaking without giving utterance to poetic thoughts and some of the sentences put into her mouth by the author we are constrained to say are really very beautiful bebee was in the habit of going to brussels to sell her flowers and was regularly to be seen under an awning fronting the maison du roi pursuing her avocations one day there came to her a strange customer in the form of a painter  he walked with an aey grace he was clad in picturelike velvets he had a beautiful poetic head and eyes like deep brown waters and a face like one of jordaens or rembrandts cavaliers this magnificent being was attracted by the beauty and artlessness of the peasant girl whilst she stood in awe of him the painter was called flamen but it was not his real name he had become famous in france at the age of twenty by painting a picture that brought paris to his feet he became still further famous by verses by plays by political follies and by social successes one year he wrote a witty political pamphlet that hurt where it was perilous to aim and he fled from the country a large portion of the story is occupied in detailing the gradual fascination which crept over bibles soul from her frequent interviews with the painter onida makes no scruple in telling us that he indulges the thought on several occasions of accomplishing her ruin but even his vicious soul is kept in check by her strong purity at length one morning he leaves her but promises to retain months pass on but he does not do so bebee hears that he is ill and travels on foot and in her little wooden shoes all the way from brussels to paris on arriving in that city she discovers his abode and rushing into his apartments to attend upon him in his sickness as she thinks she is appalled at the sight which meets her gaze we are not sure that we ought to quote  ouidas  description of this scene but a portion of it will serve to show that the author has not yet forgotten how to paint sensual pictures   she saw the dusky room as in a dream she saw him stretched on the bed leaning on his elbow laughing and playing cards upon the lace coverlet she saw women with loose shining hair and bare limbs and rubies and diamonds glimmering red and white she saw men lying about npon the couch throwing dice and drinking and laughing one with another beyond all she saw against the pillows of his bed a beautiful brown wickedlooking thing like some velvet snake who leaned over him as he threw down the painted cards upon the lace and who had cast about his throat her curved bare arm   with a great piercing cry she let the little roses fall and turned and fled at the sound he looked up and saw her and shook his beautiful brown harlot off him with an oath this passage does not occur in the mysteries of london but in a work published by a firm who have done immense service to literature and the novel is to be had by english ladies mothers and daughters  at all libraries though extract we must admit is one of a very rare kind in the book and we cannot help thinking that with whatever relish it may have been written by the author it has been inadvertently passed by the publishers the rest of the story is soon told bebee dies broken j hearted and the amorous painter keeps the little wooden shoes as a memento of one who loved him once this is i all the author has to say nothing high nothing lofty is  deduced the innocent and the beautiful dies and the j courttsane flourishes cleverly as it is written the novel is a fiasco as regards morals and is a step in the direction of the apotheosis of lasciviousness and vice thornton

  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed 6s john long smrs campbell praed is one of the most readable of the novelists of australian life to begin with she is more intelligible there is less slang in her books than is usual in australian novels so far as we remember no one in  the maid of tne river  cooks or boils a  bill whatever that mysterious article mav be in fact the only really unintelligible word which occurs in the book is humpy wvhat a  humps  is we have not the remotest idea but the rest of the book vould be intelligible to the rawest  new chum yet the whole atmosphere of the story is distinctively australian it is the work of one intimately acquainted with the country the local colour is real it is part of the book and not simply daubed on after a few months cursory studv the pljt is elementary it is the familiar story of the confiding girl and the fascinatin seducer and it suffers from the usual wieakness that ihe seducer is not sufficientiv seductive nuni destiac is a pathetic figure but her innocence is almost inconceivabbly childish and stewart the villain of the piece is such a heartless and repellent blackguard that we fail to understand nulnis preference for him lnfatuation of this kind is only explicable where there is real passion and mrs iraed is too far lacking il passion to make her heroines conduct convincing  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed john long this is another of the prolific authors australian tales and one of the best she has produced it has none of the improbability of her  fugitive anne and is more carefully and sincerely written than her last english story indeed it is a genuine and very painstaking piece of work the realism of which will at once be admitted by all who know anything of australian life we are chiefly concerned here not with the hazards and simple pleasures of the bush life which mrs campbell praed has often portrayed in the past but with the life of a young girl who after a childhood spent in pleasant circumstances upon her fathers station up country is taken to live in the colonys capital as the immediate result of the banks foreclosure upon her fathers station the father obtains an inferior government clerkship in the capital and thus our heroine after a youth spent amongst all the generous freedom of a squatters homestead is introduced to the somewhat squalid realities of life on an inadequate income in the poor quarter of a colonial city the authors picture of this phase of australian life u especially deserving of commendation life as she here depicts it is actually being lived in singlestoried weatherboard villas in all the poorer suburbs of melbourne and sydney it is a less squalid life perhaps than that led by equally needy people in england because it is somewhat less cramped and confined but it is squalid petty and unlovely the heroine is a commonplace character enough though not unpleasing while she is little more than a child her vanity and simplicity combined with her unusual prettiness mark her out as a victim of the unoriginal wiles of a handsome blackguard who boasts that he has royal blood in his veins the girls downfall is a stereotyped piece of fiction but as a young mother she adopts a course which is certainly unusual among heroines and successfully sues her betrayer for breach of promise all this is rather deftly managed and without serious disregard of the probabilities we are enabled to reach the sort of denouement which the majority of novelreaders have long ago pronounced to be the most fitting  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed long 6s mks campbell praed clearly gave her imagination a rest when planning her latest story and was content to follow a wellworn track which runs through some rather dreary country here is once more a beautiful innocent girl who rejects an honest mans love and yields to the florid attractions of handsome swaggering alexander stewart betrayed by a mock marriage she meets with the usual experience of scandal and desertion when for her childs sake she demands recognition as a wife the author does not hesitate to provide stewart with a legal wife shut up in a lunatic asylum nuni destiac is dismayed and the reader is sorry for other than sympathetic reasons the only variation upon the old theme is that at mrs stewarts death nuni brings an action for breach of promise the sort of revenge hardly consistent with her character and a departure from the tradition she had closely followed hitherto her numerous predecessors in misfortune were equally ready to die of a broken heart or to marry the patient lover in the background  they would have scorned to appeal to a jury there 13 vigour and individuality in several of the characters and the story is well told but as a whole it falls far below mrs praeds best work the bitterness and hopelessness that become part of the life of the struggling official class in leichardts town are almost too faithfully reflected in these pages it is not the first time that mrs campbell praeds australian stories have made us realise that all the gold of the diggings would not compensate us for living in leichardts townas she depicts it,northamerica_contra

  anima vilis a tale of the great siberian steppe by marya rodziewicz translated by s c de soissons jarrold like so much of what comes to us from her countrymen the work of this polish lady new to the englishspeaking public is of a melancholy cast antoni mrozowiecki is a young man of blameless manners yet from the cradle wherein he was defrauded of his patrimony to the moment when he is presented to us reduced by the hazard of the road to his last halfpence upon his way to the siberian village of lebiaza he is ever the football of malignant destiny in the house of his host he is still pursued by illluck  at every turn he finds himself in a false position his honesty discredited his most hopeful enterprises turned to shame and ridicule his benefactor is driven to doubt his honesty and presently he is haled to tobolsk for a murderer finally within twelve hours of his marriage he is overwhelmed with his marya by a blizzard so that the despondent exclamation of his good friend audryanek even if we find them they will be frozen how unfortunate my poor friend ishas the effect by its very inadequacy of comic relief here however is the end of his troubles marya can predict  antoni it is our last misfortune and he liturgically may reply  thank god  for such immunity is attributed by siberian superstition to him who has cheated the blizzard but the strange communitythe weird land antonis host is a doctor of medicine who buys and sells oxen and millinery furnishes dramshops with liquor and peddles scythes through the countryside when the black eightmonths winter has broken down before a sudden breath out of the asiatic desert  within two days the steppe was black in five it showed signs of life in a week it was green in the melting of marya the intelligent reader may easily trace an analogy to this change of the season  i never said anything about it to anyone she said thoughtfully  but it bas always seemed to me that this perpetual martyrdom this longiog which must be overcome has made me wicked i think that one to whom it is forbidden to love his own country cannot love anything such a man or woman does not attain his full growth he does not blossom but becomes driedup stubble     do you know that there are some days when one is afraid to touch a knife      of the natives she asks   have you not noticed that they never laugh heartily  they are never merry without vodka this country stunts the human mind already when she has become so communicative the first warm breath has blown upon her soul presently she softens altogether and blossoms like a peach on the sombre brown of the story miss rodziewicz is a writer of power and intensity of vision the translator however can hardly be said to have done her justice  anima vilis a tale of the

sienkiewicz we take him to be an american in spite of his french name from the many americanisms which his translation contains in the preface he furnishes a quaint account of how he fared in russia on his first visit to that country and he explains why mlle rodzewicz the author whose tale he translates still remains in maiden merititltr faucjfiee the tale itself is somewhat lacking in plot it describes the adventures of a young pole in siberia who is engaged in trade there falls in love with a certain pan na marya his employers daughter and marries her when a dangerous rival named shumskihas luckily been killed by a private enemy perhaps the best things in the book are the descriptions eg of the fairs the great slaughterings of sheep are vigorously told but do not make pleasant reading the snowstorm in which the young married couple are on the point of perishing is realistically described the slavs are adepts at this knd of thing as witness the snowstorm in pushkins captains daughter and that in though poem of nekrasov  red nosed frost moroz krasni nos in which poor darya perishes it is to be feared that certain of the russian words which the translator introduces into this volume will hardly pass muster eg tulub and balalaibaboth these forms occur several times there are some other incorrect expressions gyp is difficult indeed to translate but her people are almost invariably ladies and gentlemen and in  petit bob  all the characters come of this class the translation before us little bob by alys halford published by mr heinemann fails because a little vulgar in its language all the characters are made for example to use the unnecessary ever thus whatever does it matter to you    whatever makes you imagine that whatever do you mean these three and many others being put into the mouth of petit bobs grandfather who is a great gentleman petit bobs mother who is a lady starts in the same line   whoever has taught you to say that   and the abbe whose french is

  the cords of vanity by j branch cabell hutchinson  co though mr cabell borrows his title from isaiah the manner and tone of his story are exuberantly irresponsible from a literary standpoint he deserves admiration for he exhibits wit grace and cleverness in devising situations both comic and tragic and in making the most of them the narrative is ascribed to an american author who between two genuine experiences of love indulges in a series of triflings with the female heart in the course of which he infatuates the wife of a man called jasper jasper contributes to the evil savour of his name in fiction by murdering the friend of the narrator instead of the latter who behaves like a poltroon and is momentarily ashamed of himself viewed as a whole the book is a notable performance though the influence of oscar wilde is perceptible it is an influence on a mind which in mirth is naturally creative and has the strength to nourish its mirth with tragedy   ,northamerica_contra

containing the good things of town and conn try were piled about them while among the straw and litter the motherly hen scratched and clucked with their hungry broods at their heels instead of chaucers motley and splendid throng i only saw a group of waggoners and stableboys enjoying a circulating pot of ale while a longbodied dog sat by with head on one side ear cocked up and wistful gaze as if waiting for his turn at the tankard  notwithstanding this grievous decies sion however i was gratified at perceiving that the present occupants were not unconscious of the poetical renown of their mansion an inscription over the gateway proclaimed it to be the inn where chaucers pilgrims slept on the night previous to their departure and at the bottom of the yard was a magnificent sign representing them in the act of sallying forth 1 was pleased too at noticing that thpugh the present inn was comparatively modern yet the form of the old inn was preserved there were galleries round the yard as in old times on which opened the chambers of the guests to these ancient inns have antiquaries ascribed the present forms of our theatres plays were originally acted in innyards the guests lolled over the galleries which answered to our modern dresscircle the critical mob clustered in the yard instead ofthe pit and the groups gazing from the garret windows were no bad representatives of the gods of the shilling gallery when therefore the drama grew important enough to have a house of its own the architects took a hint for its construction from the yard of the ancient  hostel 9 i was so weil pleased at finding the6c remembrances of chaucer and his poem that 1 ordered my dinner in the little parlour of the talbot whilst it was preparing i sat at the window musing and gazing into

down through all the branches the squire in thc indulgence of his love of every thine that smacks of old times has held so many grave conversations with the parson at table about popular superstitions and traditional rites that they have been carried from the parlour to the kitchen by the likening doa etic and being apparently sanctioned by such high authority tiie whole house has become infected by i them  the servants are all versed in the common modes of try ing luck and the charms to ensure constancy they read their fortunes by drawing strokes in the ashes olby repeating a form of words and looking in a pail of water st marks eve i am told was a busy time with them  being an appointed night for certain mystic ceremonies several of them sowed hempseed v be reaped hy their true lovers and they even ventured upon the solemn iu fearful preparation of the dumbcake this must he done fasting and in silence 1 he ingredients are handed down in traditional form   an eggshell full of salt an eggshell full of malt and an eggshell full ol barleymeal  hen the cake is ready it is put upon a pan over tiie tire ancl the future husband will appear turn the cake and retire but if a word is spoken or a fast is broken during this awful ceremony there is no knowing what horrible consequences would ensue  the experiments in the present instance came to no result they that sowed the hempseed forgot the magic rhyme that they were to pronounce so the true lover never appeared  and as to the dumbictke what between the awful stillness they had to keep and the awfulness of the midnight hour their hearts failed them when they had put the cake in the pan  so that on the striking ol the great houseclock in the sei vantvhall they wt ic seized with  ycddcu panic and van c ci tooi  t tilm the

personage and rather idle she has more time to occupy herself with these matters she has always had her head full of love and matrimony she knows the dreambook by heart and is quite an oracle among the little girls ofthe family who always come to her to interpret their dreams in the mornings  during the present gaiety of the house however the poor girl has worn a face full of trouble  and to use the housekeepers words  has fallen into a sad hystericky way lately it seems that she was born and brought up in the village where her father was parish clerk and she was an early playmate and sweetheart of young jack tibbets since she has come to live at the hall however her head has been a little turned being very pretty and naturally genteel she has been much noticed and indulged and being the housekeepers niece she has held an equivocal station between a servant and a companion she has learned something of fashions and notions among the young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis insomuch that her finery at church on sundays has given mortal offence to her former intimates in the village this has occasioned the misrepresentations which have awakened the implacable family pride of dame tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a spice of coquetry in her disposition showed it on one or two occasions to her lover which produced a downright quarrel and jack being very proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back upon her for several successive sundays  the poor girl is full of sorrow and repentance and would fain make up with lier lover  but he feels his security and stands aloof in this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother who is continually reminding him what he owes to his family for this same family pride seems doomed to be the eternal bane ct lovers  as i hate to sec a pretty lace in trouble 1 have felt quite concerned for thc luckless phoebe ever since i heard i er story it is a sad thing to be thwarted rn love at any time but particularly so at this tender season of the year when every living thine even to the very butterfly is sporting with its mate and the green fields and the budding groves and the singing of the birds and the sweet smell of the howers are enough to turn the head of a lovesick girl i am told that the coolness of young readymoney p very heavy at poor phoebes heart instead of singing about the

advises phoebe to despise ail the men as heartily as she does but phoebes loving temper is not to be curdled she has no such thing as hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole composition she has all thc simple fondness of heart of poor weak loving woman and her only thoughts at present are how to conciliate and reclaim her wayward swain 1 the spells and lovecharms which are matters of sport to the other domestics are serious concerns with this lovestricken damsel she is continually trying her fortune in a variety of ways i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six wednesdays and three fridays successively having understood that it was a sovereign charm to ensure being married to ones liking within the year she carriesabout also a lock of her sweethearts hair and a ribbon he once gave her being a mode of producing constancy ina lover she even went so far as to try her fortune by the moon which has always had much to do with loverv dreams and fancies tor this purpose she went out in the night of the full moon knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the od traditional rhvme  i  all hail to thee moon all hail to thee 1 pray thee good moon now show to me the youth who my future husband shall be  when she came back to the house she was faint and pale and went immediately to bed the next morning she told the porters wife that she had seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow which she was sure was young tibbets  at any rate she had dreamed of him all night both of which the old dame assured her were most happy signs it has since turned out that the person in the jneadow was old christy the huntsman who was walking his nightly rounds with the great staghound  so that phoebes faith in the charm is completely shaken 9 a village politician  i am a rogue if i do not think i was designed for the helm of state  i am so full of nimble stiatagems that i should have ordered affairs and carried it against the stream of a faction with as much case as a skipper would laver  against the wind tue goblins  in one of my visits to the village with master simon he proposed that we should stop at the inn which he wished to show nie as a specimen of a real country inn the head quarters of village gossip i had remarked it before in my perambulations about the place it has a deep oldfashioned porch leading into a large hall which serves for taproom and travellersjoom  having a wide tireplace with high backed settles on each side where the wise men of the village gossip over their  e and hold their sessions during the j og v inter evening jhe uudloid i aa i easy indolent fellow shaped a little like one of his own beer barrels and is apt to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on one side n 1 his hands in his pockets whilst his wife and daughter attend to customers his wife however is fully competent to manage the establishment and indeed from long habitude rules over all the frequenters of the taproom as completely as if they were her dependants instead of her patrons not a veteran alebibher but pays homage to her having no doubt been often in her arrears i have already hinted that she is on very good terms with readymoney jack he was a sweetheart of hers in early life and has always countenanced the tavern on her account indeed he is quite the  cock of the walk at the taproom  as we approached the inn we heard some one talking with great voiubilityand distinguishing the ominous words  taxes  poors rates and  agricultural distress it proved to be a thin loquacious fellow who had penned the landlord up in one corner of the porch with his hands in his pockets as usual listening with an air of the most vacant acquiescence  the sight seemed to have a curious effect on master simon as he squeezed my arni and altering his course sheered wide of the porch as though he had not any idea of entering this evident evasion induced me to notice the orator more particularly he was meagre but active in his make with a long pale bilious face  a black beard so illshaven as to bloody his shirtcollar a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at the sides into a most pragmatical shape he had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction of mine host  at sight of master simon the landlord was evidently a little flurried and began to rub his hands edge away from his corner and make several profound publican bows while the orator took no other notice of my companion than to talk rather louder than before and with as i thought something of an air of defiance master simon however as i have before said sheered off from the porch and passed on pressing my arm within his and whispering as we got by in a tone of awe and horror  thats a radical he reads cobbelt  1 endeavoured to get a more particular account of him from my companion but he seemed unwilling even to talk about him answering only in general terms that he was  a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded trick of talking and was apt to bother one about the national debt and such nonsense9 from which 1 suspected that master simon had been rendered wary of him bv some accidental   rn encounter on the held of argument for these radicals are continually roving about in quest of wordy warfare and never so happy as when they can tilt a gentleman logician out of his addle  on subsequent inquiry my tupiciou have been cooirmed i find the radical has but recently found his way ioto the village where he threatens to commit fearful devastations with his doctrines he has already made two or taree complete converts or new lights he shake tiie faith of several others and hnartevously puzzled the brains of many of the oldest villagers who had never thought about politics or scarce any thing else during their whole lives  he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness of mind and body worrying about with newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has shocked several of the staunchest villagers by talk ing lightly of the squire and his family and hinting that it would be better the park should be cut up into small farms and kitchengardens or feed good mutton instead of worthless deer  he is a great thorn in the side of the squire who is sadly afraid that he will introduce politics into the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking community he is a still greater grievance to master simon who has hitherto been abie to sway the political opinions of the place without much cost of learning or logic but has been very much puzzled of late to weed out the doubts and heresies already sown by this champion of reform indeed the latter has taken complete command at the taproom ofthe tavern not so much because he has convinced as because he has outtalked all the old established oracles the apothecary with all his philosophy was as nought before him he has convinced and converted the landlord at least a dozen times who however is liable to be convinced and converted the other way by the next person with whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king master simon and the squire she now and thea comes out upon the reformer with all the fierceness of a catomouutain and does not spare her own softheaded husband for listening to what she terms such  lowlived politics what makes the good woman the more violent is the perfect coolness with which the radical listens ta her attacks drawing his face up into a provoking supercilious smile and when she has talked herself out of breath quietly asking her for a taste of her houicbreej the only person that is in any way a match for this redoubtable politician is readymoney jack tibbet who maintains his stand in the taproom in defiance of the radical and all his works jack is one of the most loyal men in the country without being able to reason about the matter he has that admirable quality for a tough arguer also that he never knows when he is beat he has half a dozen old maxims which he advances on all occasions and though his antagonist mav overturn them never so often yet he alwav brings them anew to the ricld he is like the robber in ariosto who though his head might be cut off half a hundred times yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling and returned as sound a man as ever to the charge whatever does not square with jacks simple and obvious creed he sets down for  french politics for notwithstanding the peace he cannot be persuaded that the french are not still laying plots to ruin the nation and to get hold of the bank of england the radical attempted to overwhelm him one day by a long passage from a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes in newspapers in reply he gave him one ofthe stanzas which he has by heart from his favourite and indeed only author old tusser and which he calls hisgolden rules  leave princes affairs undcscauted on and tend to such doings as stand thee upon  fear god and offend not the king nor his laws and keep thyself out ofthe magistrates claws when tibbets had pronounced this wilh great emphasis he pulled out a well lilied leathern purse took out a handful of gold and silver paid his score at the bar with great punctuality returned his money piece by piece into his purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned up  and then giving his cudgel a stout thump upon the tloor and bidding the radical  good morning sir  with the tone of a man who conceives he has completely done for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity out of the house two or three of jacks admirers who were present and had been afraid to take the field themselves looked upon this as a perfect triumph and winked at each other when the radicals back was turned  ay ay said mine host as soon as the radical was out of hearing let old jack alone  ill warrant hell give him his own 1  some of mr irvines sketches are much in the manner of the characters of theophrastus and the microcosmographia of bishop earl  we shall conclude for tiie present with

haunting the purlieus of the hall in spite of a positive interdiction of the squire they are part of a gang that has long kept about this neighbourhood to the great annoyance of the farmers whose poultryyards often suffer from their nocturnal invasions  the mention of this work reminds us of a hoax that has been played on some of the morning and country newspapers who have reprinted several of bishop earles characters as co pied from an old ms just discovered and northeast rr hf fore pridedln they are however in some measure patronised by the squire who considers the race as belonging to the good old times  which to confess the private truth seems to have abounded with goodfornothing characters this roving crew is called  starlight toms gang from the name of its chieftain a notorious poacher i have heard repeatedly ofthe misdeeds of this minion ofthe moon for every midnight depredation that takes place in farm or fold or farmyard is laid to his charge starlight tom in fact answers to his name he seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be traced in the morning bv the  mj mi mischief he has done he reminds me of that fearful personage inthenursery rhime  who goes round the house at night  none but bloody tom who steals all the sheep at night  none but one bv one  in shortstarlight tom is the scapegoat ofthe neighbourhood but so cunning and adroit that there is no detecting him old christy and the gamekeeper have watched many a night in hopes of entrapping him and christy often patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose but all in vain it is said that the squire winks hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feeling towards the vagabond because of wu being very expert at all kinds of games a great shot willi the crossbow and the best morrisdancer in the country  the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested about the skirts of his estate on condition that they do not come about the house the approaching wedding however has made a kind of saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension of all sober rule it has produced a great sensation throughout the female part of the household  hot a housemaid but dreams of wedding favours and has a husband running in her head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies  there is a public footpath leading across one part of the park by which they have free ingress and they are continually hovering about the grounds telling the servant girls fortunes or getting smuggled in to the young ladies  i believe the oxonian amuses himself very much by furnishing them with hints in private and bewildering all the weak brains m the house with their wonderful revelations the general certainly was j very much astonished by the communica i tions made to him the other evening by j the gypsy girl he kept a wary silence to j wards us on the subject and alfected to treat it lightly  but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his attentions to lady lillvcraft and her dogs  i have seen also phoebe wilkins thc  housekeepers pretty and lovesick niece holding a long conference with one of these old sybils behind a large tree in the avenue and often looking round to see that she was not observed 1 make no i doubt that she was endeavouring to get some favourable auzurv about the result of her lovequarrel with young ready money as oracles have ahvavs been more consulted on loveaffairs than upon anv thing else i fear however that in thinstance the response was not so ftvoura hie as usual for i perceived poor phoebe returning pensively towards the househer head hangingdown her hat in her hand and the ribbon trailing along the ground  at another time as i turned a corner of a terrace at the bottom of the garden just by a clump of trees and a large stone urn i came upon a bery of the young girls of the family attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was at a loss to comprehend the meaning of their blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation until i saw the red cloak of a gypsy vanishing among the shrubbery a few moments after i caught sight of master simon and the oxonian stealing along one of the walks of the garden chuckling and laughing at their successful waggerv having evidently put the gypsy up to the thing and instructed her what to say  after all there is something strangely pleasing in these tamperings with the future even where we are convinced of the fallacy of the prediction it is singular how willingly the mind will half deceive itself and with what a degree of awe we will listen even to these babblers about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry with these poor vagabonds that seek to deceive us into bright hopes and expectations i have always been something of a castle builder and have found my liveliest pleasures to arise from the illusions which fancy has cast over commonplace realities as i get on in life i find it more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful manner and i should be thankful to any prophet however false that would conjure the clouds which hang over futurity into palaces and all its doubtful regions into fairyland 9 the squire who as i have observed has a private good will towards gipsies has suffered considerable annoyance on their account not that they requite h indulgence with ingratitude for they do not depredate very flagrantly on his estate but because their pilfering and misdeeds occasion loud murmurs in the village 1 can readily understand the old gentlemans humour on this point i have a j great toleration for all kinds of vagrant j sunshiny existence and must confess i  take a pleasure in observing the ways ot j gipsies the english who are accustomed to them from childhood and often suffer from their petty depredations consider them as mere nuisances but i have been very much struck with their peculiarities i like to behold their dear olive complexions their romantic black eves their raven locks their lithe slender n gures and to hear them in low silver tones dealing forth magnificent promjjs of honours and estates of world s ean and ladies love     their mode of life too has sometime iii it very fanciful and picturesque they are the free denizens of nature and maintain a primitive independence in spite of law and gospel of county gaols and country magistrates it is curious to see this obstinate adherence to the wild unsettled habits of savage life transmitted from generation to generation and preserved in the midst of one of he most cultivated populous and systematic countries in the world they are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people about them they seem to be like the indians of america cither above or below tiie ordinary cares ami anxieties of mankind heedless of power of honours of wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations of

  the school for saints by john oliver hobbes fisher unwin this fantastic story by john oliver hobbes is absolutely different from the ordinary novel for it has no particular plot and the characters walk in and out in a delightfully inconsequential manner in fact it resembles a succession of brilliant scenes interspersed with reflections rather than a connected story among other things there is a good deal of roman catholic lore introduced robert orange the hero turns roman catholic and he and his friends discuss religion with some fervour but they never become tiresome about it or give the impression that they are preaching at the reader one feels that the conversations are introduced more from the authors exuberant joy in the subject than from any wish to proselytize the book resembles indeed in this characteristic and in the clearness with which the most subordinate characters are defined laurence oliphants 1 altiora peto a book like this one written by a brilliant writer evidently under the obsession of a very strong religious idea but even in the case of such an artistic writer as john oliver hobbes the weakness of introducing a pet subject is curiously illustrated where the subordinate characters are so good by the comparative failure of robert orange the hero and his lady brigit who produce almost all the roman catholic talking and writing they do not seem to live quite in the same way as reckage and his brother lord wight lady fitzreeves and that accomplished scoundrel purflete the hero and heroine are elusive they seem more minds than persons and this coldness and want of directness in their presentation seems due to thef actthatthey are used chiefly for the emission of the authors ideas butas we have hinted the author riots in a wealth of minor characters whose conversation and acts are most amusing and convincing real and imaginary people are mingled in a most eccentric fashion disraeli is introduced by name though it must be confessed he is rather disappointing and an english ambassador to paris is brought in under a very thin disguise and for many of the other characters actuality is suggested by footnotes or parentheses purporting to represent actual events but there is no vulgarity about it and none of them depends for its interest on any likeness fancied or real to actual persons then the plot itself is wild enough to satisfy the fantastic character of the actors we are whirled off from paris to an english byelection and thence to general prim and a carlist rising in spain reigning grand dukes and their agents intrigue mysteriously and purposelessly throughout the proceedings and altogether it is one of the most fascinating olia podrida we have met for some time at the end the author promises to continue the history of mr robert orange and if the second part is half as good as this it will be decidedly welcome  the school for saints a new period in john oliver hobbes literary career begins impressively in  the school for saints she has travelled far since  the gods some mortals and lord wickenham and there was need for that was an ugly story with a nauseating atmosphere and the air in this one is pure even to austerity from the first her habit of smartness has been tempered by an intellectual outlook but here mental energy dominates the book making it a storehouse of suggestive things brilliant things paradoxical things which the reader should by no means pass by breathless for the story for these things make all the worth of the volume intellect conviction a personal vision of life have stamped themselves on the pages but the story the characters hardly ever help and often hinder the effect as a book it is a brilliant chaos as a story it is a complete failure probably the writer had no intention of making a vivid and balanced plot but there is clear evidence she aimed at the achievement of living human portraits orange is a dreary fiasco he is the young ladys hero handsome aristocratic of ancient lineage dignified portentously solemn a model of piety chivalry and the manners of the high world perfectly inhuman and a consummate bore we have met him before in the pages of ouida but there we could laugh at him here we dare not for he is the mouthpiece of the most admirable sayings his creator endows him with her own literary aptitudes his gait and conduct are wearisomely  the school for saints part of the history of the right honourable robert orange mp by john oliver hobbes 6s unwin immaculate and his style in detached passages ascribed to him is delightful the heroine brigit is impossible bred in a convent she yet talks and acts and comports herself at seventeen with the aplomb the eloquence the skill the trained intellect of an unusually experienced woman of fifty that she is the granddaughter of an emperor does not explain this on one occasion we are allowed to see her as the child she must have been  oh take me away from these people they are stronger than i am and they frighten me i feel my weakness while i am with them i try to look bold and clever but my heart always trembles and i know that in the end no matter how well i fight i must lose the day i am like a small bird on a battlefield  here for once the young fluttering girl is near us then disraeli is a mere shadow so are the carlists hercy is quite unnecessary the fairly well conceived characters are the dull whig reckagebut how much better would he have been in trollopes hands and penste fitzreeves the sentimental kindhearted little fool who is cleverly suggested and who by a triumph of christian feeling is hardly ever made fun of english politics the carlist agitation and the strong refuge of the catholic church are the matters chosen to be welded there is a description of an election but the picture of the fight is blurred the escape from prims soldiers is hardly more vivid there is an enormous amount of undigested catholicity including a long description of the boxa mors ceremony introduced apparently because disraeli was once present but whether he slept or scoffed or was reverential we do not learn the obiker dida on politics on society and human nature are all stimulating all excellently expressed the catholic attitude to life is ably and brilliantly expounded these things are the reason for the books being the incidents are detached tawdry in arrangement never inevitable hardly visualised john oliver hobbes is always original and her latest book demands that you should skip the story and feed on the comments and reflections,northamerica_contra
  the worka of john m synge 4 vols dublin maunsel  co the publication of these volumes is an event of great importance and the fact that they appear without that preface by mr w b yeats which we had been led to expect throws a grave responsibility upon critics the poet who could have explained finely and faithfully the art and purpose of his friend is silent and it remains for reviewers to indicate as best they may the nature of synges achievement synge saw deeper than others not into the motives but into the significance of men and things that we think is the peculiar quality of his genius he reminds us oddly of gauguin for like that painter he sought amongst simple people to discover the significance of human life and came in his search to feel the mysterious solidarity of the universe he is an epic rather than a lyric poet he goes beyond the expression of particular and definite emotions to give a general sense of continuity and reality he has to make us believe in his vision and this he does by convincing us that his emotions are felt for a world more real than the world that is known to common men it is the  aran islands the third volume of this edition that reveals the dramatists sense of epic this volume is also to be regarded as the reliquary of his narrative style  for the fourtha collection of studies and sketchescontains a good deal of journalism that should never have been reprinted of the tourists and irishscholars who visit these islands few assuredly see what synge saw all that is superficial and quaint and pretty has been brushed away nature he rids of meretricious glamour and sham romance man and the universe confront each other without a single barrier of unreality between them only what is fundamental remains  and that is neither squalor nor brutality but the essential dignity of man and the awfulness of nature if synge is always in touch with the earth he touches it with wings  and surely the earth beneath him is a mountain top the loftiness of the regions to which we are transported is made manifest by a curious accident in describing an interior the author allows himself to use one or two rather commonplace expressions and to compare it with a picture probably he has a millet in mind the intrusion of this note of culture produces the same kind of shock that would be produced by an odious and unexpected piece of vulgarity in an ordinary book the reader is pitched suddenly from a world of impressive reality into that familiar world where worn counters are the current coin of expression and it requires a dozen pages of synges finest prose to lift him back into an atmosphere where prettiness and taste are irrelevant the medium in which the artist expresses his sense of this new world is itself new and superbly adequate it is simple sensuous musical english prose moulded in a celtic mind and spoken by celtic lips we take as an example a passage from  the playboy of the western world which will also serve to introduce another aspect of the authors genius  pegeen providence and mercy spare us all christy its that youd say surely if you seen him and he aftef drinking for weeks rising up in the red dawn or before it maybe and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of may and shying clods against the visage of the stars till hed put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows pegeen  and there was no one in it but the two of you alone  christy the divil a one though hed sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world and not a one of them to this day but would say their seven curses on him and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze maybe in the deadness of the night a man who has penetrated the web of accidents that hides one human being from another will be restless and unsatisfied till he has dived deep beneath the surface of nature and if he be an artist brought up to common light a handful of realities that strange confusion of shapes and colours and sounds and smells had for synge an essential unity also he felt that animate or inanimate all spin together on one planet great is the antagonism between man and man between man and nature greater but between fate and the universe greatest of all at worst men feel this in common they are all in the same rudderless boat at best they can read profound meanings in nature and feel with her subtle sympathies dan in the shadow of the glen turns his wife out of the house  the old vagabond she has sheltered bids her take heart there is a world out of doors let

off you and the light of your eyes but its fine songs youll be hearing when the sun goes up and therell be no old fellow wheezing the like of a sick sheep close to your ear the contrast between the smug security of a yeomans cottage and the fine life of the roads and commons is not greater than the contrast between the roads and commons of the fine writer and the motorist and this country discovered by the poets imagination but synge is most profound when he turns his emotional insight upon men and women in great and moving situations as a revelation of the logic of the heart the second act of deirdre is hardly surpassed the story is well known deirdre having overheard a conversation between her lover naisi and fergus emissary of conchubor high king of ulster realizes in a spasm of clear vision what she had never guessed beforethat love is mortal and that her lovers passion great though it be is less pure less simple and less confident than her own he can doubt and love dies she feels that the only thing left to do is to end well what began beautifully to see that nothing fair is spoilt they must go back to king conchubor in his city of emain though there is more than a suspicion of treason and a certainty of sorrow and emptiness no one who reads the play whose mind has been exalted by what has gone before doubts for a moment that deirdre is right though her reasons are not those that cold sense can approve the argument is emotional not intellectual and we feel at every turn that emotion is right it is something greater than instinct or intuition  it is the sure and perfectly lucid perception of a higher truth than can be reached by chopping logic deirdre in a very low voice with the tide in a little while we will be journeying again or it is our own blood maybe will be running away sile turns and clings to him the dawn and evening are a little while the winter and summer pass quickly and what way would you and i naisi have joy for ever   naisi protests that they will stay in safety deirdre theres noplace to stay always its a long time weve had pressing the lips together going up and down resting in our arms naisi waking with the smell of june in the tops of the grasses and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest its a long time weve had but the end has come surely he still protests deirdre shaking her head slowly there are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of samhain  but there is no way to keep life or love with it a short space only its for that theres nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleepingits for that were setting out for emain macha when the tide turns on the sand naisi giving in youre right maybe it should be a poor thing to see great lovers and they sleepy and old deirdre with a more tender intensity were seven years without roughness or growing weary seven years so sweet and shining the gods would be hard set to give us seven days the like of them its for that were going to emain where therell be a rest for ever or a place for forgetting in great crowds and they making a stir synge died before he was forty to assign a class and a division to imaginative artists to register marks and award prizes is the privilege and pleasure of examiners and literary historians it is not for the contemporary critic to order niches in the temple of fame neither should he place poets nor pronounce irrevocable dooms therefore we draw no comparisons we have avoided even the obvious pleasures of contrast only we are sure that john

  trevlyn hold or squire trtvlyrcs heir new novels bythe author of  east lynne 3 vols tinsley brotherstrevlyn hold is more interesting and less melodramatio than most of mrs woods later works there is nothing startling about it not even a ghost she has succeeded in working out a good story full of action and plot without the aid of any very gross crime there is not a single murder worthy of the name not a robbery commonly so called not a forgery not a divorce case and only a very mild commonplace trial before a few county magistrates and yet strange to say in spite of this forbearance mrs woods new novel is more exciting than any she has produced since her first success in east lynne this is partly owing to her having refrained for once from imparting to her readers any lessons in teetotalism or political economy so that the story runs its course uninterruptedly and is full of interest from beginning to end another marked improvement in trevlyn hold is that there is more delicacy of touch in the delineation of the characters more light and shade than is usual with this author there aresome good points to be found even in members of the unpopular family and we are led to suppose that some of the persecuted race are liable to occasional failings of temper which render them infinitely more lifelike and true to nature than her heroes usually are mrs wood true to herself however is far from neglecting her favourite theory of retribution villany she believes brings its own reward even in this world innocence is sure to triumph sooner or later whether this is always the case in real life we do not feel so confident but in the world of fiction where the author has an unlimited power of bestowing rewards and punishments it would be hard if the wicked were to go scatbless and if the virtuous failed to obtain their rights at the end of the third volume the story of  squire trevlyns heir is as follows the old squire dies leaving one single daughter and two married daughters to succeed to his estates of his two sons one has run away in early youth and is supposed to have died abroad the other always a delicate invalid has died of consumption also abroad leaving a wife and an infant daughter but the squire never knows for it is fraudulently kept from him that joes widow has given birth to a posthumous son who should of course be heir to trevlyn hold the squire is a passionate vindictive old gentleman and tyrannical withal he is angry with his eldest daughter for having married tom ryle the gentleman farmer and he is angry with his son joe for having married the clergymans daughter and it is not difficult to persuade him to leave his property which is not entailed to the other married daughter mrs james chattaway and her children james chattaway has for years established himself at  the hold as confidential adviser and manager of the estates and by persuading or bribing the unmarried daughter to aid him in keeping the secret mr chattaway succeeds in concealing the birth of joes son and securing the inheritance for himself after his own sons rupert and joseph the squire accordingly bequeaths the hold to his second daughter mrs chattawaythus cutting off all hope for though children of his son joe and of his eldest daughter mrs ryle at the time the story opens james chattaway has been for born years in possession of trevlyn hold and his son cris lords it over his cousins bravely as the young squire should do mrs kyle is bitterly aggrieved that her son trevlyn kyle is deprived of his lawful rights and the neighbours generally regard the chattaways as usurpers and interlopers and feel convinced that rupert trevlyn poor joes orphan boy should be if all had their rights the master of trevlyn hold mr chattaway has received into his family joes children for their widowed mother is also dead and a pleasant life rupert and maud trevlyn have of it there mrs chattaway a weakminded helpless woraau does her best for them but she is as much afraid of her husband as they are and she can do but little to help them maud is made governess to the younger chattaways and rupert is honoured with the office of clerk at some mining works on the estate cris and octave chattaway taking good care meanwhile that they shall not be spoilt by any foolish overindulgence from softhearted mrs chattaway aunt diana tbe unmarried miss trevlyn who also resides at the holl is anxious that no gross injustice or cruelty should be perpetrated and so far as she is concerned administers justice to all her nephews and nieces with an even hand the hero of the tale is george ryle mrs ryles stepson a thoroughly upright conscientious young man who with the most unselfish motives manages trevlyn farm for his stepmother and halfbrother pays off all chittaways unjust claims upon them and is ready to retire in his brothers favour the moment he is required to do so of course george ryle falls in love with maud trevlyn and though persecuted with attentions from octave chattaway never swerves from his allegiance to the oppressed governess and equally of course is handsomely rewarded at last rupert trevlyn is however the bestdeveloped character in the book and in his wrongs and sufferings the interest chiefly centres worn out by a long train of daily insults from his uncle and cousins and stung to madness by a horsewhipping unjustly administered for some trifling offence rupert seizing a burning torch plunges it into a hayrick which stands temptingly close at hand and thereby ruins all his hopes of any mercy from the avaricious chattawaywe will not here relate the end of the story for it would forestall the pleasure of reading the book itself assurance may be given that though cruel chattaways are defeated in the most surprising and unexpected manner and that  the hold  becomes the property of its rightful owner all in good time there are some very welldepicted scenes scattered about the three volumes the accident at the mine and the burning of the ricky ard the death of farmer ryle and the advent of the mysterious stranger with the red umbrella are all excellent some of the characters too are original and well contrasted one with the other gentle mrs chattaway and her strongminded bisters airs ryle and diana trevlyn are good so are nora the bustling housekeeper at the farm and ann canham the weakeyed but worthy charwoman at the lodge take it all in all  trevlyn hold is a successful novel and will be more popular than many of its predecessors though perhaps it is not up to the standard of east lynne which seems to be still the work of this prolific author,northamerica_contra

  hie wei of life by robert herrick macmillan  co there is in this story a good deal of vitality and human nature the life is the life of chicago and the writing is frequently more american than english proper but the author of 4 the web of life has observed and has something to show for it there is a good deal of realistic detail in his not very cheerful story and his people do not take very sanguine views of the world nor of their position in it the description of some waste land in the neighbourhood of chicago is given with a good deal of sombre force and there are other points of interest on the whole a lack of art and feeling for composition is visible throughout,northamerica_contra

  a hose of yesterday by f marion crawford macmillan  co is not mr crawford writing rather too fast  novels are no doubt shorter than they used to be but even so one every three months which or something like it seems to be about his present rate of output must bo a heavy strain on the most fertile imagination we seomto see some evidence that it is telling on him not that he writes less carefully than usual but the tendency to disquisition on general subjects seems to be growing on him as if the strain of thinking out his story had to be relieved by a little discursive talkof a kind that comes easily to any practised writeron topics moro or less remotely suggested by his narrative thus we have several pages upon divorce socialism and the  woman question at large one or two about the transmission of letters and the theories it i j might suggest to an inhabitant of mars if  j provided with a glass which would appaj rently enable him to see the letter and not f the vehicle which bore it and a finale upon art and truth on all these subjectsthe first and last at any ratemr crawford writos shrewdly and suggestively but most readers will we think a little resent being stopped in their progress through the story or detained when it is finished in order to hear just then what he has to say another sign of overhaste is a certain lack of organic construction the scene at the opening in which sylvia strahan over a copy of diirers famous  knight and death betrays her heart to though chivalrous elderly colonel who is the hero of the story has little or no bearing on what follows it is not referred  i to again and except as an illustration of a j col wimpoles character serves no purpose 39  in the development of the narrative sudden lj j death too is surely a cheaper mode of ie  solving a dilemma than a writer of mr t j crawfords skill is entitled to use on the je whole the book though readable like everyp thing its author writes strikes us as a trifle  fragmentary  a rose of yesterday by f marion crawford 6s mac millan there is a disappointment in store for admirers of mr crawfords work he gives them in a rose of yesterday  neither glowing italian romance nor the careful detailed study of roman or new york society evidently he has written his new book with a serious purposethat of warning us against the dangers of facilities of divorce we have no quarrel with that his reflections on the subject are not interesting mr crawford is not a thinker nor even an inspiring preacher but as a man with something earnest to say we respect him now to make his sermon effective he should either have made his middleaged heroine divorce her mad and bad husband or convinced us by glimpses at her later life that she never did so as a warning or as a fine example she would equally well serve his purpose but he has not the courage to do one or the other just when the virtuous faithful old lover is trying to persuade her that there she is under no obligation to rejoin her husband who is about to be released from the asylum and when she is resisting but not in a way convincing to the reader mr crawford kills the mad bad husband and the virtuous old lover steps respectably into his shoes  what is the use of his storywhich apart from a moral is not entertaining and which has no moral there is a halfdeveloped boy that interests us a little and an abortive romance of a young girl for an elderly man which does not interest us at all and does not interest mr crawford for he drops it limply and wanders away from it to preach his sermon with the illustration which is no illustration but a shirking of the whole position  new novels i4 rose of yesterday by f marion crawford macmillan  co mr marion crawford is one of the few novelists whom one cannot take for granted other men have their brands and are true to them before we open their books we know what to expect but mr crawford is continually producing a surprise he has now pulled out yet another new stop and in a rose ofyesterday  we are offered sheer ibsenism the rse of yesterday is mrs harmon whom we meet at lucerne travelling with her son archie a halfwitted youth of exceptional strength mrs harmon is the wife of a man who took to drink became brutalise4 illtreated his wife lost his reason and was confined in an asylum enter colonel wimpole the old lover of mrs hprmon he never told his love but she is aware of it and silently returns it they discuss harmon and his possible recovery and the colonel without success urges her to take divorce proceedings this is in the morning and in the afternoon of the same day mrs harmon hears that harmon has recovered and receives from him a letter asking her forgiveness and making plans for the restoration of their home life her struggle over the reply to this request is the kernal of the book she cables the word  forgiven and then for the first time learns from archie a true account of his relations with his father in this scene mr crawford reminds one not a little of ghosts and the total effect producedd is very similar to that left by ibsen archie who is but a child in intellect is led to tell the story of his fathers cruelty the man had continually hit him with the knob of his stick on the back of the head the narrative proceeds i once when you were off somewhere for two or three days on a visit he came at me with a poker that was the last time i suppose he had been drinking more than usual what happened   asked helen oh well id grown big then and i got sick of it all at once you know he never tried to touch me again after that 1 helen recalled distinctly that very unusual occasion when sbe had been absent for a whole week at the time of a sisters death harmon had seemed ill when she had returned and she remembered noticing a great change in his manner towards the boy only a few months before he had become insane what did you do she asked i hit him i hit him badly a good many times then i put him to bed i knew he wouldnt tell  archie smiled slowly at the recollection of beating his father and looked down at his fist helen felt as though she were going mad herself it was all horribly unnaturalthe fathers cruel brutality to his afflicted son the sons ferocious vengefance upon his father when he had got his strength i you see continued archie  i knew exactly how many times he had hit me altogether and i gave all the hits back at once that was fair anyhow heien could not remember that he had ever professed to be sure of an exact number from memory  h ow could you know just how many times  she spoke faintly and stopped half sick   blocks answered archie  i dropped a little blot of ink on one of my blocks every time he bit me i used to count the ones that had blots on them every morning when they all had one blot each i began on the other side till i got round agin some had blots on several sides at last i ont know how many there were now but it was all right for i used to count them every morning and remember all day there must have been forty or fifty i suppose but i know it was all right i didnt want to be unfair and i hit him slowly and counted oh his eyes brightened suddenly ive got the blocks here ill go and get them and we can count them together then youll know exactly  archie unpacked the toys in silence and arranged the blocks all on one side in a nest pile while on the other he laid the soldiers and the little cart with the few remaining toys helens eyes became riveted on the bits of wood there were about twenty of them and she could plainly distinguish on them the little round blots which archie had made one for each blow he had received he began to count and helen followed him mechanicall he was very methodical for he knew that he was easily confused when he had counted the blots on each block he put it behind him on the floor before he took another from the pile he finished at last sixtythreeju 1 he checked himself i forgot i wont say  jukes any more i wont there were sixtythree in all mother besides i remember now yes there were sixtythree i remember that it took a long time because i was afraid of not being fair this is gruesome enough and something new from the author of dr claudius  and  mr isaacs  a roman singer  and zoroaster mrs harmon is moved by her sons story to write her husband a long letter in which she offers again to live with him but states that love is impossible another scene with cilonel wimpole follows in which he pleads for her and her frustrated life but she refuses to be diverted from what she believes to be her duty on returning to the hotel they find a telegram announcing harmons death such is mr crawfords theme or all of it that need be told there are two other characters and a parallel story but they are of no importance the object of the book appears to be ethical a contribution to the solution of the problem of duty before desire in his concern to find an answer mr crawford has forgotten that it is the duty of the novelist to put his readers pleasure before philosophy i cannot describe  a rose of yesterday  as either a good story or a good tract it makes me long

  dr vermonts fantasy by hannah lynch dent  cothe halfdozen stories that make up this volume have each an air of something like distinction the author has since the appearance of earlier work gained a good deal of this quality to dedicate each separate story in a collection to a different person is a french fashion which in the present instance seems not inappropriate miss lynch possesses something of the method choice and treatment of subjectsnot necessarily risky onesthat we are over here only beginning to appreciate at their real worth a passing lack of firmness and want of certainty are perhaps the most obvious faults and yet they are after all hardly apparent  dr vermonts fantasy especially is as far from being commonplace as it is from being over facile the aspect of the river island in southern france where the curious drama is enacted is impressively rendered so are the actors in it perhaps it is merely idle to ask whether the situation would have gained anything had the narrator been somebody else rather than the middleaged englishwoman who tells the story somehow she seems just a tiny bit unfitted for and out of key with her part there is merit of another sort in a page of philosophy and the little marquis both are completely off the beaten track and have original observation and a rare reticence in the matter of detail except  brases which is set on irish ground all the stories are continental brases has less delicacy of touch and the imaginative envelope is thinner than in the others but it too has grace of manner and expression,northamerica_contra
  behind the beyond by stephen leacock john i lane 3s 6d net the sketches in this book of mr leacock are in the main lighter than those recorded in  sunshine sketches of a little town although they are no less enjoyable on this account and the quaint illustrations add greatly to their value a modern problem play and the retroactive existence of mr juggins are two of the best skits in the book in the former the author has managed aptly to obtain just the right amount of humorous yet satirical criticism to show the utter artificiality of so many of the socalled problems while  the retroactive existence  is a most annoying affair and carries the reader with it to such an extent that he like juggins in the story feels that he must go gradually backward until he gets further than behind the beyond the barber is again well to the front and has a chapter devoted to his little peculiarities of getting excited about various matters and illustrating his points by frantic flickings of the towel and occasional thumps on the head of his prostrate client evidently mistaking the covered face for an election table mr leacock has almost a sphere to himself in his sketches and should be assured of an appreciative public for what he writes is always worth reading,northamerica_contra
  sir brook fossbrooke sir brook fossbrooke by charles lever 3 vols 8vo pp 971 24s blackwoods the wrath of achilles compelled him to resignthat of sir william lendrick constrained him to fight to the last such is the real key to this very clever novel it is perhaps the most finished of mr levers as to plot the nominal hero is one f his stock charactersa man of the world who has been everywhere seen and done everything always losing everything and always tumbling on his feet again in some extraordinary manner we cannot take much interest in him he resembles a civilised hawkeye if hewas new he would be very good but we have seen his double too often before however he fills up space uncommonly well and his adventures give opportunity for some capital descriptions and little bits of worldiyadvicejwhich come from no one better than the author of  harry lorrequer a party intrigue to get an octogenarian judge to resign would not seem a very promising basis for a novel which was to appear by instalments in a popular magazine yet few could pass a scene with baron lendrick and not wish to know whether he was ultimately triumphant over courts cabals and an unscrupulous press true there is much to be said for his enemies his incredible vanity tempted attack but the sharpness of his tongueand we not only read about bis wit bnt can enjoy itooa pat down the assailants the reality of his danger makes the contest perilous enough to interest whilst the extreme inferiority of the dogs which would beard the sick lion enlist all sympathy on one side only his generosity prevents his eating them up and though we see their footprints as they come out it is evident they have been sorely mauled varied attainments will always excite more varied if not more powerful envy and as the chief baron is alwaysin his old age at leastacute enough to appear only on his own grounds he could only be reached through the newspapers once indeed the lordlieutenant tried to see what he could do himself he fared as agamemnon would have done in the tent of achilles the host asserted every privilege and he told the story to his son who he used to say had inherited his temper but not his abilities in these words he twice rose to go away but on each occasion i had something to say that induced him to sit down again it was the whole case of ireland we reviewedthat is did i deployed the six millions before him and he took the salute yes sir education religious animosities landtenure drainage emigration secret societies the rebel priest and the intolerant parson even nationality and mendicant insolence all marched past and he took the salute   and now my lord said i  it is the man who tells you these things who has the courage to tell and the ability to display them and it is this man for whose retirement your excellency is so eager that you have actually deigned to make him a visit that he may carry away into the next world perhaps a pleasing memory of this it is this man i say whom you propose to replaceand by what my lord and by whom  will a mere lawyer will any amount of nisi prius craft or precedent give you the qualities you need on that bench or that you need sadly need at this councilboard  go back my lord and tell your colleagues of the cabinet that providence is more merciful than a premier and that the same overruling hand that has sustained me through this trial will uphold me i trust for years to serve my country and save it for some time longer from your blundering legislation that a man of such conceit as this at last falls a prey to some one who knows how to fool him to the top of his bent is a matter of course but there are many excuses for the blindness of sir william the villain of the tale is his own stepson separated from his wife and at issue with his son the old judge must fabricate for himself some kind of domestic lares his good dinners and what all who hear them for the first time admit them to be his good stories will provide him with listeners and flatterers for his evenings but he wants a majordomoa man who will make out his dinnerlist and see that his champagne is iced who can receive sir brook fossbrookes and doctor his horses in fact a primeminister whose head nevertheless is in every sense alwajs at his disposal but dudley sewell the man of forged acceptances and questionable racingbets is not to be governed altogether by even an irish chief baron and a possible peer it is a rich treat to see how he not only carves the judicial meat but rearranges the judicial wardrobe sir william is transformed into a  dandy of fifty who bows with a grace this deception does not last long but it is necessary in an artistic point of view the old man deserves a fall and even his best friends are glad to find he is not infallible meanwhile sir brook who ought to have been his most trusted friend is far away making his fourth or fifth fortune and of course spending it in daydreams before he has got it he comes back in triumph to find sir william as great as ever still demanding his peerage as the price of resignation but sobered by the recollection that he has at last given some ground for the accusation of senility at last he extorts the offerbut from the enemy he outlives the government which denies him justice and is too magnanimous to lend himself to the intrigues of their successors perhaps the incapacity of his heir may have something to do with his refusal and affection tempers pleasantly enough the last exhibition of intellectual conceit mr lever is rather too fond of letting ns know exactly what his characters like for their meals it is not that they are gluttons but we dont go to books of this class for a dietary though we might easily compile one from them the dialogue is sparkling the perpetual flavour of irishisms is not overdone and much as mr lever has written we doubt if he has ever told a less affected or a more wellwrought tale wo dont like the book the less because it appears without any grotesque illustrations like so many of the novels which are published by messrs blackwood and sons it is got up beautifully and will take a handsome place in any library long after thc first gloss is worn off by the thorough perusal its merits will ensure  sir brook fossbrookke there was a controversy some years ago between two wellknown periodicals upon the subject of lord lyttons novels one declaring its preference for his earlier the other for his later works however this may be there can be no doubt that mr levers productions are susceptible of a similar dispute for whilst they are all more or less based upon a similar plan of fiction their diction their colouring their construction have undergone from the first a gradual but marked modification this even to a careless observer was sufficiently apparent in  tony butler and in the story now before us it will be found confirmed  sir brook fossbrooke  we conceive to be one of the best of mr levers productions we cannot characterise it better than by the word clever it is essentially a clever novel moreover it exactly conforms to the true idea of the romance it supplies us with the precise entertainment that is expected to be found in fiction it is interesting and it is amusing excitement is offered without the violation of probability and it is eloquent without labour or artifice it is wholly destitute of those narratives of practical jokes and that eagerness to excite merriment which so retard the action of his earlier novels though the scene of the story is almost wholly laid in ireland the author has ver sensibly omitted all the hackneyed expletives of the conventional hibernian interlocutor there is only one  faix  in the book and what little irish there is supposed to be is so englished as to pass almost unnoticed dr lendrick a mild and amiable but nervous man the discarded son from matrimonial reasons of chief baron sir william lendrick of the court of exchequer resides with his son and daughterlucy and tomin a pleasant little spot near the river shannon thither one day attracted by the rumour of the excellent fishing to be had in the neighbourhood come sir brook fossbrooke and young trafford a subaltern in hms th casually meeting tom lendrick they are invited to his fathers house the swans nest and there he introduces them to his sister lucy the description given of sir brook fossbroope is excellent an old man who has combatted life in a multitude of shapes whose early years have been devoted to dissipation and who in his riper age yields himself up to abstract contemplations and scientific inquiries sir brook no sooner casts his eye upon lucy than he feels himself insensibly attracted towards her a resemblance to some cherished object in the past awakens in him a paternal affection and it may be said that from that moment he becomes the firm and faithful friend of the two young people nor is the impression made by lucy upon trafford less acute though with him it assumes a nature more romantic prior to his visit dr lendrick makes a journey to dublin to see his father who has been suddenly seized with a severe indispositiona fact that leads his warmhearted medical attendant dr beattie to believe a favourable moment has arrived to reconcile the father and son we are then introduced to sir william lendrick the chief barod an octogenarnan and an insufferable egotist this portrait is elaborate and apparently laboured but it is coloured with great discrimination sir william lendrick claims a larger share

nature the most acid and intractable and domestic turmoils having at last become too frequent to be longer endured this happy couple finally agree to separate nevertheless the wife occasionally honours the husband with a call and these encounters are generally marked with the profoundest courtesy on one side and the most eccentric politeness on the other the interview between the father and son results in this the old man requests him to allow lucy to live with him at his residence  the priory and further adds that he has the gift of an inspectorship of hospitals abroad which he offers to dr lendrick and which after some hesitation is accepted lucy takes up her abode with her grandfather and tom and sir brook fossbrooke both equally poor lay their heads together to devise some method of amassing a fortune the following will afford some idea of the ingenuity of their speculations the colloquy occurs between tom and his father prior to the departure of the latter from his country dr lendrick asks tom his schemes for the futurei we have got several sir the difficulty is the choice sir brook was at one time very full of buying a great tract in donegal and stock ing it with all sorts of wild animals we began with deer antelopes and chamois and last night we got to wolves bears and tigers we were to have a most commodious shootingbox and invite parties to come and sport who instead of going to bohemia the rocky mountain and to africa would find all their savagery near home and pay us splendidly for the privilege there are some difficulties in the plan it is true our beasts might not be easy to keep within bounds the jaguar might make an excursion into the marketplace the bear might eat a butcher sir brook besides doubts if ferne could be preserved under the game laws he has sent a case to brewster for his opinion dont tell me of such absurdities said lendry trying to repress his quiet laugh  i want you to speak y and seriously i assure you sir we have the whole details of this on pap even to the cost of the beasts and the pensions to the widows of the keepers that may be devoured another plan that we had and it looked plausible enough too was to take oat a patent for a wonderful medical antidote as sir brook says there is nothing like a patent medicine to make a man rich and by good l1ck he i posd of the materialfor one he has the secret for curing the bite of the rattlesnake he got it from a tusoarora indian who i believe was a sort of fatherinlaw to him three applications of this to the wound have never been known to fail  but we are not infested with rattlesnakes tom  thats true sir we thought of that and decided that we should alter the prospectus of our company and we have called it the antidote to an evil of stupendous

book the are admirably sketched but intensely repulsive characters colonel sewenl is an accomplished swindler of the worst type he fleeces or attem to fleece everybody he meets he is shown to us as a

bound with a sort of ecstasy yet this is the woman who is maltreated by her husband in the most atrocious manner once flogging her with his horsewhip once turning her out of the house in the dead of night and for ever muttering in her ear with white lips and trembling whisper words of cruel import yet whatever sympathy for her position her sex may compel from us we cannot help the edge being blunted by the despicable character that is disguised beneath an immaculate exterior  nor can we easily deny that all that she gets she very richly deserves however much we may detest the unmanly heart that dictates the chastisement this lady comes to the priory where she strikes up an intimacy with lucy lendrick who however does not entirely reciprocate her apparently friendly attention old sir william lendrick contemplates her with much satisfactionas much for her beauty as for the ease and gaiety of her manners subsequently the colonel ingratiates himself in the household and by much show of humility and assumption of profound respect for the judges wisdom succeeds in rendering himself endurable nevertheless the old man from certain motives fully disclosed before long significantly hints the departure of the gallant colonel and on the strength of this his mother lady lendrick rents the  swans nest  for him where in company with his wife and children he proceeds to ensconce himself he collects round him here through the medium of dinnerparties and brandy and water a number of officers whom he endeavours to swindle but to one of whom he is unfortunate enough to lose a thousand pounds this occurrence is described with great power and the unexpected presence of his wife who watches the players from the back of her husbands chair renders the whole scene singularly effective it is not our intention to enter into any further analysis of the plot believing that we have already said enough to disclose to the reader the nature of the volumes that await his perusal it is of a somewhat complex nature though uniform and consistent indeed strength is the chief characteristic of the story the interest is unflagging the incidents with which the narrative is enlivened being disposed with the nicest discrimiia ion one error however though on the right side which will be sufficiently obvious to an attentive reader we cannot pass over without comment the dialogues are almost all too brilliant from the epigrammatic point and polish with which they are contrived we miss the flow and ease of spontaneous conversation in such men as sir brook fossbrooke and the chief baron this might be thought reasonable but to make girls or men of mediocre intellect converse with the precision and point of matured elocutionists is to violate nature the dialogues in fact seem too laboured the declamation of each speaker is too sententious the conversation seems dictated by the author of  rasselas and however admirable it may be as containing specimens of a just bty le or as a record of profound observation it could have been wished for the sake of accuracy that the language of the women bad something more of sprightliness and ease and of the men something less of artificial point as a fault apart from the artistic quality of the book may be mentioned a grievous solecism in taste which we regret mr lever should have fallen into baron lendrick is a portrait so thinly disguised that every irishman will recognise it at once while a doctor in the novel is positively identified by name this is not a legitimate course for a novelist anid mr lever is

  tales of a traveller a literary notices by geoffrey crayon gent on the appearance of bracebridge hall we were led intoa tome what formal expression of our sense of the merits and defects of mr irving  and we perceive nothing in the present volume to mollify the opinion we then delivered either as to the extent of hts powers arid acquirements or to that peculiar direction of them which ensures bira so large a portion of fashionable favour in conformity willi what we then observed we learn that the appearance of these tales has been anxiously looked for in the wellbrea circles to whom after all that is ever the most welcome which sails smoothly on the current of their predominant associations without startling them by any fatiguing originality of thought or offending them wit the inttusiou of a sentiment which can disturb the selfcoinplacency wbioh is their elysium in the article to which we allude we not only endeavoured to show that mr washington irving was essentially a writer of this class but that the curiosity is enhanced anti the approbation more pointed in consequence of so complete a conversion to the tone of the best company of an american republicanif in sinking the sentiment mr i has not also given up the name composition from an angloamerican exhibiting no small portion of the grace and aineuky of the addisonian school in point of expression and that without the occasional annoyance of a sentiment half so bold as even addisons whiggisrn is a curiosity in the world of fashion  not to mention thc insinuating properties of a studied attention to

machinery for such we suppose it to be the first part is entitled  tales of a nervous gentle j man a personification of him who was supposed to relate the very  pleasant story of the  stout gentleman in bracebridge hall they j are related as if told at the hunting dinner of a gentlemanly although foxhunting bachelor of a baronet by the different guests and are  rather incidents or isolated adventures than tales bearing out our general observation that the leading faculty of mr irving is a light and pleasant power of combining reminiscences for of positive inven  tion there is scarcely an iota indeed cur author exhibits a little j consciousness on this score for in his address to the reader he  calls very apprehensively for indulgence therefore although several j of these tales are pleasant in themselves there is scarcely one of them which is not traceable in its elements if not in its concoc  tion the adventure of my uncle for instance is in character and locality a loan from the introduction to quentin durward  the german student is an avowed piece of borrowing and if we recollect aright the only thing not borrowed is a sneer at german mysticism and the destructive fervour of mind and fluctuation of principle prevalent at the era of the french revolution from the tale entitled the mysterious picture in this collection we expected something forcible in the development but it exceedingly disappoints and to say the truth mr irving is not a man to deal with the whirlwind of passionthose tempests of mind which strip human nature of its surface and discover the primary anatomy of the soul to say nothing of length and importance of mrs ratcliffe who did all that a woman can do in this department mn irving must not pretend to bear up the train by far the best piece in this commencing portion of the storytelling is  the bold dragoon related in the person of an irish captain of cavalry it is airy and pleasant in the extreme although from an author not so entirely on the right sideawe might suspect the purity of its morality tm materiel of the next division which is entitled  buckthome and his wends is collected sans peur et sans reproche from the essays and citizen of the world of oliver goldsmith the  literary dinner borrowing additionally from the similar dinner described by smollett in humphry clinker as given by himself to his corps of reviewers it is pleasant in reference to a conversing and a curving partner in the persons of the bookselling firm who give this dinner but we can only say that if the lofty mr murray has told mr irving that he arranges bis guests above and below the salt in the form of a russian noblemans table at which the visitors at the lower end drink inferior wine while those at the head swallow claret he has satirised himself more than his said guests and his laureate and crispinusses more than his  poor devils the oftentold story of a vain young man of common powers coming to london with a manuscript in his pocket which is to make his fortune sinking finally into a hackney writer of all work is anything but new and possibly nothing can less resemble the origin of the existing class of inferior yet necessary retainers of the press than mr irvings tale of  the poor devil author a sketch by the way which does the heart of the author no very extraordinary honour was it even favourable to his head in point of fact the general verisimilitude of all this has gone by and for a very mercantile reasonthere is a more general demand in the market the history of buckthome a supposed mercenary of a higher class is in his character of a dependant on the press a perfect nullity and as to all the rest of him it is hammered out of the adventures of the strolling player in goldsmith there is some pleasantry and now and then a lively and ingenious turn in the narrative but in other respects it is trite shadowy and factitious from beginning to end lite third part takes us to an

that mr irving will dispatch an explanatory giltedged note to the father of the city forthwith the omission may be serious would however that the foregoing was the only defect in tiie banditti tales but without requiring political observations out of place we cannot help feeling some disgust at a writer who in describing sudh a state of society as these stories treat of is never led into a single generous remark upon the grossness of the tyranny and oppression which can reduce an energetic and capable people into a mental and social bondage so gloomily and inexorably destructive not a

  a ruthless avenger by mrs conney 3 vols hutchinson  co mrs conney has put together a capital sensational romance on somewhat oldfashioned lines  a ruthless avenger is a story of virtue and villainy of crime and the tracking of crime of jewels and elopements of a coronet usurped recovered and thrown away but the author has not been satisfied with mere sensations and improbabilities she has done her best to make things follow each other in natural sequence and on adequate motives and for the most part she has heen successful more than once or twice when the reader recognises trite incidents and wellworn machinery a fresh turn is given to the development of the story which relieves it from banality here and there no doubt mrs conney is commonplace and melodramatic and she does not make the best of all her situations still her novel is quite above the average of its kind and is thoroughly entertaining,northamerica_contra
  alcibiades a tale of the great athenian war by charles hamilton bromby clifton baker  son the great athenian war is of course the peloponnesian war in which alcibiades played an important and as most people think a disastrous part mr bromby however is by no means inclined to lay the blame on his hero and is determined to find justification or at least palliation for his conduct on all occasions apart from this personal attitude towards alcibiades he follows history closely and rarely permits himself to invent or even embroider this causes a certain lack of suppleness in his narrative which never seems to kindle into independent life we have a dialogue between socrates and alcibiades carefully modelled on plato xenophon is laid under contribution on several occasions a description of the plague at athens is taken straight from thucydides and alcibiadess two great speeches are faithfully adapted from the last author of course all this is legitimate enough but it is rather a dangerous method for a writer of romance  he is apt to become dry and a trifle dull and mr bromby has not escaped these faults still the book bears witness to a mind of much refinement and some scholarship and we regret that we shall have no more from the same source,northamerica_contra
  a lifts secret by mrs henry wood 2 vols wood whitten six years since for though pages of a serial this story of love amongst the rich and strikes amongst the poor is now for the first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living novelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a novelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no good puri posethe very thing

the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and

  the belle oj bowling oreen by a e barr john long a simple tale concerning the wealthy residents of dutch extraction in new york about the period of our war with the united states 181214 makes a welcome change from the numerous romances dealing with the war of independence and other hackneyed periods of american history the heroines father was one of those dignified and unostentatious citizens who lived in comfort and elegance round the fort and the bowling green notwithstandingperhaps because ofthe absence of mystery and crime and violent action interest is well sustained by a lively representation of the quickly shifting lights and shades of family life and courtship political antipathies the war the mischiefmaking of a vain and coquettish cousin and the perplexities attending the gradual extinction of duelling among speakers of english effectually prevent the course of the belles true love for a handsome youth of scotch extraction from running smooth several of the characters especially the belles relatives are effectively sketched and the quaint inversions of the dutchamerican english help to enliven the portraits so tactfully is the topic of the war handled that it is uncertain to which side the sympathies of the author incline,northamerica_contra
   the literary examer jj babaannanaan reuben medlieott or the coming man brm e savage esq author of  the bmmmit albany  my uncle the curate atlfi1 chapman and hall llm  reuben medlicott is defined by professor chatterton of the gentlemen with whom the readers of tinnier0118 fitable novel will become acquainted as the comis  who never comes full of promise in his youml11 the highest expectations on all sides able to do snvmi which he will only make up his mind he never does i up his mind and tails accordingly his great mturalr enable him to wander at will over the fieldsof human exertit and to erect his house wherever it may please him to select domain that he will make his own he settles down tobum therefore in many places but before he has advanced mill higher than the first story of a house his humour chant and he shifts the development of his energies to other mound a great energy of talk being among reuben s properties thii grows upon him as his energies of action become less and less effective his infirmities increase upon him the quality of his talk deteriorates and the subjects among which his shifting enthusiasm travels become more absurd finally after missing halfadozen times the tide of fortune he falls to pieces stranded on the shore of active life he has always been the comiug man and nothing more the experiences of reuben medlicott form therefore as we hare said a novel very profitable to be read many a clever young reader will be all the better for this vigorous lesson from a practised pen on the necessity under which those lie who would do good to themselves or to society of first finding their true path and of then woiking vigorously forward on it without looking to the right hand or the left the high reputation obtained by the former novels of mr savage will cause the public to sit down with much expectation of a feast before the present volumes every one will know his host and be justified in expecting choice food and good cookery that the food is of the wholesomest we have already shown and that it is well presented we are quite able to testify in the first place however it must be understood tbt reuben medlicolt does not present the usual characteristics of a novel in respect of intricacy of plot breathlessness of interest narrowingness of tyrants and devotedness of brets mr savage divides his work into nine books prefaces each with an argument after the manner of fielding and has indeed constructed his narrative very much more after the humour of fielding who raised novelwriting to the dignity of epic poetry than in accordance with the custom of these later times fielding however never directed all the forces of a work to any one didactic purpose and in that respect mr savage has followed the humour of our modern school that good for everything means good for nothing is the moral chosen by the author of this book and his great care throughout is to enforce it thoroughly by all the resources of his humour wit and knowledge while he is carrying the reader through a series of scenes and working out a group of wellcontrasted characters among the characters of the book dean wyndham is especially to be remembered the hardheaded restless overbearing and ambitious polemic with his ttrlffl7fj generosity his learning and his mixture of wo7  and simplicity of heart is a character of the kind which bespeaks the utmost skill and power in the  depicted it on paper the dean is not one of those abstract ideas of some three or four qualities with which oar storybooks are filled but he is a true man you bmjb  sides the strong side and the weak with fl00 mingled exactly as you see them in the world the wader thinks of the dean as he would of a living neighbour awetimes well and sometimes ill and

the succeeding extract which will introduce us also to the parents of reuben and his future wife  tbs dean was indeed the guest of canon old port at the time as mr broad and the vicar supposed the canon was an old bachelor abo had a tolerably good library and kept only toogood a table for between the sedentary habits of the student and the bonvicant he bad generally two fits of the gout in the year while in the intervals be waa ao afflicted with corns that in fact he might be said to pass bia whole life in his elbowchair accordingly being passionately fond of gossip and conversation he was always delighted when a neighbour or old college acquaintance dropped in to dine or spend a few dat with him his greatest friend was wyndham and yet the peso was so troublesome a guest that the canon was generally aa veil pleased when he left his house as when he came to it the dean turned every house he entered topsy turvy but he provoked oldport roost by his unceremonious way of tumbling about his books which kept the canon in a continual fret particularly as the dean never restored a volume to its place so that his friend was continually hobbling after him to keep his library in order one evening while toe dean continued oldport a guest it suddenly occurred to him to pay the medlicotts a visit and accordingly leaving the canon to drink his wine alone the thing of all others least agreeable to him dr wyndham took up his huge goldheaded cane tod strode across the fields to the vicarage he was a man of huge frame and gladiatorial muscle nature seemed to have designed him fer physical as well as polemical conflicts he valued himself indeed on his personal strength as much as upon his prowess in controversy and was particularly proud of his pedestrian powers he had each a pair of legs as hogarth would have given to an irish chairman er wilkie to one of the swarthy demonlike coalwhippers to be seen issuing frora those black arches in the strand which might well be imagined to form the regular communications between london and the aether world the vicar was watering his plants apparently screened from public coservation by a close hedge of beech nearly six feet high which separated his garden from the road when he heard a wellknown roogh stentorian voice call out  medlicott you know no more of gardening than you do of newtons principia ill show you how to

by a shovelhat with a particulady intolerant cock peering at him over the hedge which he waa veil able to do without atanding on tiptoe having hospitably welcomed his distinguished relative and visitor he ventured to observe goodhumouredly that he did presume to know something of a garden though he waa an humble vicar and had all his life been ready to receive instruction from any one who was so competent to afford it on moat subject aa the dean aa be spoke he hastened to open a small wicketdoor in the hedge to admit the dignitary who instantly thrust himself in stooping more than waa necessary and observing that it would not have coat five shillings more to have made the door a couple of inchea higher the vicar again meekly smiled and excused the door by observing that there waa not such a tall man as dr wyndham in the pariah of underwood or he believed in the diocese give me the wateringpot cried the doctor without noticing the vicars apology though ao nattering to his

quakers their habits and their doctrines belabouring pox and penn without mercy aad promising to administer a still mom elaborate castigation to the whole society of friends upon some future occasiona promise which he lived to redeem poor medlicott had generally a good word to say for the quakers but he rarely ventured to controvert any opinion of dr wyndhams and upon the present occasion he observed a most servile silence some time elapsed before mrs medlicott succeeded in drawing her fathera attention to reuben and to the interesting fact that the very next day was fixed for his departure for school  so you are taking my advice at last you ought to have taken it long ago he cried addressing both parents but looking at neither which was no deviation from his ordinary manners in society he then fell upon the eatables on the table as if hia friend the canon bal given him no dinner talking loudly and volubly on the subject of public schools in the necessary intervals of eating and sometimes during the process relating his own exploits at harrow and further to encourage reuben giving lively and forcible descriptions of the discipline which at that period was in vogue in most english seminaries of any notoriety reubens school days remind us of another point in which this novel is inadmissible mr savage has perfectly succeeded in truly representing the state of mind peculiar to boyhood and youth  at least so far as it concerns the depiction of a boy of cleverness and sensibility the sketch of reuben and of one or two of his schoolfellows up to the age of sixteen or seventeen is elaborate and masterly here are some pictures of reuben at a showy ball given by the barsacs who take care to patronise a select number of mr borough a boys the longexpected evening came at last and reuben found himself transported into the midst of a tumultuous assembly of welldressed people in the gay house of which he had so long desired to penetrate the interior except his schoolfellows he was acquainted with nobody there was nobody to tell him the name of any one which of the company were the barsacs or whether they were present or not he was in their bouse for an hour without knowing more than the man in the moon as the raying is he knew the ball had commenced by hearing the music feeling the floors vibrate and finding himself swayed to and fro occasionally by the movements of the dancers though he could scarcely see them he wondered what had become of winning and paid close attention to the ladies in white dresses among whom alone be expected to find miss blanche barsac so strongly had his grandfathers description of her affected his imagination suddenly his shoulder was tapped behind he turned about and found winning at his elbow  why are you not dancing  said his friend reuben replied with a faltering voice that he would rather not dance he knew little more thsn the stepshad scarcely a notion of a figure not dancethen why did you buy the dancingshoes  besides i have no partner i know nobodyat least no lady oh 111 soon settle thatcome will you dance with brown sherry pale sherry or dry sherry  you are joking said reuben his gravity

borough yonder is dry sherry and stay theres pale sherry actually looking at us asking us with her eyes tou shall honour her with your hand  what is her namer asked reuben in great excitement  blanche replied winning little guessing reubens interest in the answer pale sherry was pale  but at the same time very pretty she was what people commonly called an interesting girl she had soft grey eyes which had a particularly earnest and devoted expression in them when she was talking to you which was very flattering and very fascinating besides she had a nice figure and a demure and composed manner which corresponded admirably with her pale complexion and soft eyes none of the barsac girls were mere girls the eldest was probably twentyseven and there was net more than three er four years difference in standing between the eldest and the youngest jf course it was condescending ef the angelic blanche to dance with a boy of thirteen but he was tall for his age aad she acted her part with perfect goodhumour and goodnature keeping him right in the figure as far as she could and trying te put kan as much at his ease aa possible both were dificult things to do t not onlj was reubens

previous works of the same writer have already taken a most honourable place  reuben medlicott or the coming mau by  m w savage 3 vols chapman  hall we are bound to state that mr savage does not improve as a novelist  my uncle the curate as the athentpum said on the occasion of its appearance ath no 1115 was a dull bookbut this is a duller onenot solely because of its subject but in part from the manner in which that subject is wrought out a narrative of foibles bearing bitter apples for fruitof hopes disappointed and promises unfulfilledcan rarely be very inspiriting yet miss edgeworth in her stories of vivian the persuadable man and of basil lowe the procrastinator knew how to administer such relief and contrast that we could read those admirably executed tales without our hopes in humanity being chilled and without our views of life becoming pinched and dwarfed by reason of the low and waste monotony of the prospect within which they were confined it may be recollected that we object to mr thackeray as to a novelist who deals too grudgingly with all that is amiable and elevated  but even into his most discouraging scenessuch for instance as the surprise of becky over her petit soaper with lord steynehe will every now and then throw a touch of strong feeling and human interest now we have met with few writers who scatter their amenities so sparingly as mr savage without commanding de balzacs force or minuteness he has all de balzacs dreariness his story contains a character and exhibits a complete picturebut the person selected is singularly unpleasingand the fulllength gallery picture has not an inch of blue sky or an episode of flowervase in the background by way of relief failure at schoolfailure at collegefailure in parliamentfailure at the barfailure in platform oratoryfailure even in the quaker asceticism through which the coming man passes as one phase of his many changes such are the incidents of mr selvages book reuben medlicott has many showy qualities and gracious gifts but he is as unstable as water and as vain as a foolish french beauty of the ancien regime such a hero mr savage may rest assured would never have married the daughter of the quaint old dissenting dame from whom he had his schooling nor is there any one character in the book which may serve as a foil to the hero in right of extraordinary gifts or virtues his mother is foolish his father is a nonentityhis aunt is weak the idol of his schoolboy days marries his grandfatherhis favourite associates a french shoemaker and a sister are not much better than they should be the descriptions are more smart than strongmore diffuse than impressive we select one of the best and most manageable scenes a protestant meeting at chichester all tremendous demonstrations resemble one another very closely an excited knot of noblemen and gentlemen on a platform a tumultuous sea of heads on the floor an agitated bevvy of mothers aunts and sisters in a gallery a little table for reporters a peer in the chair if a peer can be found to fill it but never anything beneath the baronetage on the present occasion the platform was thronged with parsons and squires until it overflowed and every now and then a vicar or a pair of topboots came tumbling down among the smockfrocks who united their shoulders to heave him up again when this disaster befell a man of ordinary dimensions he was reinstated on the platform with no great difficulty  but when it happened to public characters of more than average weight the attempt to replace them sometimes proved as ineffectual as in the case of the celebrated humpty dumpty in the nursery rhyme it was unquestionably a  tremendous demonstration of the lungs of the men of sussex john bull bellowed like a herd of his fourfooted namesakes and the protestant lion roared his best without the slightest respect to the nerves of though ladies bottom would have been greatly scandalised awful resolutions were proposed by peers and seconded by commoners but as to the eloquence it was uniformly stifled by its own applause and perished for ever in the premature raptures of the audience it was proved however beyond a doubt that there were two curtii present ready to jump into any chasm which the british soil might please to open beneath their feet a brutus in buckskin was equally prepared to sacrifice all the private affections to the public welfare  as to sydneys hampdens and russells they appeared that day in a force that reflected undying honour upon the patriotism of englishmen how often popery was flatly negatived with the energy of cromwell himself is not to be told in figures but three orators at least pledged their lives and fortunes to defend the throne and the altar the same number of prophetic voices foretold the sunset of british liberty and thrice three times was it powerfully urged upon thc vast assembly to unite heart and hand in a  strong pull a long pull and a pull altogether in the front of the gallery assigned to the ladies who came to brave the roaring of the lion aforesaid sat mrs medlicott and hannah and mary hopkins their eyes were riveted on the platform but it was not on the chairman they gazed although he was the earl of stromness nor on the vicar for he was lost in the crowd nor on mr pigwidgeon ludicrous figure as he cut for there was no novelty in that you had only to watch the point where the three lines of female vision united to convince yourself that they sought nothing saw nothing thought of nothing during that great day and demonstration but the youngest of thc patriot band he who came to dedicate the firstfruits of his talents and his fame to the service of his creed and his country probably few of the ladies present had been unobservant of reuben from un early

  barren honour a tale by the author of guy livingstone 2 vols parker son  bourn the title of this novel is the clue to the lesson which it is intended to inculcate it is generally considered a high crime and misdemeanour against the laws of novel reading to glance at the end of a book till we have fairly and honestly worked our way through the preceding volumes up to the last page without having a notion wnat we shall find there but nevertheless we believe that by bearing in mind the catastrophe upon which the plot is hinged we are not only able to take a more lively and absorbing interest in the story itself but we are also better qualified to appreciate justly and without bias the powers and abilities of the writer in carrying out the design he has in view we do not therefore apologise for quoting here the last words of the author of barren honour  i have attempted he says to sketch roughly what befell a man very weak and erringwho was often sorely triedwho acted ever up to the light that was given him at the cost of bitter selfdenial and selfsacrificewho nevertheless in this life failed to reap the tithe of his reward alan wy verne was strong up to a certain point but he had not faith enough to make him feel always sure that he had done right in defiance of appearances nor principle enough to keep him from repining at results he could neither comfort himself nor others thoroughly he was a chival rous truehearted man but a very imperfect christian he dared not openly rebel against the laws of god but he was too human to accept unhesitatingly the fulfilment of his decrees throughout alans life honour usurped the place where religion ought to have reigned paramount he shrunk from shame when he would perhaps have encountered sin to that one principlesound enough if it had not been the ruling onehe sacrificed love and friendship and revenge and life thus it will appear that the author proposed to himself no very light or pleasant task when he undertook to prove by relating this story what a barren fruitless dreary comfortless and unsatisfactory thing honour becomes when a man has no higher principle of action no more solid basis on which to rest his future hopes sir alan wyverne had but one great object in life the desire to do his duty thoroughly as a gentleman and a man of honourand he did it but his life was a failure the story is an old one but not the less interesting for that sir hubert vavasour is an honest goodnatured reckless country squire with a mortgaged estate an idle son a lovely daughter and last but not least a clever and intriguing wife alan wyverne the squires nephew is not unlike him in character and the two are sincerely attached still more attached however is sir alan to his beautiful cousin helen and though he knows he has already wasted the chief of his substance in riotous living and that lady mildred will certainly  forbid the banns he nevertheless has the temerity to avow his affection to his cousin as well as to her father and ventures to indulge in some hope that it may be possible to arrange satisfactory settlements enabling him eventually to carry off the fair helen as his lawful prize sir hubert is quite aware of all the difficulties in the path but he cannot resist the temptation to make his daughter and his nephew happy so he shakes his bead and consents but owns he has not the moral courage necessary to announce the awful fact to my lady my lady however baffles them all she caresses her daughter playfully reproaches the culprits plan and fairly puzzles her husband by her tacit acquiescence but in her heart she makes a vow that  it shall never be  she thought that such a weddingdress would become her daughter worse than a windingsheet and she will leave no stone unturned to break off the engagement she goes to work warily and with caution and makes alan feel properly grateful to her for her great kindness and consideration she however contrives to persuade him to wait a twelvemonth before fixing the weddingday and she insinuates that her daughter is exacting and absurdlyjealous for the rest she trusts to her usual good fortune and lies in wait for an opportunity to make the most of the little advantages she has already gained on her sons max vavasour return home the tug of war begins in earnest max openly avows his regret at the marriage having been even so far settled he owns he  has no prejudice against wyverne personally for nobody has such weaknesses nowadays but it is a simple question of political expediency max brings his friend lord clydesdale to the dene it is too late now of course to hope any good can come of that but max and his mother understand each other and they have a year before them yet raoul tenth earl of clydesdale was the premier parti of england and a coarse selfish overbearing illlooking young man but it would have been a very proper match for helen and so lady mildred feels naturally aggrieved at the thought of how much had been lost by alans rash and precipitate conduct lord clydesdale moreover no sooner set eyes on helen than he began to think himself an illused man he could have made up his mind to confer on her the title of countess of clydesdale and he did not see what right wyverne had to secure the young lady without even giving him a choice in the matter it was not to be born with patience his friend and toady harding knowles suggests that many things might happen before the fatal twelvemonth is over  sir alan might die you know or miss vavasour come to her senses harding does not object to laying very long odds say 6000 to 50000 that the marriage will never take place the bet ls accepted and booked with looks of wicked crafty significance by knowles who for some trifling reason hates alan and is sadly in want of money from this moment the plot thickens alan is persecuted by letters with a curious cypher engraved on the envelope lady mildred and her daughter receive anonymous letters warning them to inquire into his conduct during his absences from the dene explanations are given and received but somehow they are not quite satisfactory lady mildred pretends to make excuses for him thereby doing his cause a great deal more harm than good helen has seen mrs lenox once and has heard of her often she is hurt and grieved at what she believes to be alans conduct with regard to that dangerous lady but she trusts him still and would conting to trust him till death only lady mildred takes care to prevent that and alan gives up his case as hopeless and retires from the field this is the weak point of the story it is extremely improbable that a man conscious of his own innocence and aware that a trap is likely to be laid for his ruin would voluntarily sacrifice the woman he loves for the sake of the woman who loves him nina lenox is a careless imprudent creature always in trouble either about love or money wyverne does not pretend to care the least about her but he was goodnatured and helped her out of her scrapes and thought her rather a bore than otherwiseyet sooner than betray her confidence to his future wife even in his own justification he quietly breaks off his marriage with helen and makes both her and himself miserable for the rest of their lives this is the great instance of alans preferring honour to every other virtue or even duty helen not caring much what becomes of her after this marries lord clydesdale and hates him though he frees her father from his heavy embarrassments and saves the dene from passing into the hands of the jew who had intended to secure the property for his own thereby earning for himself the eternal gratitude of lady mildred and her son max we will leave the dinodment of the story to unfold itself to its readers at their leisure feeling convinced that with a little judicious skipping of lengthy digressions and superfluous descriptions of character in the first volume they will never rest till they reach the end of the book there is a most exciting description of a fight with some poachers and another of a hunting feat of sir alans which will delight the male readers of barren honour and there can be still less doubt that every lady will sympathise deeply with the sorrows of the countess of clydesdale and be ready to lament the mistaken views of the too scrupulous sir alan who in everything but this overstrained sense of honour is about as perfect and loveable a character as can be met with in any novel of the present day,northamerica_contra
  broken to harness a story of english domestic 81 life new novels by edmund yates 3 vols maxwell co to the readers of the magazine edited by mr edmund yates and to his fellowworkers in literature there is no need to say that  broken to harness resembles its author in being strong manly and good at heart it ia a first novel and a better work of fiction has not for many a week come under om notice from beginning to end we have read it with lively interest and we lay it aside with an agreeable sense of refreshment and increased strength readers of every class will find in the story a liberal fund of amusement and there are those who on closing the third volume will thank the author for certain wise lessons and many tine pictures taken as a whole it is a mons novel dealing far more with bohemia clubrooms and masculine absurdities than with though refinements and graces of womans life but though it ia a  mans novel women will relish it  for throughout its diverse scenes there is a chivalric and unobtrusive recognition of feminine goodness moreover there is not even in its revelations of bohemia a single line that will raise a blush or jar upon the sensitive ear  broken to harness to what object does the title apply 1 a colt long in leg and big in bone ignorant of the collar and fresh from the marsh now for the first time put in training for roadwork  a luckless hunter that having come to grief in a steeplechase has fallen in mans esteem and is condemned henceforth to draw the van instead of following the hounds  a steed of purest pedigree but by reason of some defect from which stainless descent cannot insure immunity deemed unfit to contend for though honours of the turf a highbred dainty filly sentenced after a brief day of triumph in  the row to run between the shafts of a butchers cart or drag the phaeton of a country parson literally to none of these but figuratively to the last young ladies who dance through the season in the best  sets of may fair may shudder at the bare thought of being broken to harness and may scout the possibility that fortune will require them to put their shoulders to domestic wheels and tug away at cumbrous family coaches that stern lot however awaits the greater number of them  and in mr yatess novel they may read how one of their gentle kind and high degree was after much trouble on the part of her trainer and in spite of her skittish ways and high temper put through the manege and broken to harness the poor girl who is subjected to this indignity is barbara lexden penniless niece of a wicked old aunt whose income and place in the world of fashion make up the list of her virtues barbara has been well introduced and ably chaperoned she has made a hit and achieved rank as a reigning helle  and her aunt expects great things of her barbara herself is not disinclined to play the high game indeed she has set her heart on making a grand matchan ambition by no means rare amongst really beautiful young women who stand at one of lifes gamblingtables staking their wit and beauty against the wealth and rank of richer competitors  offers she had had in plentyyouthful peers with slender incomes middleaged commoners solemn wealthy dull    but barbara refused them all she told her aunt that she was playing for a high stake but instead of playing the game out barbara like many girls who would be selfish and worldly if their better natures would permit them ceases to care about the high stake and turns away from the green cloth with a modest prize instead of marrying a rich peer she becomes the wife of frank churchill a journalist on the staff of a daily newspaper who has no connexion whatever with the world in which barbara is accustomed to move franks father was an unsuccessful artist in poverty frank picked up his education at a country school and a german university  and when he falls in love with barbara he is living with his old mother in great adullam street which as scarcely anybody knows is a street lying between grays inn gardeas and mecklenburg square indeed barbara and frank churchill are separated by so wide a bar of social circumstances that mr yates feels it necessary to explain with much care how it was that they were guests in the same country house such a coincidence of highborn beauty and obscure toil is by no means usual but the author accounts for it satisfactorily and manages his story so well that when barbara throws her grand wicked old aunt over and in spite of protests and expostulations becomes the wife of a poor journalist readers do not feel that she is acting otherwise than naturally and in accordance with everyday experience after the wedding comes the honeymoon after that the flood of tears and regrets it is a gloomy hour for barbara when she makes her first entrance into frank churchills house in great adullam street from which humble unattractive dingy dwelling franks mother has retreated in order that the bride may feel herself mistress of her own house she is in harness  but though she begins to work with a good will her pride rebels and the weariness of her days whilst her husband is working away from home is too much for her powers of endurance of course the distance between grays inn road and park lane cuts her off from her old friends  and she is offended by such society as frank can procure for her the pipesmoking artists jealous authors and noisy bohemians who spend their evenings in his study are not persons to her taste  and she is even less pleased by their illdressed wives and chattering daughters other sources of trouble arise barbara and franks mother pull against each other  and through the malice and idleness of lookerson mutual jealousy springs up between husband and wife at last after many outbreaks of temper on the part of barbara and after a trifling display of injustice and violence on franks part the younga wife flies from great adullam street and seeks shelter in the house of a married lady how she is brought to repent this hasty step  how frank learns to judge her more leniently  how grief and the prickings of conscience bring her humbly to his side  how he acknowledging his own misconduct whilst he pardons hers takes her again to his arms  and how she is at last  broken to harness and runs merrily on thinking herself lucky in having fallen into the hands of a skilful and merciful trainerare matters about which the reader must learn from mr yates himself the ending of the tale does not quite please us frank churchill ought not to have obtained that legacy and commissionership in the tintax office  the fitness of things requires that he should by hard work in his own profession have raised himself to prosperity and power and barbara as mistress of a house in russell square ought to have made the discovery that life in mesopotamia may be and in many cases is quite as happy and gracious and refined as lifo in belgravia but our disappointment in this respect does not make us unjust to mr yates an historian must be truthful and as barbaras husband became a great man and a rich one in official circles and as she saw fit to live in a pretty villa on the banks of the thames what can mr yates do but state that such was the case apart from barbaras troubles the story contains much good matter the sketches of the clublife of authors and artists are capital enough has been said of mr yatess cleverness and power  but we have scarcely done justice to the unaffected amiability and manliness  that are amongst his most

in depreciation of the first important wvork which he has ever brought 1efore the public hitherto he has been inainly known as far as literature was concerned as a facile essayist and smnart writer like mnany other authors of his generation he suffered for a time from the supposed necessity of imitating mr dickens nobody call have a hiher appreciation than we have ourselves of the wonderful

the  authors oown knowvlodge aid vxperience amiorist novels of thll ploatographic order we should assign a ver higih llace to broken to ilariiiss it is called a story of jnglish doiiestic life  and of a certail section of that life it gives a singularly 1fiithfill a111ld powerful description the person who is broken to run in traces is a young wifea certain barbara lexdenwho having beezi brought up as the spoilt companion of a wealthy aunt marries a literary mani of siiiall mimeans revolts aainst the necessary conlitiolls of her married life is fillyll brougiht to a sense of her folly and lbecomes a devoteld and obedient wife possibly if a lady had lescrilel the samne stor sle would not have been so positive as mr yates that so much of the fault in the quarrel was onl the side of the wife and so little on that of the husband however it is a comfort nowadays to meet with a novel in which all the wome n tare not described as injured innocentstoo good for the men whom they reform by their cxample the interest of the story can scarcely be said to centre in loveaffairs at all three ladies may be called the heroines of the novel but the passages from their lives to which mr yates introduces us have very little to do with courtship frank churchill wins the proud beauty to whom he has lost his heart very early in the tale and without any of those traditional obstacles which are supposed to beset the path of true love miss townsends marriage is of the most prosaic character and poor kate mellon never gets married at all still in this as in most other respects mr yates represents life as it really is at the present day if anybody tries to recall the courtships he can recollect within his own circle he will find that ninetenths of them were eminently straightforward and businesslike arrangements and that the course of love ran as smooth as settlements and housefurnishing would allow in most cases if there is anything of romance at all in peoples lives it comes after and not before marriage nor is there any very direct moral to be drawn from  broken to harness except perhaps that literary men had better not marry fashionable ladies and that when ladies are married they had better make the best of a bad bargain life however very seldom conveys any very direct moral the plot of mr yatess novel is simple enough almost from the beginning the reader can guess what is going to happen at the end and the mere desire of finding out the clue to the mystery on which the story is professedly based will not suffice to induce any but the most inexperienced of novelreaders to go on to the last chapters the real merit of  broken to harness consists in the graphic talent of its sketches rather than in any dramatic power to any one acquainted with london life  broken to harness is a photographic gallery you turn over the pages as you might do those of an album and are surprised to see face after face with which you are acquainted the horsebreakerwho is pure as well as pretty simnel and his brother officials at the tin tax office schrdder the german banker of hebrew extraction scadgers the moneylender harding of the statesman charley beresford dr prater mr slade and many others are all persons more or less known to the public under other lames slow far this system of photographing p people you have met in the pages of a novel is altogether a desirable one me 1o ot pretend to sa y if it is to bo dtone at all it could scarcely be lone with less impleisantness than mr yates has done it snpo in always that truth in dlelineatioll is not to 10 sacrficl to consideration for the ob ject of the portirait we have very little doubt that the author had no idea his own descriptions would be easily recognised  and probably to ninetyninlo readers out of a hundred they will seem nothing more than vivid sketches unfortunately the hundredth reader will say at once  oh this is so and so  and the person or persons described are quite certain to be among this small minority and not to like the description the whole question is ono of taste many of the persons whom mr yates depicts may be regarded as public property and types of a class rather than individualities there are one or two however of the characters in broken to harness to whom the world will certainly assign other names than those given in the novel and whose introduction is we think to be deplored having made this criticism we have very little else to do except to praise mr yatess novel it has for us the wonderful chalm that the men and women talk like living beings and do not indulge in soliloquies on every possible or impossible occasion moreover the author is perfectly free from the affectation so common of late amongst minor writers of representing literary men as a sort of caste apart associating on equal terms with every class of society andoccupying aproudposition notconceded toordinaryprofessional men on the contrary mr  yates appears to us to err if anything in taking too low an estimate of the class to which bo belongs the statesman must have been singularly illiberal in its payments to contributors or else frank churchill must have had an unfortunate talent for choosing his friends amongst the lower class of newspaperwriters if he was obliged to introduce his wife to such a circle as that which is described as having frequented the house in great adullam street meopotamnia the feature which chiefly dietinguishes literature as a profession is that the personal character status habits or mode of life of its members have less direct bearing on success than in any other branch of life nobody cares whether a leader is composed in a palace or an attic written by a sot or by the most respectable of mankind the motives therefore which induce men with a view to success in their pursuits to conform carefully to the ordinary standards of society have less influence with professional newspaperwriters than with others and in consequence if a man is illbred and coarse by nature he perhaps exhibits his defects more offensively if his trade is journalism than if he were a clergyman or a lawyer on the other hand it must fairly be admitted that success in journalism presupposes a good deal of information and a more or less intimate acquaintance with a very great variety of subjects there is no class of men therefore who in virtue of their profession are more likely to take an interest in promiscuous topics of conversation than newspaperwriters and we repeat that frank churchill must have been unlucky in his circle of friends if a clever pretty woman like his wife could find no common ground of interest in their talk and society they were men so we are told who outraged none of the social convenances of life about whose manner or behaviour no direct complaint could be made and often she thought herself somewhat exacting when she would repeat to herself as she wouldoh how often that they were not gentlemen not her style of gentlementhat is to say not the style of inen to whom she had been accustomed whein for instance would a man have dared to address his conversation to any other man in preference to her she being present  when could a man have permitted her to opeti a door or place a chair for herself in that set amongst which she had previously nmoved respect her her lhuslbands friends wouild inolre her

acquaintances amonist his fellowcraftsmen as illbrud and stupid as m1r yates describes but it must have been his own fault if he could find no fitter associates for his wife amongst the men with whom he was thrown into daily contact in truth as is the case in most photographic pictures the passing sketches of mr yatess book are better than the elaborate portraits it is difficult by any single extract to givo an idea of the authors power of throwing off a sketch as a specimen let us take the account of mrs harding the wife of the editor of the statesman mnrs 1harding was a tery fair average kind of woman a dowdy little person mrs harding the daughter of a snufly welsh rector who had written a treatise on  aorists and with whom h1arding had read one long vacationa roundfaced oldmaidish little woman classically ibrought up who could construe cicero fluently i and looked upon horace q flaccus i mean as rather as loos personage in the solitude of plasydwdllem george harding was twrown into the society of this young female he did inot fall in love with herthey were neither of them capable of anything violent of that nature buti am reduced to the phraseology of the servants hall to express my meaningthey  kept company together and when george took his degree and started in life as leaderwriter for the morning cracker long since lctiilct lhe thouight the best thing he could do for his comfort was to gto for a run to wales and bring back sophia evans as his wife this lhe did  andl they had lived thoroughly happily ever since mirs iarding believed intensely in the statesmnan read it every day from the title to the printers name knew the name of every contributor and could tell who had done what at a glance lier great pride in going out was to take one of the cards sent to the office and observe the effect it made upon the receiving attendant at operas flowershows or conversazioni she always took care that the tickets for these last were sent to her and her headdress of blackvelvet bows with pearl beads hanging down behind was well to the fore whenever a mummy was unrolled the fossi jawbone of an antediluvian animal was del scanted on or some sallow missionary presented himself at burlington house to be congratu lated by hundreds of dreary people on having escaped uneaten from some place to which he never ought to have gone she herself was fond of having occasionally what she called a social evening this recreation was held on a saturday when there was no work at the statesman office when the principal members of the staff would be bidden and when the condi ments provided would be brownbread and butter rolled into cornets tea and coffee and lemonade while the recreation consisted in contersation amongst men who had met for every night during the past twelve months and in examining photographs of the city of prague the ribald young men at the office spoke of mrs harding as plutarch al name given to her one night when mr slater the dramatic critic asked her what novel she was then reading and she replied  novel sir plutarchs lives  but they all liked her notwithstanding and for her sake and their dear old chiefs did penitential duty at the occasional social evenings in decorum street probably critics may complain that  i broken to harness  gives a cynical view of life it is a book written by a man about town of men anl women in town alnd is not therefore likely to be of the gushing order blut in stray touches which occur every now alnd then arlyates shows a pathos andtendlernes3 of feelinig for which a perusal of his earlier writings would harlyv lead the reader to give him credit the narrator of the account of kate mellons death has the power if he chooses of describing something higher than mere london life eil a  broken to harness mp yates has written a story which is romantic enough to fascinate the ordinary devourer of novels sufficiently sarcastic to please the cynics who generally despise them and fraught with a lesson which may render it acceptable to those who usually object as well to the morality as to the immorality of fiction no one can complain that broken to harness is not interesting and amusing while the scenes in which the breaking process are described are true to nature and bear the impress of earnestness and care the author describes his present story as being virtually his first attempt at characterpainting if his future works fultil the promise of this he will secure for himself a respectable position among the literary artists of the day frank churchill a juan of letters falls desperately in love with and marries barbara lexden a fashionable beauty and  a thorough coquette at heart full of anticipations of happiness he carries her off to his dreary house in  great adullamstreet and expects her to revel there in coinjugal bliss but she utterly fails to realise his daydreams cut off from her early friends destitute of the luxuries to which she had been accustomed obliged to exchange the animation and colour of her old surroundings for the dullness and the prevalent leaden hue of her new home in  mesopotamia she loses her spirits and manifests a tendency to be peevish and disagreeable she is worried by a commonplace motherinlaw plagued by wellmeansing neighbours and thrown into the society of men who talk a jargon she does not understand and who treat her as an inferior being instead of showing her the deference with which she used to be addressed until she begins to wonder how she could have been so mad as to sacrifice her brilliant prospects for the sake of a perpetual view of frank churchill he on the other hand discovering too late that the maiden who fascinated him in the paradise of a perfect country house is little qualified to lead the life of a middleclass matron in a dull london residence gives himself up to a gloomy despondency and looks back with astonishment on the foolish fancies which he entertained before his inarriae at length from trivial causes there springs up so serious a misunderstanding between the husband and the wife that they separate pride and jealousy prompt her to leave him and the same feelings prevent him from seeking her out and bringing her back again to his home their sufferings while they are kept apart are admirably described and the scene in which they at last meet and are reconciled by a common sorrow is the best in the book it is one of the merits of the story that its chief interest is reserved for the end instead of reaching its climax at an earlier period and flagging afterwards there is more strength and more feeling displayed in what is almost the last chapter than anywhere else the two threads of the story intermingle at its close and the various persons who have played their parts in its representation are artistically grouped together before the curttin drops the most original character in the book is certainly kate mellon the  pretty horsebreaker the beautiful young amazon who sets conentionalities at defiance who makes her living by breaking  broken to harness  story of english domestic life by edmund yates lowx  maxwell a co and riding horses who gives little dinners

familiarly salute as kitty but whose character is above reproach whose minld i as pure and whose heart is as true as if shie were the shyest and timidest of airls is a personage somewhat out of the common way she is very pleasantly sketched and herpresene gives life and brightness to the story the oily objection to be made to her is that she is not as probable being such women mnay possibly exist but we are never likely to meet theni it seenins as if mr yates had taken the character of an ideal specimen of the anonyina  tribe had subtracted the guilty element from it and bado filled up

misconstrued while ill reality she deserves the highest esteem she is charmiingc she is fascinatingbut we find it difficult to believe in her possibility  and with ai recollection of thle famous

faiir horsebreaker are very cleverly depicted mr lberesford one of thle commissioners of the tintax office and m1r siinnel its secretary are suspiciouslv lifelike amost of the persons indeed whom mr yates brings on the stage have a singular appearance of reality and especially those who are in any way connected with the civil service or the fourth estate the conversations ill the office of the tahtctaniu newspaper and in room no 120 of the  tintax office carry with them a conviction of their truth  and the characteristics of the officials and the celebrities who are introduced at various

but ani artist who indulges in such pencillings is apt to contract a merciless habit of caricaturing flinging stones into a pond inay be very goold fun for the boys but it is a terrible bore for the

  peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and

leaving his children to face the world alone after a desperate struggle they pull through thanks mainly to nora a masterful but fascinating girl at last medlett fails as crofts had failed and is reduced to begging from the children of the man he had ruined it was the moment for which nora with her fierce yearning for vengeance had longed and prayed now at lastbut we had better leave the reader to discover what vengeance nora took such is the story improbable as it seems told in rough outline which mr neumann handles in masterly fashion we wish he could have spared us noras middleaged admirer the episode makes the book a little disjointed and it would have been easy to give her money in some simpler way as a whole the book is excellent nothing could be more convincing than the

given the fourth edition and the first with a list of variations between the second third and fourth versions the form is pretty and convenient but in a popular edition we should like something more we are not al members of the omar club we cannot read all the books that have dealt with the persian original nor follow through many volumes the lore that would tell us how far fitzgerald tampered with his model a short summary of the results of recent research should have been prefixed and save in the editors note there is no mention of fitzgerald at all i yet the book in its cheap form will

pictures illustrative of the campaign the  basis of observation  is in the main quite sound and to all admirers of the russian painter his notes must be deeply interesting even nonadmirers will find them graphic and terse verestchagin has made a great impression on the english mind because he is a painter with a declared obvious consistent purpose that it is not directly an artistic purpose is all the better for his repute among us he is a vigorous moralist a striking personality mr whiteing would have been better employed in emphasising that than in making claims for him as an artist that cannot for a moment be upheld on the artistic side he is far from despicable but for all his distinction as a man he is not one of the eminent painters of europe and to treat him as a pioneer in

haskell dole 2 vols boston us page london macmillan  co the stanzas of omar khayyam translated from the persiau by john leslie garner second edition bell  sons it is as difficult to retrace in native biography the true personality of the arab persian or central asiatic writer who has earned high distinction among eastern poets as it is to certify which of the detached pieces attributed to him are really his own and the case of omar khayyam of nishapur supplies no exception to the rule fortunately for the reputation of this particular bard there has risen at the present day a new generation of english orientalists distinguished by thoroughness of performance as well as fullness of promise who seem bent on giving us on his behalf something more than a patchwork portrait or such frontispiece to his writings as would satisfy the ordinary and unexacting western critic enlightened and encouraged on one side by the research of russian savants and on the other by though enterprise of american publishers they carry on their labours with a sober enthusiasm and quiet tenacity of purpose which cannot fail to bear good fruit so that almost before the close of the passing century we may reasonably expect to know as much of the old tentmaker as we do of his contemporaries under the angevin rulers in england readers of the royal asiatic societys journal will be at no loss to recognise the more notable workers in a scantily peopled field in mr nathan haskell doles fairly exhaustive compilation the reader must not expect to find necessarily much new light or new matter it is practically a summary of translations and paraphrases with variations of the rhymed reflections of that now famous persian thinker of the twelfth century the success of whose remarkable quatrains both in england and the united states may yet in the opinion of a fewsages or dullards according to the verdict of partisans on either sideneed justification by a profounder criticism than has hitherto been applied to them there is much of interest in the notes essays and reviews by which the anglicised or europeanized verse is accompanied but any analysis of papers mostly printed years ago would be manifestly out of place at the present time and we may content ourselves with congratulating the able compiler on the value of his reproductions and the uses he has made of them if we venture to take exception to the assertion that thanks to the attention bestowed upon his writings by modern european critics  old omar stands clearly outlined before our vision and that  if he should teappear in our day it would be as a leader of modern thought we do so under the impression that notwithstanding all that has been said and conjectured about him we have not yet attained to a full appreciation of his already published writings moreover the notion of his reappearance amongst us as a successful uptodate teacher implies a certain experience of the later world which could hardly be acquired by intuition and which even an omar khayyam could not afford to ignore the section described as  comparative versions of the rubaiyat constitutes fitzgerald a kind of fugleman to the corps of translatorsthat is to say his rendering of the supposed original leads the way and gives as it were the cue to others but as might have been anticipated the position is not maintained fitzgeralds genius was never trammelled by adherence to a rigid text and it soon becomes apparent that each expositor abandoning his imaginative and erratic leader follows out his own method of interpreting the persian manuscript in the order prescribed for this particular set of quatrains come nicolas mccarthy korney whinfield garner bodenstedt and graf von schnell elsewhere we search for and discover with specimen extracts keene pickering whitley stokes prof cowell and a host of others more or less qualified as exponents of though chosen theme the editor deserves our warmest thanks for the prominence given to the retrospect of prof cowells labours more especially for republishing that eminent scholars contribution to vol xxx of the calcutta review it is pleasant to recall how favourable and yet well poised is the professors estimate of the author of the rubaiyat as shown in the following extract  we find some excuse for his errors if we remember though state of the world at that time his clear strong sense revolted from the prevailing mysticism where all the earnest spirits of the age found their refuge and his honest independence was equally shocked by the hypocrites who aped their fervour and enthusiasm and at that dark hour of mans history whither out of islam was the thoughtful mohammedan to repair  no missionarys step bringing good tidings had appeared on the mountains of persia  the few christians who might cross his path in his native land would only seem to him idolaterschristianity came before omar only in the form of the first crusade unless oriental chronology is hopelessly misleading in regard to local history this must indeed have been about the period in which omar khayyam flourished and it is probable that the crusaders made their victorious entry into jerusalem under godfrey de bouillon shortly before his death though we have no evidence to affirm that he took the same exalted view of christianity as his religious brother and predecessor albiruni who spoke of its tenets with an admiration quite exceptional in the case of a votary of islam he could for the occasion pray with his fellowmen not only outside the precincts of the mosque but without the aid of a mohammedan spiritual guide his pen thus bears testimony on the subject wanting the rose the thorn well might avail wanting the day i make dark night avail wanting praise prayer and sheikh prescribd by rule i make church bells and christian rite avail and now before closing our brief notice of mr doles compilation we may appropriately take note of some three or four rubaiyat significant of a higherclass omar much has been said of our astronomerpoets freethinking his cynicism his restless allusions to an unalterable destiny but in how few of his stanzas have his warmest admirers or most sympathetic interpreters attempted to bring out an underlying christian spirit which is by no means quite occult or to be sought for only between the lines of his verse surely the two following quatrains taken from whinfields translation possess a sufficient flavour of christianity to acquit their author of any wholesale charge of irreligion or infidelity  whateer thou doest never grieve thy brother nor kindle fumes of wrath his peace to smother dost thou desire to taste eternal bliss vex thine own heart but never vex another  today is thine to spend but not tomorrow  counting on morrows

original and which are excellent enough to go beyond the second edition now published retain fairly the metre and meaning of the persian but translators like doctors disagree and this disagreement is

prayer fis prayer that church bells chime into the air  yes church and kaba rosary and cross are all but diverse tongues of worldwide prater the word bandagi used three times in though original and anglicised the same number of times by prayer is here a service of worship without relation to imprisonment chains or any outward sign of slavery mr whinfields footnote affirming that the meaning

her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact and has detected no error in accepted dates she has sought to paint the portrait of catherine de medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny she says  here in paris near the louvre beneath the window whence catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of st bartholomew     or near that other window which looked out upon the fastcrimsoning seine  it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past in fact miss sichels book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts but surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities that the window of the louvre overlooking the seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the st bartholomew massacre considerably postdates that tragic event for the sake of a picture however the most vivid details are sure to be selected and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt and this makes the kind of portraiture which miss sichel practises of small worth to the student and even misleading in certain cases but the method has a value of its own it supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history it gives him more than does the historical novel and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do to the appreciation of which qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable there is a danger however that the colouring of the picture may be overdone that the perspective may be false it is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice men historians often enough fall into the same fault under the influence of political and religious bias but with women it seems impossible to avoid it women are born into the world to love and love always entails hate miss sichel is not far from hating catherine de medici and the age of the renaissance in which she lived she writes  the ligue was the counterpart of catherine we have compared it to the great french revolution but there is this vital difference between the two the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea it was the beginning of an erathe death of catherine closed an epoch with her died the age of the renaissance and with the reign of henry iv there came the dawn of modern timesit was the destiny of catherine de medici to imbibe the poison of either influence that of the reformation and that of the renaissance from the reformation she derived its abusesits degradation of religion into politics its gross polemic materialism the more pernicious for priestly vestments from the renaissance she inhaled its stagnant paganism its cold curiosity its stupid blindness to aught but the senses its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in there are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men it is the death of the ideal of faith in man of faith in anything outside him these were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others history provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but sometimes unconsciously it reveals to us certain moral laws it is a medium for them not a pulpit if any person any age is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality that age is the reign of the last valoisthat person is catherine de medici most if not all of this is fustianlittle better indeed than sheer nonsense in the first place it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras epochs ages and modern times strictly speaking there is no such thing as an era an epoch an age or modern times with every minute that goes by the middle ages for instance are getting further and further away from the middle assumingwhich is of course not the case that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end to tell us that the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning and if miss sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the french revolution she is assuredly mistaken if anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudoclassical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movementa pseudoclassicism which by the way achieved among other things the complete destruction of the art of painting in franceat any rate for the presenta curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received especially as it is highly typical the gross polemic materialism of the reformation the more pernicious for priestly vestments is unfair to a highly complex movement one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison detre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism to accuse the renaissance of stupid blindness to aught but the senses is far too sweeping a charge and indeed a stupid one whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been the christian world owes to the renaissance an immense debt to say that catherine de medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man which he has never been without as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge is to give that good lady who had her commendable points an importance which she never possessed and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft  of the meed of immortality with miss edith sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency history she says provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page which is her last yet although for long men did not know it they were aremaking towards a common goal and using a common watchword that watchword that goal is freedom making f or  moving  is a slang expression but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist  of what use is the historian any way if he is not to be a conscious moralist with history or as much as he can find out about it as his text which is a theological text into the bargain  for the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of good over evil and in that conclusion we are entirely we think in accord with miss edith sichel,northamerica_contra
  dreamers of the ghetto by i zangwill heinemann mk zangwill is always at his best when he reveals the jews by his patient and sympathetic insight into their ways and by his fearless exposures not only of their greatness but of the more offensive sides of judaism he makes judaismthe judaism which seems to be slowly dying out as the narrow exclusive sect it was intelligible in all its majestic immovability in all its squalid and odious intolerance perhaps no one has ever rendered it so intelligible before sympathetic writers have insisted on the stubbornness of purpose the race and family pride the glorious selfsacrifice for what they hold true which have characterised the jews and their faults have found censorious critics but no one has like mr zangwill fearlessly shown the pathos and the greatness of their squalor and their bigotry and found the secret of their strength even in what renders them most unpopular in christendom ceremony as one of mr zangwills characters here says has been the chief element of their strength another less obvious one which he picks out is the enforced seclusion of the ghetto system which has really only been thoroughly broken down in the present century the bad laws which fastened on them distinctive badges and herded them together in narrow quarters where they saw none but their own coreligionists the insults and persecutions which seemed only to draw them tighter together have all added the strength of martyrdom to their bonds of connexion the removal of these restrictions has already done something to impair the vital unity of the race but not much yet and it remains to be seen if the scepticism and desertions of judaism which are more noticeable now are really anything more than superficial scratches on the system a point which mr zangwill does not notice but which stands out most prominently in his book is the parasitical nature of judaism in the sketch called chad gadya a young venetian jew comes back to venice and makes reflections on the stability of judaism when all the energy and the glory of life which once made venice the great state of the south have departed and he muses on the seeming eternity of judaism when he finds his father living in the palace of some once proud doge or senator that is of course true but he forgets the other point of view that while the proud old venetians gave up all their energy and their wealth to the glorifying of their state the jews a race apart have cared for no country hve made no country great they have flocked where riches were to be found and they have steadily silently selfishly gone on making their private wealth anally to enjoy the half  faded glories in which they had no part the persecutions of the jews are inexcusable but they are explicable from the feeling that all nations have had that they are a race apart who have not the stake in the country which comes from selfsacrifice for it this book is almost entirely concerned with the rebels against ceremony in the jewish foldjews who have been dreamers and have found their souls frozen with the mean ingless jargon and the empty forms which were supposed to make up so much of their livesmen who have tried to burst the bonds but in nearly every case have found themselves either driven back or striving to return to the religion which has guarded them through so many centuries mr zangwill deals with very varied typeswith gay laughterloving heine with the profound philosopher spinoza with the meteor ferdinand lassalle with moses mendelssohn and with sabbatai zevi a messiah who finally turned mohammedan and doorkeeper to the sultan these sketches are not novels they are hardly stories they are as a rule imaginary conversations or isolated incidents in the lives of different people in which their characters stand out translucently a reviewer of mr zangwill said once that he had no human sympathy that his characters do not live there is perhaps a grain of truth in the remark but what would be truer would be to say that all his human sympathy seems merged in judaism as a system he loves it so intensely that though he sees its faults and shows them up he looks on them more as a parent looks on the faults of a favourite child than as a stern critic as he himself justly says in his preface the book is to be looked on as a whole the subject being the old orthodox judaism which all these dreamers play around like flies on a lion as for the sketches themselves the best undoubtedly is that of lassalle the author brings out in a masterly way the stupendous conceit the oriental exuberance of fancy and the marvellous rapidity of execution of this wonderful jew he reminds us much of the glorious and extravagant heroes of disraelis novels or again of harry richmonds father in mr merediths novel heine is good but mr zangwill has fallen into the error which it is difficult to avoid in writing an imaginary conversation of such a wellknown figure he brings in too many allusions to heines own works and employs too many quotations from heine himself consequently the result seems almost too learned to be convincing however it is charming perhaps because there is so much in it of heine himself,northamerica_contra

somewhat hackneyed characters and incidents his story is decidedly ghastly and ho spares neither his characters nor his readers the convict life of the innocent lance is told with much particularity and will certainly try the nerves of an average reader no doubt the author could quote chapter and verse by way of authority and this part of his narrative reads more like reality than some of the rest dr mac donalds present book is rather disappointing that there are highly poetic passages in it goes without saying yet it jg impossible to rate this volume as among his best it is eerie and mysterious with its strange spectral riders on the dark moor and the deep melancholy that seizes the lonely man with whom the child orba lives and that ever and anon drives him out into the inhospitable night but the mystery is too completely solved and the solution comes too near to the ridiculous the idea of a lady on board a ship is quite enough to set mr clark russell off it does not much matter whether the young woman is eloping or meets her hero for the first time in cabin or on deck he has done the thing before in both ways and as the reading public evidently likes a conjunction of neptune and venus from mr clark russell he will doubtless do it many times again the incidents of the  strange elopement  strike one as more improbable than those of any of the authors previous sea novels and the plot is as thin as thin can be but there is a dash of freshness in the narrative from first to last and it will not come amiss to a healthy appetite for novelreading a book dealing with cowboys and storekeepers rowdy emigrants and strange representatives of a spasmodic order and a frequently purblind justice does not raise high hopes but in the straightforward and vivid narrative which introduces the western hero from colorado to the little city in kansas the reader soon loses his slight repugnance to the theme and rapidly becomes interested in the simple story jeff grant is a very sufficient hero the rough life of the west which has strengthened his nerves and trained his eye has not hardened his heart or disqualified him for a more social existence when after an encounter in which he has saved the town apparently from sack at the hands of a  lowdown crowd he goes to visit the wounded prisoner in the laburnum gaol his motives are obscure to the sheriff  this man is very ill sheriff  i believe you he requires careful nursing what medicine are you giving him   none  did the doctor leave nothing  mr searle shrugged his shoulders  nary a drop he said it would be thrown away and he could not afford to physic rowdies  and it werent his business which is a fact of course  you mean he left this man to die  there was a vibration in jeffs voice which mr searle did not like excuse the remark mr grant but i think that you are unhitchin your tongue a leetle bit too free is ham kicks your prisoner or mine  jeff paused to consider the situationhe could have choked mr conrad searle what he did do was to draw from his pocket a piece of green paper which rustled with a pleasant sound how long will it take you to fetch doc quinter here sheriff  it is noteworthy that the same process very liberally applied saves the wretched hara not only from judge lynch but from the slightly more formal operations of regular justice although judge judas cochrane before whom the case was trie 1 had a strong pecuniary interest in his condemnation these methods however by common consent do not detract from though merit of the performance  the man who ll try to cure the wound he gives and stand between the cuss he dropped and a whole township if need be is rarer than a white buffalo there is a contrast between this manly merciful adventurer a gentleman at bottom and the rather supercilious young man from the east his rival in cleos affections but philip improves under reverses and we will hope shakes off some more of his cubbishness in europe whither he betakes himself after his relations with the heroine have been put on a brotherly footing that young person in spite of a squeamishness in the matter of rough clothing which an english lady would have neither felt nor exhibited is a very honest girl and deserves the satisfactory wedding fully detailed which concludes this artless but not uninteresting tale though its fresh local colouring is

  new novels sir bevill by arthur c thynne john lane canon thynne has been more concerned to write a pictorial history of his hero and ancestor sir bevill grenvile than to write a good romance he has evidently made a sincere study of the life and times of grenvile granville or grenville or even greenvu as clarendon has it and those times were stirring enough to interest us again and again but probably the fidelity to fact has militated against the use of imagination the introduction consists of an account of the imprisonment and death of sir john eliot grenvilles friend and eliot comes into the subsequent narrative a good deal the most romantic part of grenvilles life was after his fortyfifth year when he championed the royalist cause in cornwall and helped sir ralph hopton to carry that county for the king into the brief time between then and lansdowne hill where he fell he crowded a chivalrous career and it is for that that he is remembered to  day but we do not reach the civil war until the last few chapters and most of the novel is occupied with sir bevills earlier life this gives canon thynne the chance of discovering his knowledge of cornish ways and cornish folk and of depicting cornish life among the lower classes into episodes illustrative of these is woven the life of sir bevill and his friend eliot like a single strand it is not uninteresting but it is not engrossing there is just sufficient story to carry the romance which reveals in many places the inexpert hand probably if the author had made a dash for it he would have succeeded better for vigour is much in such a case the romance is prefaced by a portrait of sir bevill after vandyck  fiction sir bevill by arthur christopher thynne lane 6s  sir bevill is less a romance than a study of old world westcountry life as such it is altogether delightful setting the reader amid broom and heather on the devon moors or by the sounding sea on the cornish coast the book smacks of the soil and is vivid with the life of place and people we pursue the stag in a great hunt which would have charmed the heart of whyte melville are present at fairs and witchhunts and hear tales of the prowess of richard granville and the great captains of elizabeth though dealing ostensibly with the career of sir bevill granville the story is quite as much a glorification of that other noble cornishman sir john eliot who died in the tower a martyr for liberty and the privilege of parliament we trace the career of the friends from early boyhood and hear much of the romance of bevill with that gentle grace who has left so fragrant a memory all the everyday life is admirably rendered with unconventional simplicity and realism and many of the side characters are brilliantly sketched when it comes to the larger issues the author is less successful he hurries over the political situation his account of the war is given with disproportionate brevity and rendered unconvincing by the inevitable westcountry belief that only westcountrymen counted as leaders despite certain artistic flaws the book is rich in historic knowledge and human feeling and affords a winning picture of the loyal sir bevill,northamerica_contra

house of still greater antiquity and distinction than his own clandestinely though nobody would have been better pleased with the match than his parents this occurred at the commencement of the french

davrancourt is discovered the lady is understood to be in the family way and to save the scion of their son no time is lost in flying to paris though too late to save the mother the child is miraculously rescued and identified marked on the breast with a bloody hand stamped by the mothers terrors before its birth at the sight of her fiathers murder she herself was guillotined betrayed by

bloodthirsty frenchman recovering however the youth now sets out a campaigning and in his absence folks are busy at homeespecially a match making dame of quality who has two girls to dispose of to prevent his marriage with the parsons daughter and secure the prize for one of her own she continues to keep up a little interesting correspondence with him and so successfully that on his return two

making previously a confidant of the duke of york he departs in spite of all remonstrance on the part of the roxmeres who would have had him stay at homne and take to lucy again but his destiny must be run in spain he is taken prisoner and while with the french army he comes in contact with his french enemy who being in favour and power readily gets him into his own hands but instead of killing

  hovel 1motes a market bundle by a xeil lyons 7s thornton lbutterworth the humour of mr neil lyons is a ripe and rare vintage it cannot be described by comparison because it is peculiarly his own the humour is less in his incidents than in his manner of presenting them it is chiefly the humour of character and of his own whimsical outlook upon the motley world of men and women or upon that side of it in which he has staked his claim high life is not his province but he knows common and ordinary people respectable and unrespectable with an amazing intimacy and like old izaac with his worms handles them as if he loved them he does not trouble to invent a plot for everything he touches turns to a story in his hands and he is as much at home among village folk rural carpenters gardeners pedlars and the drifting flotsam of the countryside as among the miscellaneous cockneys that inhabit the mean streets of london here for the most part he pictures the humours and occasionally the pathos of country life and character with intermittent excursions to town and gives glimpses of little episodes that arose in both places out of the late war as in the delightful sketches of  the german from perhaps  representing the platoon and  private jupps mission everything in all the stories depends on the humour and the art with which they are told the humour is as shrewd as it is quaint and kindly and is touched elusively at times with a sense of tears the art is exquisitely simple and effective and both are inseparable from the personality of the author it is not often one lights upon a book of short stories so intensely human and amusing and so fine in workmanship as are those in  a market bundle,northamerica_contra
  the wingless victory by m p willocks lane 6s mr john lane is to be congratulated on having discovered miss willocks and if her latest work is not a great success it will not be creditable to the discernment of the reading public miss willocks is the stylist of the emotions she knows the moods and temperaments of both sexes and while we saw this in her first novel  widdicombe that book was after all only the promise of which  the wingless victory  is the fulfilment the story is really simple dealing with primitive persons in unalluring surroundings it is a case of one woman and three men or perhaps two men and a boy for archelaus rouncewell is scarcely old enough to be classified as a man when he falls under the influence of wilmot borlace the eccentric syren whose character dominates the book she has married mainly because she is tired of single life and although the union with the village doctor starts without any love on her side she has an idea that she can make him into a hero what opportunities for heroism he could have found in a dull cornish village it is difficult to say but wilmot is nevertheless disappointed and after a dangerous flirtation with archelaus  takes on  with a roger hannaford and is about to elope with him when conscience aided by the intervention of a disreputable woman johanna saves her and she returns to her husband repentant and ashamed then follows a period of penance for dr borlace has to leave challacombe and he deliberately selects another village where there is a plague of sickness here wilmot works out her salvation and when the end of the book is reached we find that everybody concerned has also come to a haven of rest and satisfaction this is necessarily a very brief sketch of the plot but it will suffice to show that miss willocks depends more upon her own skill in delineating and analysing character than in describing the sensational or the morbid the fact that she has not avoided the conventional happy ending and has yet been successful indicates her genuine strength a writer who can justify the conventional is an artist in words and miss willocks deserves this distinction she can be epigrammatic without being superficial and she can moralise without being prosy her descriptions of scenery are amongst the finest passages in the book even if they fall short of her incisive phrases when dealing with the small hypocrisies of human minds one sentence may be quoted  that summing up the fanatical devotion which we call  a mothers love mrs rouncewell one of the subsidiary characters is made to say every new child a woman gets is like a new patent medicine she always thinks it will do something wonderful for her and it never does miss willocks will be told that she shows the hardy influence but this will be an injustice talent such as hers was not and never could be acquired in any of the readymade schools of fiction it bears the stamp of originality  the wingless victory by m p willcocks john lane miss willcocks has followed up the success of her 4 widdicombe by a westcountry story which abounds in striking studies of character and real observation of human emotions she is bold here and there in her treatment of sex and seems to have been influenced by ibsen but her boldness is justified the two chief characters are introduced to us as a wedded pair the woman has made a manage de convenance or one might say de curiosite while the man is a doctor full of strength and uncouth oddity she is wilful and alluringone of those small dark women who suggest spanish blood the story tells how they won through much trouble to full understanding of the minor characters those who indulge frankly in western dialect are the bestindeed very good the author has certainly produced a notable novel as well as a good story it seems to us somewhat clogged by overelaboration of style and metaphor some of the descriptions of scenery are pretty enough but not really to the point they remind us of the glorious nineties when young men and women ran riot in metaphors and analogies not to speak of fine writing miss willcocks is better educated than many of them but too fond of moralizing  rovel

on behalf of religious liberty in the low countries before he left leyden with the puritans though he never joined their church he was the staunch iend and sworn defender of that little band of heroic men and women who landed from the may flower in now egland in the year 1620 as the best linguist among the pirim squalified to treat with the indians and s the bet soldier he took the command in their expeditions  his capital exploit s the old chronicle terms it was the salvation of the planters at weymouth from extermination the hostility of the india had been provoked by the injustice of some greedy london adventurers who were striving to monopolise the advantages of the fur trade the colony was saved by the wiadom and courage of miles standish he died in 1656 at the age of seventytwo he was twice married and the tradition has been handed down that some time after the death of his first wife he employed the friendly services of one john alden to pay court in his name to a fair lady who however fell in love with his ambassador and priscilla mullins became the wife of john alden that courtship is the subject of professor longfellows new poem which tells how a brave and passionate campaigner the captaiu of plymouth read julius cmi3ar while his friend the fairhaired scholar and lover hiding the secret of his own heart went forth vainly to plead the cause of miles standish with the puritan maiden priscilla so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand came to an open space and saw the disc of the ocean sailless sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east wind saw the newbuilt house and people at work in a meadow heard as he drew near the door the musical voice of priscilla ainging the hundredth psalm the grand old puritan anthem music that luther sang to the sacred words of the psalmist full of the breath of the lord consoling and comforting many then as he opened the door he beheld the form of the maiden seated beside her wheel and the carded wool like a snowdrift piled at her knee her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle while with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion open wide on her lap lay the wellworn psalmbook of ainsworth printed in amsterdam the words and the music together roughhewn angular notes like stones in the wall of a churchyard darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses such was the book from whose pages she sang the old puritan anthem she the puritan girl in the solitude of the forest making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun beautiful with her beauty and rich with the wealth of her being so he entered the house and the hum of the wheel and the singing suddenly ceased for priscilla aroused by his step on the threshold rose as he entered and gave him her hand in signal of welcome saying  i knew it was you when i heard your step in the passage for i was thinking of you as i sat there singing and spinning awkward and dumb with delight that a thought of him had been migled thus in the ad psalm that came from the heart of the maiden silent before her he stood and gave her the flowers for an answer fidin no words for his thought he remembered that day in the winter after the first great snow when he broke a path from the village reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house and laughed at his snowy locks and gave him a seat by the fireside grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snowstorm had he but spoken then perhaps not in vain had he spoken now it was all too late  the golden moment had vanished so he stood there abashed and gave her the flowers for an answer john alden did his duty by his friend but as he warmed and glowed in his simple and eloquent language quite forgetful of self and full of the praise of his rival archly the maiden smiled and with eyes overruning with laughter said in a tremulous voice  why dont you speak for yourself john  0 here was for the true heart of the puritan youth temptation of satan he plunged into the wood he saw the mayflower at anchor  rocked on the rising tide 1 and ready to ail on the morrow there was the  hand  of the lord he would put satan behind him  back will i go oer the ocean this dreary land will abandon her whom i may not love and him whom my heart has offended better to be inmy grave in the green old churchyard in england clos by my mothers side and among the dust of my kindred better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor sacred and safe and unseen in the dark of the narrow chamber with me my secret shall lie like a buried jewel that glimmers bright on the hand that is dust in the chambers of silence and darknesyes as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter the redoubtable captain of plymouth choked with rage when john alden faithfully repeating all that bad been said came to the last words in his story but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway bringing in uttermost haste a mesaa of urgent importance rumours of dangerand war and hostile incursions of indians straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron buckled the belt round his waist and frownig fiercely departed alden was left alone he heard the clank of the scabbard growing fainter and fainter and dying aa in the distance then heg roes from his seat and looked forth into the darkness felt the cool air blow on his cheek that was hot with the insult lifted his eyes to the heavens and folding his hands as in childhood prayed in the silence of night to the father who seeth in seret meanwhile the choleric captain strode wrathful away

glistening savage bearing the serpents skin and seeming hmuself like a serpent winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest the captain marched and the mayflower sailed but john alden did not return home in her for as he stood with one foot upon her boat he saw priscilla fixed were her eyes upon his as if she divined his intention fixed with a look so sad so reproachful imploring and patient that with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose as from the verge of a crag where one step more is destruction strange is the heart of man with its quick mysterious instincts strange is the life of man and fatal or fated are moments whereupon turn as on hinges the gates of the wall adamantine 0 strong hearts and true not one went back in the

but while they spake with each other pointing with outstretched hands and saying look he had vanished between the puritan youth and the puritan maid a little talk in the crowd followed they went home as friends together and he on the way told her his own despair and the direful wrath of miles standish whereat the maiden smiled and said between laughing and earnest  he is a little chimney and heated hot in a moment  but as he gently rebuked her and told her how much he had sufferedhow he had even determined to sail that day in the may flower and had remained for her sake on hearing the dangers that threatenedall her manner was changed and she said with a faltering accent  truly i thank you for this how good you have been to me always  thus as a pilgrim devout who toward jerusalem journeys taking three steps in advance and one reluctantly backward urged by importunate zeal and withheld by pangs of contrition slowly but steadily onyw  receding yet ever advancing journeyed this

snowwhite steer nay she should ride like a queen not plod along like a peasant somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband

in the name f of hexameter sing song and relies for effect almost wholly  on the fixed position of the two last accents in each line accords well with the spirit of the poem english verse depends so entirely upon accent that professor longfellow has no reon to concern himself though it be hexameter he writes about the length of syllables who can tell for emple why in a line like this merrily sang

stamp the superscription of a poet yet let us own that it is well apted to the purpose of professor longfellow who writes not for the few but for the many and whose power over a vast army of readers lies in the steadiness with which he abides by the level of the weaker wit giving the charm of his own refined taste to commonplace reflection he never ventures upon thought of which the perfect meaning is not obvious to all men of ordinary apprehension he is glad to escape from the intricacies into which he might be led by a too perfect crystallisation of his verse and in a singsong that permits the utmost easiness of expression he can walk at the level of all ordinary thoughts and cares using the homeliest words when it so pleases him and using them with the rae tact of a true poet for the same reason this poem of miles standish like other of professor longfellows works abounds in iteration words or thoughts on which he would have us dwell recur lines are repeated as they were by the old ballad writers who had a rude audience to sing to and took good care not to puzzle them or let them over look in any portion of its course the main thread of their story the rhetorical artifice derives its beauty from the clearness with which it tends to lay open the heanr of any subject to the meanest apprehension it is this poets evident determination never to write what shall be caviare to the multitude all men can feel but few can think all men can assent gladly to what they know to be a truth and there are high truths known of all familiarly and current through the language of the people in a stream of acceptable commonplaces professor longfellow asks for no new effort of thought he takes the good he finds upon the common way and makes its beauty visible if it be a defect in him to possess little of the subtlety that has distinguished the worlds greatest poets we may say that he owes to that defect some part of his great popularity but from the weaker men who have earned popularity by a dexterity in utterance of the best class of commonplaces professor longfellow is widely parted for he truly has the heart of a poet and the fine taste of a scbolar  the

best of our ability we have endeavoured to appreciate him and in that endeavour have taken up as he bids us  with a heart for every fate successive pieces of his we have more than once tried to extricate the plot of  the spanish student to unravel the intention  of the golden legend and to feel satisfied j with the treatment of evangelinebut in all these poems we have constantly felt that we were  not achieving but pursuing and that no reasonable versifier ought to ask his critics or even his readers from time to time to  learn to labour and to wait the burden which the previous sorrows of mr longfellow laid upon us was really as great as we could bear under the addition of the last volume slight though it be the most benevolent reader however well disposed towards sorrow will timi it difficult to acquiesce judging from his poems our conception of mr longfellow for some time has been that he is an invalid poet who is morbidly partial to what has been called  the nightside of nature it is his fantastic pleasure to lie upon a bed of faded roses which are tinged by the illusive light of a very watery moon  within his breast he informs us  there is re no light but the cold light of stars syste lc matically and apparently from poetic principle tl he avoids everything of a cheerful and en it couraging tone listening only for  voices of tithe night for  inuftied drums beating funeral of marches for the footsteps of weak ghosts which co seem doomed to walk the earth and make an tin appearance when summoned for the purposes ob of poetry with more of sorrow than of

bund or lachrymose kind there is in his st immediate fancy either a chapel or a cloister fo  which he employs not for any specific religious ca  office but as an interesting object or motive to ai 1 sentiment hence he has the unusual luxury p 1 of hearing a bell tolling at intervalshe imagines friars chanting  solemn masses singing a  pray for this poor soul and is enabled  to ly suffer and be

and cold c   and ghastly full of ruins of fires and graves   and wrecksor a world of feeble twilight i  where the embracing sunbeams chastely play t  equally dismal is his world of persons the 1  principal tendency of his poems is to make his   characters fall in love  and the issue to actor   and reader is invariable disappointment weak   love and romantic patience are the agents  i  which mr longfellow chiefly employs in this   service for hearts and souls in lamentable    attitudes and under inconceivably painful cir i j cunistances he solicits public emotionfor i a nameless  struggling

of distress of mind and bener diet bellefontaine the poor young ladys father o is in his last stage a sad instance of distress ie both of body and estate why all this wretchn edness should be thought

protractedfellow has u  ordained this distress for the sake of a subsc fis quent piece of description or as the vehicle for  ly one or two exceedingly moral speeches the le reader feels that he has been very unworthily ie even allowing that he has been poetically ij practised upon n nor do the exhortations to calmness and resignation which are so plentiful in mr longfellow make us other than lugubrious they are uttered in so melancholy a tone that it is quite impossible for the reader to believe they are meant when the old priest by way of consoling evangeline for the unaccountable conduct of her lover informs the young lady that  affection never is wasted it is quite obvious that his meaning is and the event proves that she should continue to waste her affection which the poor girl like too many of her sex deluded unhappily does that odd youth too whose brow is sad and whose  blue eye beneath are we correct in understanding his eyelid flashes like a falchion from its sheathwho for no apparent reason carries a banner with a strange device utters in a very weak way through a number of stanzas rather bad latin and ultimately is found  lifeless yet serene in the twilight can he be considered by any sensible reader as anything but a very sad and most unfortunate poetical instance   the psalm of life which the heart of an t american young juan is supposed to be capable of repeating to the psalmist cannot with any justice be called an encouraging poem allusions to deith dust the grave muffled drums funeral marches soldiers perishing the dead past burying its dead and shipwrecked mariners are in our opinion images calculated to deter any reader from a desire to make his life in the least sublime and to leave so dismal a world as rapidly as he can never troubling himself as to his footprints in fact mr longfellows admonitions remind us of mr snodgrasss entreaties to his seconds dont call in the police said mr snodgrass  promise me you wont of course not replied mr tupnian dont despair from reading my poems exclaims mr longfellow to his readers  of course not replies the reader it is in its feeble fftoc rather than in its forms or metres that the vice of mr longfellows poetry lies these last are pretty imitations  but never can be mistaken for the original types of tegner goethe heine or chamisso t indeed if we compare the moonlight scenes of s evangeline with the truthful daylight pictures  of the  herman and dorothea or auerbachs  delicious barflissieif we set the golden  legend bv chaniissos poem or with goethes i faustthe building of the ship beside  the lay of the bellthe ballads by those  of heinethe difference between a composition i and an originalbetween reality and fantasy  is painfully evident  mr longfellow is not one of the poets in  whom gods or men can take much pleasure  our principal objection to him is that he is so a unobjectionable a writer his poems do not  stir exalt and strengthen us they only make  men continually passiveand women continually sr resignedwe do not believe in his vapoury  elysium and cannot reduce our imagination to  the level of his earth i not for men however does the american  poet gracefully rise and take down his shal dowy harp from the willows he is especially ir the young ladies poet for them to an old  german or swedish tune he adapts his melody o yet we doubt if even his most enamoured y readers will feel what mr longfellow calls is  the spell of glamour in consequence of the c present performance  evangeline with all ir i its faults was not wanting in a certain underle glow of poetic light  hiawatha to a certain extent might be pronounced poetical and by the aid of music it was possible to acquire a taste even for  a rainy day and one or two of the smaller poems how the author could be so careless of his reputation as to put forth n the greater part of the poetry which makes up fr this last volume we cannot at all understand d sad though it bc to think it has been written w it is sadder to know that it has been published e and must be reviewed w yet mr longfellow in some degree relieves  h us of a disagreeable duty by pleading guilty and a pronouncing judgement upon himself a mun  ber of classical and modern examples were  before him  full of promptings and sugges s tiona he recalls a suggestion t of prometheus how undaunted  on olympuss shining bastions j  his audacious foot he planted subsequently there occurs to him the fate  of r milton and cervantes  t natures priests and ru1ante i by affliction touched and saddened a very natural question then presents itself j to the poetnamely this what is the use of perseverance in the art of poetry the occupation being laborious and the end in a worldly point of view too

in the american people might form a worthy subject for a drama or an epic the sailing of the mayflower and the lauding of the pilgrim fathers are events surely far greater in results and better capable of being poetized than the sailing of the argo or the wanderings of ulysses all that the genius of mr longfellow can elicit from them is matter for an exceedingly weak and protracted lovestory

ultimately forgave is fully related ia hexameter verse the opening lines of though poem introduce capt miles in boots of cordovan leather buried in thought with his hands behind him and striding to

but looked not up from his writing the captain persisted in conversation de scribing what could be seen from the window there aro my soldiers my great invincible army i twelve men all equipped having each his rest and his i matchlock i eighteen shillings a month together with diet and pillage after informing his friends that he was quite j ready for the indians and  the sooner they j try it the

the hurrying  pen of the stripling after john alden had  folded the last of his letters capt standish i relieves his heart by a communication as  follows tis not good for a man to be alone say the scriptures this i have said before and again and again i repeat it  every hour in the day i think it and feel it and say it since rose standish died my life has been weary and  dreary i sick at heart have i been beyond the healing of friendship  oft in my lonely hours have i thought of the maiden i priscilla  she is alone in the world her father and mother and brother  died in the winter together  i saw her going and coming i now to the grave of the dead and now to the bed of thu   dying patient courageous and strong and said to myself that i if ever   there were angels on earth as there are angels in heaven two have i seen and known and the angel whose name is priscilla holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned long have i cherished the thought but never have dared  to reveal it j being a coward in this though valiant enough for the most part go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest malden of riv mouth say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier sot in these words you know but this in short is my meaning i am a maker of war and not a maker of phrases the reason of his not making the proposal in proprid persona the captain thus explains i can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender  but march up to a woman with such a proposal i dare not  j im not afraid of bullets nor shot from the mouth of a   cannon  i but of a thundering no pointblank from the mouth  i of a woman  1 i that i confess im afraid of nor am i ashamed to confess  1  it   now john alden is in lovewithpriscilla him self and as he passes into the woods where bluebirds and robins were building towns in the  populous treeshe has a conflict with himself friendship however gains the day and he j pleads the cause of his friend the maiden asks very naturally why the captain sends an  ambassador at all i i then john alden began explaining and smoothing the matter  making it worse as he went by saying the captain was busy had no time for such thingssuch things the words grating harshly fell on the ear of priscilla and swift as a flash she made answer  has he no time for such things as you call it before he is married would he be likely to find it or make it after the wedding  that is the way with you men  you dont understand us you cannot the ambassador argues that the captain is of good family and gives his name and address he was a gentleman born could trace his pedigree plainly back to hugh standish of duxbury hall in lancashire england who was the son of ralph and the grandson of thurston de standish a young lady might think him undersized but he was not to be laughed at and scorned because he was little of stature for he was great of heart magnanimous

  r js mother and some other people by margaret deland bs harpers the six short stories which make up the present volume have evidently been reprinted from the betterclass american magazines they are indeed very typical of the american short storycarefully written even delicate pathetic and occasionally almost tragic but never quite the nearest approach to tragedy is to be found in a black drop the tale of an american young man who loves a white girl with a drop of black blood in her veins the story works up hints about the clash of race instincts give the reader a sense of doom he expects something and then the whole affair simply fizzles out anticlimax in real life is always tragic or humorous this is neither the men in these stories seem to marry because they want sonei one to take care of the women because they want some one to manage they are people floating on a swirl of currents or lying in backwaters rather than swimmers striking out for themselves is it so in america  one closes the book with a sense of disappointment owning however at the same time that it has been very pleasant rcadingi,northamerica_contra

  the wheel o fortune by louis tracy ward lock 6s the adventures of dick royson in search of a mysterious buried treasure in an african desert are conventional enough but mr tracy writes sufficiently well to make his book interesting reading the young man is introduced to us as he watches a procession of the unemployed he too is out of employment a timely carriage accident however provides him with an opportunity of displaying his prowess and as a result he is engaged by baron von kerber to be the second mate of the aphrodite the yacht which is carrying mr fanshawe his daughter mrs haxton captain stump and his crew to africa royson is the heir to a baronetcy and a large income but this fact is kept a secret to miss fanshawe and the reader until the proper time for its publication meanwhile royson falls in love with miss fanshawe of course and it also follows that his proposal comes before the knowledge of his change of fortune reaches him this is all part of the modern novelists extreme fondness for proving the sincerity of his hero and heroine however the lovemaking forms a small part only of  the wheel o fortune all the mystery surrounding buried treasure is drawn upon for surprise and countersurprise  the interest in the baron and mrs haxton is worked up to a strong pitch but in the end the author has very little to tell of them an author should see that he can manufacture a good solution as well as a good mystery and mr tracys weakest spot is the conclusion of his story mr tracy is by now a wellknown writer of sensational novels and his latest book whilst striking no new line or probing deeply into the problems of life is a good specimen of the storynovel pure and simple we have met many dick roysons before and they have performed many of the feats mr tracy describes that fact however will not trouble the authors readers they like a readable exciting story and in  the wheel o fortune  they will get it,northamerica_contra

  the wonderful adventures of tuflongbo and his elfin company in their journey with little content through the enchanted forest children s books by holme lee with illustrations smith elder  cowe may as well make our confession before we begin our criticism we took up these  adventures of tuflongbo with a great contempt for parvenu fairies and new settlers in fairyland where we spent the days of our childhood indeed we were honoured with the intimate companionship of all the real old fairies and their godchildren we were brought up amongst the fairies of the ancien rlyime and we were not disposed to transfer our allegiance but we gradually became interested in the fortunes of the heroic tuflongbo though he came of quite a modern family and was nothing like such a fine gentleman os the beautiful prince in the white cat or prince riquet with the tuft or prince fortunatas indeed he was quite vulgarly able to take care of himself and did not  need a fairy godmother at all but his adventures j interested us more and more as we went on and i though we are old enough to have known better we confess that from the moment we began to read j we never laid down the book until we came to the last page and we like tuflongbo quite as well as any of the ancient old heroes of fairy tales and we hope he never came to any harm and we would be very glad to hear more about him and we hope holme lee will make haste and tell us about his further history holme lee may be satisfied with her day8 work for she has written a very charming book full of fancy and good feeling and most readers will feel regret when they come to the end of it nevertheless we have a little criticism to j offer in the first place there are too many chai racters and the incidents are confused the story j would have been better if it had been broken up i into several stories the journey through the j enchanted forest of stone is very good though it gets too much into allegory but after the j adventurers get back to fairyland the story i becomes confused and rather heavy the trial of j tuflongbo for high treason is not managed accord ing to the precedents of fairy tales it might be j the report of a case in the central criminal court in the latter part there are too many allusions to incidents and personages of other stories and readers like to feel that they have a complete story it is not treating them well to allude to matters which do not enter into the story before them it is like talking of family affairs before visitors and making them feel they are strangers there is no poetical justice executed upon aunt spite and libelia and we need not remark that 1 in fairy tales we expect the strictest punishment j for the wicked characters it would be an imi provement if holme lee would forget that she is  writing in the nineteenth century and make her  j fairies a little less like the reasonable and rational   beings we meet with in the novels of miss young f j and miss sewel fairies and the dwellers in  j fairyland have always been a peculiar people but 1 their morals were of the very simplest and theil  chroniclers had a simplicity and unconscious1 i ness of intention which is one great point in which i i the old fairy tales and old nursery rhymes surpass  j in grace and attraction all that have followed in  their track it will be observed that we have not j said one word to give an idea of what the story is about we should consider it a breach of confidence  and no persuasion shall induce us to tell what readers may learn for themselves,northamerica_contra
  literature fre8h leaves and green pastures px the author of  leaves from a life eveleigh nash they frith memoirs continue to expand the veteran academicians daughterwho still preserves a rather futile incognito having devastated her london friends and acquaintance in her amusing leaves from a life now carries her raids into the country and especially into the  island  of purbeck wiith which she has been connected for half a century judging from the impressions produced by her revelations of london life we can easily believe that she  must have been as she admits  a regular dispensation to the place  mr stephen gwynn in his latest book describes himself and his fellow nationalist members as  militant insects we fancy he means white corpuscleswho perform a useful if annoying mission in destroying noxious political bacilli the author of fresh leavess evidently played a similar part in the quiet sleepy old world into which like a torpedo she plunged on her marriage i hit out right and left and made as much mischief and so many enemiesfor which i did not care one jotthat i can only compare those first years to the time spent by a wounded animal in a trap she  swore and declared  that she would not submit to the dictation of the gounty though profoundly happy in her lifecompanion i do not think any one was ever so miserable in the whole world as i was when i had been married about a couple of years and understood what i had let myself in for as long as i could get about with my husbani and we were left alone things were right enough but when i became a mother my life was one long nightmare the simple fact was that the sudden change from a remarkably vivacious household and all the varieties of london amusements to the deadly quiet of domestic routine in a peculiarly oldfashioned tory and churchy society was like a header into a wintery sea a liberal she  could not away with  the domination of the squires and to her capacious theological tolerationa more graceful way of expressing intolerancethe rule of the church was even worse the beloved old rector notwithstanding she was never fond of parsons of whom  i think the less said the better  and she tels with relish the familiar story of the rector  who used to climb to where he could see the kitchenchimneys of seven small manorhouses smoking on sunday and used to claim his dinner where much smoke promised a lordly feed possibly the clergy might retort that a lady who writes of the second commandment  as the one relating to the observance of the sabbath is hardly a competent authority on matters ecclesiastical but the author has now repented of her rebellion i was too young to know the perfect passion old people have for any association  i could see nothing good in old ways which appeared merely outofdate nuisances to me and above all i was appalled by the manner in which every single thing i did and indeed things which i did not do were discussed gossiped over and talked about till i felt as if i lived under a microscope with the eye of a fiend i should much like to know why we one and all of us learn everything in life just too late to be of the smallest use1 the changing views of experience however have not prevented her from giving an exceedingly piquant yet unmistakably true picture of county and countytown life as it was forty or fifty years ago she writes as she talks we imagine in a clever ramblingillogical way with the weirdest to use her favourite adjective punctuation and amazingly constructed sentences but all her vagaries of style and exaggerations do not spoil her book the picture is depressing because it is all vanished now and the death of a town or the disappearance of a venerated class is at least as pathetic as the death of a man the seven county families including it seems all mr hardys  group of noble dames who  ruled the place all more or less kind if they had their own way where are they now the old estates are let to shooting tenants the old manor houses have become farmers dwellings or schools the old rectories are in the occupation of  casuals  who use them for summer holidays the old squires who used to ride to elections at the head of their wellmounted obsequious tenant farmers are dead and gone and even in the town where there once were a score of families worth visiting  there are only about four people who could by the utmost stretch of courtesy be called gentlefolk the writer it will be perceived is as candid as ever personally i bitterly regret the passing of the old squire true when he was bad he was very very bad as the poet hath it but when he and his were good there goodness was widereaching and the whole countryside was the better for their kindly if autocratic care1 there is in these leaves a sufficientll lurid account of the very very bad squire who in addition to rather rampant habits had some delicate fancies such as keeping his mausoleum warmed ready for his reception and drilling his gamekeepers to carry his coffin with even step so that he should not be jolted on his last journey his conduct however reduced his elderly daughter to the melancholy occupation of  winding all the clocks to mark the passing of the sorrowful hours so that they should never be an instant different from each other as perfect a suggestion of dreary misery as can well be conceived there is another story of the squire on the bars up the chimney to evade an intrusive husband which is more cheerful but the general obliteration of the old ways touches the author deeply and she says truly enough that it is not at all certainly  a good thing to have known a place and people for so many many years as i have done the timespirit has jogged their arms and reminded them that they are now but survivals of a time when a man could do as he liked with his own so as the beautiful silence is broken by gramophones and motorhorns and the exquisite cliffs deformed by obtrusive buildings the manor turns its back on all and the old inhabitants are off if they cannot rule they will abdicate despite the fact that at least a hundred people will be miserable for their departure and another village will be left derelict because the head once gone there is no one to keep things together in the good old wey it is sad to see the death of an era and i doubt if anything will replace the real  county folk who are rapidly ceasing to exist i liked their calm benevolence myself admired their absolute certainty of their superiority to the rest of the world and if i laughed at them their queer garments their hideous furniture and their assumption i should not do so now i should not have done so had i understood them and known how they loved their own people and land tyrants maybe now and then still they tried to do their best and i for one mourn over their rapid passing but the author does not confine her chronicles to the  county she has a vivid picture of the old town life where the furniture was not always hideous and where a svres teaservice  the fellow of which was made for marie antoinette crown derby and worcester dinner china and charles ii silver were not unknown though their value was the life was not intellectualthe women talked of their nurseries their gardens their poultry and their neighbours but quite in a different way from the manner in which they discuss these matters now the children were not examined critically and scientifically tempers were tempers and not nerves heredity had not come into sight gurgling  moderators  with colza oil restricted evening occupations and  saveails were ued for economy of candleends the housewives of that day were actual slaves first to the men of the house and afterwards to their things  which they washed up themselves  not one of the genthmen was ever either c willing or able to join the ladies after dinner t the ladies saw each other home if fine i with pinnedup skirts goloshes on their feet a knitted shawls and clouds tied over their t curls and immense cloaks over au if wet they departed in relays in  the brougham from the bear  for all the world like the ladies of  cranford or  emma indeed the author herself in her garrulity though not in  humility sometimes reminds us of miss bates one had to be denominational in such a society avd we can sympathise  with the newcomer of whom the godly old lady said  if only she were a christian i could love her when she heard that i did not take in the sunday magazines there was another wonderful old lady i was one of twentyone my dear who never was known to sit in an easy chair as indeed none of our grandmothers ever did if they had any selfrespect there was also an ungodly young woman who played ball with her rolledup handkerchief in the family pew but she had soon to be  removed whilst another of the inhabitants had a trick of dropping asafetida down the letterbox of a lady whom she disliked chapel manners were as remarkable as those in the funny old church under the  beloved rector one deacon let down the chandelier with a run and scattered the candles and the congregation to spite his colleague and a wealthy man being justly rebuked for putting a penny in the soupplate came next sunday with a douibte handful of coppers which he smashed down with such energy that the plate was broken and the collection dispersed in all directions to the profit of sundry small boys the book is full of delightful glimpses of manners good and bad but we cannot quote more we can only refer to the spirited account of elections in the old days the night funerals of the great families the custom of telling the masters death to the  charming  bees the manner of curing whoopingcough by a hair from the cross on a donkeys back the customs and privileges of the marblequarrymen on easter monday and the mode of paying bills in kind there was at least one admirable trait of country society in those times there were three subjects which were never discussed in my early days and i cannot but think this silence was a wise thing they were the state of ones purse the state of ones body and the state of ones soul it was a sound rule and so wve

  old court life in france by frances elliot 2 vols chapman  hall there are few subjects better worth treating than the one now taken in hand by mrs elliot thc majority of english readers even those who have travelled abroad and lived in paris are lut imperfectly acquainted with the old court life of france they know something but little of the names of certain kings they know nothing or what is popularly called next to nothing of the people who surrounded those kings and who were often less puppets than movers and impellers of the sovereign such courtlife details present themselves to most readers as the scenes of a new drama on a subject if not entirely novel yet strange and attractive to an audience wearied with authors and actors who year after year go on thrashing the same modicum of chaff in such dramas as this court life there is great splendour com bined with much variety mrs elliots history is not strictly  history she makes her characters speak aa she imagines they would be likely to speak and we must say that mrs elliots imaginative powers are considerable she indulges in such writing as we find in sensation novels and allows us to witness a very liberal quantity of caressing and kissing which we dare say took place as described or ought to have taken place and so is artistically put in but when  stopping her mouth with kisses  is in the foreground of these courtlife incidents hardened as we are our modesty gets somewhat alarmed and wonders with trembling as to what the next stage direction may lead us to infer mrs elliots volumes begin with francis the first and close with louis the fourteenth the former king has always appeared to us as a fortunate ruffian who has had honour far beyond his deserts except valour of a certain sort he had not a single virtue and what would a man be without  the manly heart courage 1 louis the fourteenth was more of a gentleman in his vices than francis the valour of the grand monarque however was not of such a heroic nature as flatterers have proclaimed it to be louis southeast plaint de sa grandeur qui lattache aa rivage was not meant for satire but nothing more sarcastic was ever uttered it might have been said by a courtfool instead of by a courtly poet like boileau there is if the word be permitted a  rascalry  about most of the fine gentlemen who figure in the old court life francis the first could praise the virtue which he could not prize  her soul is as a rose without a thorn he said of his wife claude whom he killed by his brutal indifference mrs elliot truly says of the position of diana de poictiers mistress of the king and next of his son that nothing can more mark the freedom of the times than this liaison and she speaks of diana as being  one of the brightest ornaments of the court the royal mistress was in truth as beautiful a piece of shabbiness as ever lived but morals were in a very confused state francis who after his capture at pavia said or is suppose to have said all is lost except honour stooped to tell a lie in order to get free and according to mrs elliot his sister marguerite prompted the chivalrous monarch to that unchivalrous act when mary stuart appears upon the scene there is a sense of a pleasant change but mrs elliot might have made more of her that hapless queen never looks so bright as when saying smart things against catherine de medicis the marquis de bouilli has noted some of them in his  history of the dukes of guise mary took especial delight in expressing her contempt for catherine as belonging to a family that had been in trade perhaps mrs elliot has been afraid to say of marguerite de navarre all that was to be said and indeed it would make the hair stand on end to read it  she lives in a world of intrigue is a mild form of speech by which to describe one side of the life of this orthodox and erotic lady while to say that  she pendulates between henri de guise and le molle and a thousand other flirtations is a form indicating a certain regularity in a life which was altogether irregular we confess to little or no admiration for most of these people we do not feel any remarkable reverence for that vert galant henri quatre nor do we acquiesce in mrs elliots judgement as to the feminine tenderness of henris mistress gabrielle destrees the mother of henris son the duke of vendome in succeeding chapters the romance of history is not so well told as the history without the romance in the count de st aulaires  histoire de la fronde and when we come to the period of louis the fourteenth we hardly know which are the worse the showy swaggering men or the audacious shameless women lauzun was the typical frenchman of a long period there are a few exceptionally good individuals who occasionally turn up in the moving crowds at the court of louis the fourteenth and ono la valliere who like the young augustine thought pleasure should come before repentance a scene between the lady and louis the fourteenth will give the reader au idea of what we may call the subdued lovestyle of the writer in which she calls in the imagination of her readers to endorse her own   pressed by the king to grant him some mark of her favour la valliere becomes so confused she cannot reply louis grows more and more pressing interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit in the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder again bursts forth and poor louise overcome at once by fear love and remorse swoons away the king naturally receives the precious burden in his arms he seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his attendants in order to obtain assistance ever and anon he stops in the openings of the forest to admire her as she lies calm and lovely in repose her long eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheeks her halfclosed lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth i leave my readers to imagine if louis did not imprint a few kisses on the fainting beauty ho bears so carefully in his arms and if now and then he did not press her beloved form closer to his breast if in this he did take advantage of thc situation chance bad afforded him he must be forgiven  he was young and he was deeply in love words cannot describe the surprise felt by la valliere on recovering to find herself alone born along in the kings arms in the midst of a lonely forest history does not however record that she died of terror or that she even screamed  but perhaps and indeed doubtless she would have done so had not the respectful behaviour of the king reassured her  old court life in france old court life in france by frances elliot chapman and hall historical romance is the handmaid of history even when history has emancipated itself from the level details of the old chroniclers and lives for us in the pages of a macaulay or a froude with something of the passions and changing interests of real humanity there yet remains a place for the historical romance history i3 by profession at least impartial its backward gaze is too comprehensive to allow minute portraiture its aims are too lofty to admit of any but the widest sympathy the nation or the individual as he contributes to the national life is the historians theme in his true function he is a methodioal accountant taking stock of the past who omits nothing balances the errors of one man against the failings of another the greatness of one state against the ambition of another adds nothing to and takes nothing from the facts and figures that lie before him and finally presents the world with his estimate of results in however perfect a manner this operation be performed it is evident that there is yet room for the historical romance rightly composed the romance clothes its heroes with no more living and personal interest than they possessed ra the flesh  but it contrives by a due subordination of details an artful grouping of the principal figures and a light as of the natural heavens thrown on the picture from above to make the whole world appear subservient to that particular spot in space where the little drama enacts itself if the rom ancewriter is a poet so much the better shakespeare though he drew from no other source than dry old hollingshed has filled the story of the plantagenets as far as he told it with life and energy  calling to his aid the fluellens the bardolphs and the falstaffs he made the reigns of our plantagenets something more than landmarks of english history if we had one sterling writer of national romances with genius enough to raise him above the level track of history and yet no coiner of mere fancy with an alloy of fact we should perhaps be greater as a nation in proportion as we saw in the light of today the greatness and littleness of the past mrs elliot does not write historical romance in this way she occupies an intermediate place between the romancer and the historian she presents history in what margaret of newcastle would have called a  romancical dress her method lacks the continuity and completeness of dumas but it allows of greater accuracy and a closer study of character useless details are avoided the material is scanty and at times almost crude  but irrelevant matters are suppressed and those on which must hinge our conceptions of the mans character are thrust sedulously to the front it must be confessed that to interest the reader on such a plan is an arduous attempt it would have been easy to fill in the story with a few legitimate and even historical incidents but mrs elliot has it seems feared to mar the general effect by redundancy  she has avoided the full narrative style of miss freer for instance and elaborated instead a series of animated scenes which in word gesture dress and attitude are intended to be the counterpart of history that mrs elliott has failed sometimes to present in due relief the historical personages who serve as subjects for her nice pen is not to be wondered at that she has succeeded so well as she has is a matter of congratulation one danger we may safely say she has entirely escaped her chapters though often short and fuller of matter than of words are never tediously epigrammatic though it is impossible in this style of work that the artist should be lost in the picture you are not called away too often to admire her artistic qualities the first eight chapters of old court life in france are devoted to francis i his two queens first claude and then elinor of spain one blameless layfigure succeeding another appear the necessary appanages of a court diane de poitier and anne duchesse detampes are the true queens of the hour mistresses not only of the king but in some small degree of the destinies of france the dynasty of mistresses is however scarcely inaugurated in the time of francis the first marguerite de valois and constable bourbon complete the picture in this first essay however mrs elliot is by no means at her best the second group fuller of dramatic incidents offers greater facilities for success catherine de medici the mother of three worthless kings the organiser of the squadron of court beauties the inventor of the sidesaddle forms the central figure from the time fatherinlaw francis  romped with her the entire evening after her arrival to the day when half a century later she lay on her deathbed while the due de guise was murdered overhead this was that due de guise whom the second marguerite de valois would have married but that her mothers ruthless will gave her to the bearnois henry of navarre most of those men whose fortunes and destinies were mingled with catherines during her halfcentury of power and in whom dumas found a neverending source of mystery and intrigue cross mrs elliots stage she has treated them and everything that concerns catherine with much dramatic power and we are inclined to think that this series contains the best written of her sketches as a specimen of vivid description take this of the familiar party of three mother and two sons watching the st bartholomew massacre from a closet over the gate of the louvre to them enter navarre and conde heretics but royal ones who have escaped partly by favour but as it appears mainly by chance charles had recovered his nerves he now looks on huguenots as game and has been potting them with remarkable precision from the window with hideous mirth he boasts to navarre and conde how many heretics he has brought down with his own hand he counts upon his fingers the names of the huguenot chiefs already slaughtered he yells with fiendish laughter when he describes how coligni whom the night before he had called  father looked when dead  by the light of god it is a royal chase  shrieks

already the scenes which unfold the life of henri iv are scantier than we could wish and the episode of gabrielle destrees occupies rather too many of them undoubtedly the most important figure in her  show of kings henri iv deserves a larger space than mrs elliot has allotted to him quitting henri iv mrs elliot comes to the times of richelieu mazarin and anne of austria annes husband the bilious and melancholy louis xih surnamed  the just is summoned to live again his miserable unkingly career in her pages and we then drop suddenly upon louis xiv inaugurating his reign with the ruin of la valliere we cannot however attempt to follow le grand monarque whose court life occupies the latter half of mrs elliots second volume the sketches grow more voluminous towards the close  the last of them is called  the end and from it we make the following quotation  then the dying monarch turned his face towards madame de maintenon who was seated within the ruelle of the bed 41 madame he said in a low voice  i regret no one but you i have not made you happy his voice hitherto firm now faltered but i have one consolation in leaving you he added  we shall soon meet again he tried to look at her but madame de maintenon turned from him with disgust she huddered  what a rendezvous  she muttered half aloud  he cares for no one but himself bolduc the kings apothecary was near and heard her say so that very day she left him while he dozed and drove away to saintcyr on sunday the 1st of september louis died his confessor the jesuit letellier never returned madame de maintenon remained at saintcyr save the cardinal de rohan and the parish priest of versailles all had forsaken him no sooner had  breathed his last than precautions were necessary to guard his body from insult  e are not of the opinion that much is to be learned from the extravagant licence and splendid vices that ruled te court of france mrs elliot has confined her story within courtly bounds and offends no one by the plainness of her speech but after all an intrigue is an intrigue whether the parties to it are kings and duchesses or grooms and servingwomen  and we venture to doubt the ultimate use of such a book as mrs elliot has produced with this reservation we confess to a keen appreciation of the artistic merits ot  ula uourt late in trance hp  oli court life in france this is the fifth edition of a book that has had many readers and many critics it is the kind of book that is especially annoying to scientific students of history who are both jealous and scornful of narratives treated without tootnotes and without much visible aid from documentary evidence unless they are labelled  imaginative literature mere scraps of history in picturesque setting lay figures with historic names affixed and made to play the part which some contemporary gossip has assigned to them are to their mind frivolous and from an educational point of view dangerous the critics are wrong we should never think of going to such books for exact information on every page of this one for instance we feel how the materials have been cooked the scantiest knowledge of history is enough to make us often read characters and motives differently but it does give the popular idea and picture of the personages and events described from a long study of contemporary memoirs from long familiarity with the country the authoress has learned the fitting stage properties has noted the gossip and the anecdotes she has used all her gathered materials not with imaginative power but with the skill and swiftness of the scene painter and scene shifter the result is a nondescript kind of thing neither history nor romance but it is very readable it is a very vivid series of pictures we are given of the princes and lords and ladies of gay old france from francis and marguerite of valois and diane de poitiers down to the last days of the grand monarque when court gaiety died out under the heavy influence of the

  sir george tressady by mrs humphry ward 6s smith and elder some of us critics of mrs humphry ward have the air of being impossible to please we scouted  robert elsmere  and marcella  for being sugarcoated pamphlets and when she struck out on a quite new path in bessie cotterell in which there was no pamphlet we said that she was attempting work that did not become her now she returns to the earlier model her new story being in fact a sequel to is marcella well at least we cannot ask her to go back to the bessie cotterell  type for that in her hands failed for want of artistic sincerity and her reversion to the kind of thing that first brought her fame means that she has tendencies likings aptitudes that she cannot be criticised out of we ought to be more reasonable now and we are but perhaps the merits of sir george tressady  have something to do with it it is the story of a rather likeable rather colourless man of brains and nar row sympathies who spoilt his political career because marcella exerted such an influence over him that he voted against his party and even his convictions marcella was a goddess to him and he had married a little thin natured shallow vixen of a wife he behaves with great propriety so does marcella so does marcellas husband they all do except lady tressady but propriety does not keep off tragedy and what with his amusingly reckless and frivolous old mother his embittered wife his poverty the strikes among his workmen his shattered parliamentary career and his hopeless adoration of marcella when a hard and heroic death comes to him it is welcome the parliamentary incidents do not strike us as probable marcella in her mellower years is more distasteful than ever wvith her fawning amiability her air of making eyes at all the world including her husband her child and the eastend seamstresses she is a most unpleasing personalitywith something of the chadband in her for all her indiscretions but the book though a dull book is the work of a woman of intellect and of unusually strong sympathies the portraits here are subtler and more living than in her earlier works especially the disagreeable ones like the two lady tressadys and the scenes in the eastend are stamped with sincerity if there was but a little spark of fire anywhere  here is not the temper nor the material out of which great novels can come but in fiction at least we have no abler presentment of the selfconscious earnestness of the time  sir george tressady mrs wards new novel by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co there can be no question that mrs ward is a puzzle to the conscientious critic this has partly resulted from the history of her career as a novelist if we leave miss bretherton out of the reckoning we may say that she seemed to bo sprung upon the reading world with an exaggerated form of that sort of success which somebody has called a sue ces gladstonea rather dangerous preeminence in which if she has a rival it is as his advertisements remind us mr hall caine schoolgirls at once spoke of her with awe and many persons of influence people interested in religious and philanthropic developments whose literary judgement was not necessarily above the level of the schoolgirls on the other hand a section of the illuminati chiefly because she dealt with these religious and social matters legitimate subjects if any were for dramatic treatmentat once set her down for a prig and a pedant and would have no more to do with her all this tends to the confusion of the moderate and modest critic has he to do with a sort of cleansed and refined zola he asks himself or only a more philosophical edna lyall it must make the application of the heavendescended maxim not easy to the distinguished author herself in the present case the critic might well get rid of his difficulties by indiscriminate praise of mrs wards  sir george tressady were such a course fair to any one concerned there is so much that is good throughout and the latter part especially is so fine and moving that faultfinding is disarmed most of the qualities which distinguished  marcella  far above the run of its contemporaries are present again here we have nothing so fully understood and so finely handled as the village life in the previous volumenothing so poetical as the description of hurds poaching or so affecting as the night of hurds execution spent by marcella in the cottage with his wife but the glimpses we get here of the labouring classes their ways and thoughts whether in eastend london or in the mining village in the midlands we should have supposed either north staffordshire or derbyshire from the peoples talk had not mrs ward while giving the characteristic e for a piece  or pleace for placeomitted altogether the equally characteristic ii for e a  for he are well realized and now and then are startlingly effective the english is always choice and in one passage at least the description of sir george tressady awaking in his library after a great quarrel with his wife it reaches a high level the morning air blew upon him and he drew it in with delight how blessed was the sun and the silence of the streets and the dappled sky there to the east beyond the square  after those long hours of mental tension in the crowd and heat of the house of commons what joy what physical relief he caught eagerly at the sensation of bodily pleasure driving away his cares letting the morning freshness recall to him a hundred memoriesthe memories of a traveller who has seen much and loved nature more than man blue surfaces of rippling sea cool steeps among the mountains streams brawling over their stones a thousand combinations of grass and trees and sunand like heralds before the presence these various images flitted passed drew to one side while memory in trembling revealed at last the best she hadan english river flowing through june meadows under a heaven of flame a woman with a child the scents of grass and hawthorn the plashing of water the story of the novel is that of a young man returned after some years of travel and study in our indian and colonial empire full of the revived imperialist if everybody had his due they might fairly be described as the kiplingesque ideas which are such a marked feature in contemporary politics mrs ward is always well up to date in her appreciation of  movements young sir george tressady enters parliament in this spirit and attaches himself to a fourth party led by a certain lord fontenoy whose prototype is not far to seek though it must be said that he only slightly resembles this deceased statesmanwhich is bitterly opposed to the conservative government of the day a rather socialistic body among whom the leading figure is our former friend aldous raeburn now lord maxwell of course therefore mar i celia comes upon the scene in fact she 1 occupies it and is almost as much the heroine of this book as she was of the one  which bears her name at first tressady  is strongly opposed to marcellas way of looking at things and prejudiced against her personally almost at the beginning of the book he marries a certain letty  sewell representative of all that is narrow i minded and vulgar in a privileged class j little as george and his wife have in i common in their natures their views are at 1 the outset the same so far as letty can be said to have any views now comes the change an accidental meeting at a country house leads to a growing friendship between tressady and marcella on her side it never gets beyond the pity of seeing a naturally fine intellect and character cramped and pledged to the wrong cause with him it grows into a passion of devotion of which his wife has good cause to be jealous in this way we have a double motive running through the story  mrs ward almost always has two parallel threadsthe motive of tressadys conversion or halfconversion from the old tory doctrine  power to the capable and strong to a fuller recognition of the hardships and the claims of manual labour and therewith that of his personal conversion to swell the ranks of marcellas devotees it ends in tressadys throwing over his party at a critical division and retiring from politics it also ends in his confessing in a moment of abandonment his romantic love to marcella and as at the same moment letty has gone the length of writing to lord maxwell this modern madame roland is suddenly brought face to face with the fact that she has unwittingly carried disaster into another mans married life very beautifully she humbles herself before the vulgarminded letty tressady and in a great degree repairs the mischief that has been done but sir george is spared the  cursed spite  of being obliged to struggle for ever with the disjointedness of his world he takes part in a rescue down one of his mines and is killed by the falling in of the roof much of all this history is finely conceived and very moving it makes for edification as mrs wards novels always do a great deal of the machinery of the talethe side characters the scenes and dialogues  is admirably contrived and obviously at the expense of great pains and it is an unpleasant task to have to point to the serious drawbacks in the book as a whole what in reality makes mrs ward such a puzzle is that her work is so strangely made up of good and bad the greatest failure in the present case is in the character of marcella marcella boyce seemed a fenuine creation marcella maxwell has egenerated into a schoolgirls heroine a bundle of perfections neither more nor less she is precisely the personage who ought to have been as she was wanting only two steps in the peerage given in marriage to a firstclass earl who kept his carriage of course one will be called a cynic for this assertion but if there be any flaw except of the litterofroseleavesanddinofnightingales order which prevents marcella maxwell being put down as a perfect beauty a perfect wife a perfect mother a perfect philanthropist ana a perfect great lady we do not know where it is to be discovered this is more than a grave it is in a certain sense a fatal error in spite of ben jonson it is precisely the growing like a tree growing invisibly in the thoughts of an author or visibly in his or her writings that makes a character of fiction better or worsethat distinguishes in fact between the created and the manufactured personage of a tale and allows you as no other test does to draw the line between the bestemployed talent and genius think of balzacs people or of thackerays of the grandeur et decadence either of cesar birotteau or of colonel newcome think of ethel or clive of dobbin or hawdon crawley of beatrix esmond baroness bernsteiu this reappearance of marcella therefore is terribly enlightening we frankly confess that the old marcella seemed to us when first we made her acquaintance a complete creation a vital being now looking back and asking ourselves of what she has been stripped to turn her into the superhuman and therefore nonhuman lady maxwell we do not find very much  plenty of opinions but of character not an abundance it is rather we take it as a result than as a cause of this lack of the winged gift of the true creator that mrs ward is able to introduce so much we will not say of teaching but of illustration into her books if her people were more alive they would take the bit between their teeth and refuse to do the things they were wanted to do to illustrate some phase of national tendency or some preconceived theory of the way character developes one might in addition cite a hundred small but speaking instances to prove that our author never forgets her audienceas for example where in the scene of sir georges death she takes care to mention that his message was delivered to letty that passage alone would show that she had not lost herself in her art indeed this whole final scene moving though it is has the air of something written up as if the author had encountered elsewhere a scene conceived on the same lines and said to herself  i can do that too  sir george flvssady by mrs humphry ward smith elder  co in sir george tressady mrs humphry ward has seen fit to test the sincerity of our admiration for the central character of one of her former works by introducing marcella as the dca ex mach ina of her present novel charming though she was on though occasion of our first acquaintance a doubt is born as to whether her reappearance has added anything to our store of pleasant memoriesthe question of sequel in fiction being one not often attended by success several factors combining to render the result as a ride experimental one important reason doubtless is the proverbial fickleness of readers themselves while another may possibly lie in the writers own attitude towards even the most wellconceived and carefully developed personage of the imagination in though interval of presentation a marked change may have taken place in his own interest therein all that was freshest and best having furnished the impulse to the first effort marcella called to do duty again does in a measure redeem our expectation even at times exciting some of the old witchery yet the spark which woke her to life in the story of her youth seems lacking in this record of marcella married and marcella turned politician we view her now from an outside standpoint which admits of coldest criticism she is no longer a wayward noble stumbling lovable girl but is summarised heartlessly and with some emphasis as a political intriguante implying the unscrupulous coquette she may be as earnest as intense as beautiful as loving towards poor humanity as faithfully devoted to her husbands interests as ardent a parliamentarian as the old marcella would have been when developed by her new surroundings but the germ is wanting and only a wellarticulated marionette animated by overmuch pulling remains that sir george tressadys parliamentary upsetting to say nothing of his domestic undoing should indirectly hinge upon this character in whom we have least belief would indicate a fallingoff in the authors further development of marcella it were ungracious to dwell further upon this point when a debt of gratitude remains yet unacknowledged mrs ward having introduced many new and several wellobserved characters in whom thc first interest of the general leader will centre letty especially sir georges wife is brilliantly portrayed showing both skill and delicate insight in though handling whatever her phases and there are many she carnes conviction which is though best perhaps that can be said of any of those who speak and move in the pages of fiction her small ambitions and petty triumphs her little prettinesses the utter inability of her poor soul to rise above the height of her husbands shoestrings her lack of sympathy with all outside the most limited of social belongingsall appear in such light as to prove her reality she embodies the dainty pretty heartless society creature whom everyone knows so well and who is so often illpaired with a sir george of ones acquaintance letty is certainly alive more the pity for wherever she is one may be sure she is bruising the heart of some earnest man sir george himself is interesting wc like him so well that we wish ho had never befooled himself even for the brief moment of his infatuation with marcella every scene with his wifeand those with bin vain prodigal deceitful dying motherbear the stamp of truth thora are no false lines here no rubbing out no substitution no blur all is direct sufficient needful from beginning to end mis ward hits shown her knowledge of the man and grasp of his position the downfall of his ambitions his hampered domestic life with it  fretting money anxieties nnd the undcrcunent of real unhappiness ring true wo realise the soreness of his heart and dwell with him in sympathy of the minor characters

  fiction the wooings of jesebel pettyfer by haldane i a  i macfall simpkin marshall and tso os t hose who did not read this story of the tropics when it appeared fifteen years ago should hasten to do so now that it is republishedthat is if they feel able to take an interest in the doings of characters who nearly all are  coloured the hero of the book jehu dyle is a fascinating rogue and there is a great deal more about him than about the heroine jezebel pettyfer indeed at times we are apt to forget her existence dyle takes charge of author and reader and his tremendous cheek his repartee his lively sense of his own importance pervade the whole the scene of the eventsbarbados and jamaicagives mr macfall a good opportunity for his powers of description and some of these descriptive passages vivid and full of colour will be the most pleasing parts of the book to many readers the chapters dealing with  the nuptials of elias chudgrew  are excellent and form a little interlude of comedy which few will be able to resist jezebel pettyfer the dark and easygoing beauty somehow fails to impress us though she is real enough and it is quite evident that somewhere her prototype must have

of which render the volume unsuitable for young persons now and then the writer shows some good powers of description but the interest of the volume is undoubtedly connected with the dialogue and the knowledge of character which he possesses in places the author achieves no small share of success and he has unquestionably written a clever volume to some it will appear as a curiosity of literature

somewhat evanesced  the wooings of jezebel pettyfer by haldatic mactall 6is simpkin marshall mr haldane nlacfall is known as an art critic as the author of several brilliant books on art and letters and ot two novels the wooings of jezebel pettyfer and  the masterfolk and if these two last are not the most remarkable of his works they are none the less among the most remarkable novels of recent years this new and carefully revised reissue of his first book reminds one of the deservedlyiine things that were said of it on its first appearance and elf the instant success it achieved with the reading public of a decade or miore ago it is a wonderfully intimate and realistic tale of the uest indies written from the personal acquaintance mr mlacfall made with the place and its people when he held a commission in a wvest indian regimneutand its vzivid minutely faithful pictures of negro character alone make it a book of more than common merit but beyond this it unfolds an excellent story of the life of one negro in particular in all his relations with the men and women of his own colour and of the dominant white race and it works out a great ethical problem fearlessly with humour and pathos and mordant irony mr m1acfalls creed is that though celibacy is nearly as harmful to the race as promiscuity  the main who lives chastely and faithful to his mate is of the elect and the nation that holds his like holds the dominion over the wvorld he enforces this view ably cunningly with a ripe narrative skill and understanding of humanity his psychological study of an average west indian negro is clever and subtle and the powerful story he weaves about him revealing the superstitions the good nature the broad humour and nonmioral character of his kind touched with gayest lighlts and sombre shadows is everywhere alive with interest we wvelcome this new edition of an original and striking book and look to see a large access to the number of its readers  the wooings2of jezebel pettyfer by haldane macfall bf richards from the first paragraph this novel must arrest the attention of sulc as care for good writing in their fiction and are sensi tive to power and truth in the description of the external world it is altogether an exceptional book original interesting and mostly repulsive the repulsion arises from the fact that we are not quite convinced of the accuracy of mr mcfalls presentation of human nature among barbados negroes now and again we have a suspicion that the observation is coloured by the prejudgments of a fix de sick mind that some characters and some situations are tortured to produce a kind of morbid humour and to shake our sentimental ignorance of the negro by any means we may be quite wrong the proper sequel to such a novel is an unimaginative study of the coloured people of the west indies and we hope it may be forthcoming mr mcfalls fantastic pictures present them not as the simple children we have hitherto thought them but as subtle sophisticated clever rascals very amusing and hopelessly sometimes unpleasantly immoral there is nothing commonplace about his book and in it there is nothing by itself really dull but he piles up evidence and incidents and talk in an endless fashion so that his greatest admirers must perforce skip many pages as there is no particnlar plan they will not therefore lose much of the general effect of this puzzling clever but too lengthy book whose author proves himself to be at once humourist sensationmonger and philosopher,northamerica_contra
  lyra nicotiana the pipe and the muse edited by w g hutchinson  canterbury poets  series walter scott although though stimulus and friend of many a poet tobacco has we may say at starting inspired little good verse in praise of itself these lyrics of pipe and cigar snuff and cigarette are for the most part very trifling affairs good smokers do not talk about tobacco much less rhyme a pipe is poem enough there are of course exceptions such as mr lowell and mr henley and mr leland but in the main it is the enthusiastic but inexperienced young who hymn the weed tobacco makes for reticence for contemplation tobacco is an oriental grave and sedentary silent and content this little book is a piece of western restlessness and frivolity the best thing in it is undoubtedly mr henleys rondeau

mutual admiration over a pipe heard in this hours delicious divagation how soft the song the epigram how terse with what a genius for administration we rearrange the rambling universe and map the course of mans regeneration over a pipe both these poems by the way are more than twenty years old mr henley is represented in all by eight pieces seven of which specifically belaud the pipe a meerschaum for preference it is therefore a little odd to find him figuring in the frontispiece with a cigarette between his fingers mr lowell also praised the meerschaum   the pipe came safe and welcome too as anything must be from you  a meerschaum pure twould float as light as she the girls call amphitrite mixture divine of foam and clay from both it stole the best away its foam is such as

pipes an fancy pipesthings jes made to sell but any pipe that kin be bought for marbles chalk or pelf aint ekal to th haver of th pipe you make yourself the prospect of having to make ones own pipe is too alarming cigars cheroots and cigarettes come in for celebration but in the main the book is the book of though pipe as to brands of tobacco the poets are not explicit mr t b aldrich like the late james payn explains that he is addicted to latakia  but the question is left vague by his brother bards we cannot consider that mr hutchinson has done his work particularly well the number of pieces with no signature to thom or any indication of origin is much too large and considering how easy it is to trace the authorship of verses that appear in reputable newspapers it is a sign of carelessness on mr hutchinsons part that he appends to certain selections only  the globe  the st jamess gazette and so i on though editors of these journals would 1 have f urnished though names of their con1 tributors with pleasure again mr hutchinsons notes are very scant in the other anthologies included in the canterbury poets particularly in the case of the sonnets of the century collected by mr william sharp the general editor of the series the notes have been full and interesting but mr hutchinson has only thirteen to a volume of over two hundred and fifty pages there are cases where notes are positively needed or deserved there is a piece of blank verso by mr leland for example inscribed  to w g h ie mr w g hutchinson which we imagine was written especially for this volume  but

  the sport of the gods by esther miller i innes  co where a man is liable to be indicted for murder and where the only witness who can condemn him or save him by silence is a woman one of two things can happen she can be called as a witness to give her evidence or if there is no disability or impediment she can marry the accused in a criminal case a wifes testimony is not admissible against her husband on this question turns the story entitled  the sport of the gods it is long before the heroine knows that her husband is innocent and until then they live apart at length it is found that there was another and a better witness and the real murderer is revealed such is the story and as a melodramatic plot it is very well told the reader will regret that the literary skill of the author which is small is not equal to her capacity for framing a plot nevertheless the novel is exciting and preserves its interest to the end we imagine that a lawyer who reads the first few chapters will ask why the leading personages including a practising solicitor are not indicted for conspiracy by statute as well as at common law but such an occurrence would unquestionably spoil an otherwise excellent story,northamerica_contra

  the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin

suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about

gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a

been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old

  the fortunes of glencore by charles lever 3 vols chapman  hall between this novel and its predecessors from the same pen there is a difference as wide as that between a feudal tournament and a tipperary row formerly mr lever was a lord of romantic misrule his harry lorrequer was the kinsman of his irish dragoon and both were the heroes of fun folly and adventure the lever literature in truth was sprightly and rollickingthe action ofthe several stories rattled on amid uproar and excitementthe actors and the audience laughed together there was a brogue even in the style of the narrator the fortunes of glencore is of another stamp it is a serious novel built upon a plan more conventional than that adopted by mr lever in any of his former works from a prefatory notice we quote the authors account of his literary temptations  if i have never disguised from myself the grounds of any humble success i have attained to as a writer of fictionif i have always had before me the fact that to movement and action the stir of incident and a certain lightheartedness and gaiety of temperament more easy to impart to others than to repress in oneself i have owed much if not all of whatever popularity i have enjoyed i have yet felt or fancied that i felt that it would be in the delineation of very different scenes and the portraiture of very different emotions that i should reap what i would reckon as a real success this conviction or impression if you will has become stronger with years and with the knowledge of life  years have imparted and time has but confirmed me in the notion that any skill i possess lies in the detection of character and the unravelment of that tangled skein which makes up human motives he presents glencore not as a proof but as a test of his capacity for drawing social portraits his story he admits may not be particularly interesting as a narrative but it is an attempt at close delineation of character manners and modes of thought as influenced by the civilization of our age in great britain and in italy for although glencore is the name of an irish castle and many of the personages introduced are english a large proportion of the ground surveyed is italian while much of the groupsketching belongs to the danimonde of florence glencore is the name of an ancient castle on the killeries an inlet of the sea in the west of ireland it appertains to a noble family of whom the sixth viscount is the central figure of the story although his son divides the sympathies of the reader when the tale opens lord glencore after a prolonged absence has returned to his ancestral habitation whereisolated penurious and melancholyhe devotes himself to the education of his only son in course of time two old and confidential friends arrive at the castle they find its inmate alternating between delirious fever and a habit of morbid soliloquy the boy is scarcely less eccentric than his lather gradually the secret glimmers out from the reserve and mystery of glencore the viscount all novel readers will have suspected ithas been deserted by his wife mr lever however has managed to develop a novelty in  connexion with this incident glencore unfolds to his confidential associate sir horace upton a plan of revenge upon the lost and faithless lady sir horace alone could offer testimony to the marriage  all the documents are at glencore castlethe viscount destroys these documents sacrifices his son and proclaims that clarissa isabella daughter of sir guy clifford and commonly called lady glencore was never married but is still clarissa isabella clifford ami mother not of a seventh viscount but of a social outcast this shaft of vengeance launched from the killeries reaches florence where the separated wife  la comtesse de glencore reigns queen of beauty and fashion thus stigmatized she disappears glcncores son disappears also the story then winds through numerous intricacies to the end which in fairness tu mr lever we will only vaguely indicate in the last chapter billy traynor the most original character in the novel meditates alone at the ancient castle  the battlements have fallenthe atlantic winds blow noisily through the fractured walls the old man reads the family chronicles  he started up from his reverie and taking his stick issued from the room the mist was beginning to rise and he took his way towards the shore of the lough through the wet and tangled grass it was a long and toilsome walk for one so old as he was hut he went manfully onward and at last reached the little jetty where the boats from the mainland were wont to put in all was cheerless and leadenhued over the wide waste of water a surging swell swept heavily along but not a wiil was to be seen far across the lough he could descry the harbour of leenane where the boats were at anchor and see the lazy smoke as it slowly rose in the thick atmosphere seated on a stone at the waters edge billy watched long ami patiently his eyes turning at times towards the bleak mountain road which for miles was risible at last with a weary sigh he arose and muttering he wont come today turned back again to his lonely home to this hour he lives and waits the coming of glencore racterpainting as mr lever explains in the preface has been his aim throughout these volumes we think his success special though partial billy traynor in spite of occasional exaggerations is a lifelike figure with a lifelike voice the elder glencore typifies in his diseased hate and weary weakness the fortunes of his declining family his son is but a shadow and melts out of view  sir horace upton is a political portrait the original of which perhaps might be discovered without trouble of course mr lever had the princess lieven in his eye when he studied for his lady diplomatist col harcourt full length hangs at the light end of the gallery glencore occupies the gloom there is careful drawing in all these portraits sometimes the features are unreasonably prominent frequently the tintings are those of the toilettetable not of nature mr lever we think is rough in his use of the dissectingknife to the machinery of the story objections more serious may be taken it fe worked partly by means of correspondence occasionally by newspaper paragraphs and in one instance by a leading article there is too much stilllife  though reader continually regrets being led away from the healthy irish landscapes and peasant circles around glencore following the fortunes of the miserable viscount we arrive at a passage which is a fair sample of mr levers dialogue and romance new style and how is the dear duke asked upton sharplyjust as you saw him at the court of louis the eighteenth he swaggers a little more as he gets more feeble about the legs and he shows his teeth when he laughs more decidedly since his last journey to paris devilish clever fellows these modern dentists are he wants to marry i suppose youve heard it not a word of it who is the happy fairthe nina as they call her now she waa one of the della torres who married or didnt marry glencore dont you remember him he was colonel of the eleventh and a devil of a martinet he was i rememler him said upton dryly well he ran off with one of those girls and some say they were married at capri as if it signified what happened ut capri she was a deuced goodlooking girl at the time  a coquette you knowand gleucore was one of those stiff english fellows that think every man is making up to his wife he drank besides no pardon me there you are mistaken i knew him intimately glencore wat as temperate as myself i have it from lowther who used to take him home at night he said glencore never went to bed sober at all events she hated him and detested his miserly habitoanother mistake my dear major glencore was never what is called a rich man but he was always a generous one i suppose youll not deny that he used to thrash her  ay and with a horsewhip too come come scaresby this is really too coarse for mere jestingjest by jove  it was very bitter earnest she told brignolles all about it im not sure she didnt show him the markstake my word for it scaresby said upton dropping his voice to a low but measured tone  this is a base calumny and the duke of brignoues no moro circulated such a story than i did he is a man of honour and utterly incapable of it i can only repeat that i believe it to be perfectly true  said scaresby calmly  nobody here ever doubted the story i cannot say what measure of charity accompanies your zeal for truth in this amiable society scaresby but i can repeat my assertion that thia must be a falsehood  you will find it very hard nevertheless to bring any one over to your opinion retorted the unappeasable major he was a fellow everybody hated proud and supercilious to all and treated his wifes relationswho were of far better blood than himselfas though they were canaille i a loud crash as if of something heavy having fallen here interrupted their colloquy and upton sprang from his seat and hastened into the adjoining room close beside the doorso close that he almost fell over it in entering  lay the figure of lord glencore in his efforts to reach the door he had fainted and there he laya cold clammy sweat covering his livid features and his bloodless bps slightly parted the fortunes of glencore we suspect is mr

  the ms in a red box lane the author of this romance has had the good fortune to hit upon a period in history which has not been hackneyed by general use we remember no other novel in which the draining of the fens by dutchmen under charles i is the mainspring of the plot it is well known that this improvement roused the fierce hostility of the people of the fens and it is that hostility which the author employs in his stirring narrative thus the tale has this to the good that it has a natural colour particular to it and is in consequence of somewhat a different shape from the multitude of romances technically termed  historical unhappily the characterization has little to distinguish it from the ruck of such performances the hero frank vavasour is the usual brave and reckless young fellow in love with a fair maiden as is habitual with such tales the hero is so headstrong as to run into every danger that a man with a grain of common sense would have avoided as is also usual he tells his own tale very modestly of course and sings the praises of his ladylove not so modestlyas is natural and the two chief villains are exactly what we looked forthe one dutch and the other an english nobleman they are blackened to a hair and could not be whitewashed by the most ingenious perverter of history but of a truth they glory in their shame and are calculated to fill unsophisticated minds with the most passionate feelings of revenge for the colours are all primitive and the drawing is with crayons not that that matters in this style of book it is sufficient that there should be plenty of incident which there is and that the narrative should amble briskly which it does the writing too is of quite a spirited order so that there is little wanting to make a good book of adventure rather above the average and possibly the earnest of better work by its anonymous author  the ms in a red box lane 6s tue mystery of the ms of this story has been so much exploited that we need not refer to it further here save to pay that the book itself comes rather as an anticlimax for though it is a pleasant and reasonably interesting book it is no better than dozens of volumes which have appeared during say the past three years the author has a faculty for narrative sufficient invention and enough knowledge of his period to carry the thing through  in a word he is a good mechanic but there is no characterisation in the story the hero is the very type of the conventional hero and the three villains are very types of the conventional villain the hero sails triumphantly through all dangers to happiness and the lady and the villains come by their deserts there are a good many minor characters but they come in merely as accessories indeed the experienced reader can tell at once just why they make their appearance but all this is not to say that the book is not goed of its kind the setting is careful and accurate and the conflict between the folks of axholme and the dutch engineer vermuijden who had charles the firsts authority to drain and embank the isle is vigorously described the manner of the book smacks rather of wardour street purely modern phrasing and almost slang clash unpleasantly with an artificial archaism but here again the author merely sins with most of those secondclass writers of romance with whom at present he must be classed yet the story has promise and a kind of ease and briskness which experience may turn to good account and at least the book is wholesome and manly and cleanblooded  the ms in a red box 6s lane

  phases of an inferior planet fiction by ellen glasgow heinemann 6s tnis is a new york story of bohemian art life the  chief fault is that the author has so passionately concentrated herself on the two leading characters that the minor  figures are carelessly imagined and drawn without force or originality but it will be read for its extraordinary  and pitiless analysis of a very woman of the time the effect achieved is one of unrelieved misery for ourselves we say franklyand it is a tribute in a way to the writers powerthat we regret having opened it so painful was the depression it left behind the life of everyone is in large measure a struggle against pessimism and melancholy and contains sorrow enough without calling in this ill omened prophet to destroy the last germ of hope for that is the conclusion of the whole matter mariana passes through ali the deep experiences of life and finds nothing but illusion she wins such a love as might be thought to redeem any existence from despair yet it leads but to deeper sorrows motherhood yields no consolation it seemed inexplicable to her that women went on travailing and giving birth that a woman who had once known the agony of maternity should consent to bear a second a third or a fourth child struck her as ridiculous she closed her eyes and laughed the experienced novelreader needs no telling that a story written in this temper ends in death but how that gloomy consummation is reached we leave the explorer to discover the hero is left in despairhe is a  father but an atheist he has uncorked a bottle of poison when a knock comes to the door he replaced the stopper still holding the phial in his hand for a moment the heavy silence hung oppressively and then he answered  what is it   his voice sounded lifeless like that of one awakening from heavy sleep or a trance you are there come quickly the men at the beasley rolling mills have gone on strike a policeman was shot and several of the strikers wounded you are wanted to speak to them  to speak to them p   i have a cab you may prevent bloodshed come father algarcife returned the phial to its drawer withdrew the key from the lock and rose he opened the door and faced the messenger his words came thickly there is no time to lose he said lam ready with this message and the moral underlying it the book  abruptly ends it is not to be disputed that ellen glasgow has obtained a brilliant success if her aim was to impress the miserable doctrine that life is not worth living were such a mournful philosophy well founded its dissemination could only end in discouragement and decay but her insight is not equal to her powers of observation the best of her work is largely made up of externals and the reader cannot help feeling at the salient points in the career of her hero and heroine that there must have been in their lives much more than comes within her ken every thinker has moments of despair but none has attained real greatness who has cast the shadow of these over all life  we bid you to hope was the final message of the greatest writer of this century and one cannot help thinking that the latterday lady novelist would not be so gloomy and pessimistic if she would ponder the grounds on which that message was based at all events of all the  isms  in the categoryrealism and sensationalism includewe are inclined to think this  ism  of blank misery by far the most pernicious  phases of an inferior planet by ellen glasgow heinemann mariana the heroine of the story is elusive and absorbent and has many strange qualities of which endurance is not one for she parts with her husband mainly on the ground that her neighbours devour fried cabbage she has harmonious lines in spite of her irregular nose and her long chin so an artist made a poster of her upon their first acquaintance her profession was singing which she came to new york to prosecute in the curious society of the gotham house where mr paul the pessimist mr nevins the artist and others of her admirers dwell together she meets her literary lover algarcife once in love he finds many feelings revived which have been subdued so long that their expression is very difficult their married life is disastrously broken by poverty and the death of the child and mariana leaves her husband to despair which somehow ends in the agnostic becoming a ritualist priest the transition is accounted for by the necessity of working on philanthropic lines for works sake  but it is as little convincing as marianas neurotic incompetence or the late reconciliation there is merit in the story and some of the minor characters are deftly handled but it is about three times too long  phases of an inferior planet by ellen glasgow 6s ttrilnemann this is one of the exasperatingly clever exasperatingly incapable books which are produced so frequently today there is no grip of life in it and there is intellect in abundance the writer has a sense of style and she descends to bunkum she has shrewdness and she lets her characters take her in she has humour but it is of a truant fickle quality the story told baldly is rather sordid a luxuryloving girl who mistakes herself for a genius marries a very poor man of science privations make her miserable and him too for her sake so she leaves him and her art she is a singergives her opportunities for becoming very rich meanwhile her husband who is and continues to be a freethinker gives up science and becomes a highly successful ritualist priest do not ask us why it seems so natural to miss glasgow that she does not think it worth while to explain after many years the erring wife returns and says she has never loved but him with some decency he repulses her at first then succumbs to her fascinations and only her death saves his cutting his pastorship and running off with her to the sunny south the story is aimless nonsense but in the detail there is a surprising amount of ability the writer has a real power of sketching a character in a word or two as here for example wiss ramsey belonged to that numerous army of women who fulfil life as they fulfil an appointment at the

  olive lathaon by e l voynich heine i mann wh1atsince we venture to class it with othersshould be said of books like  olive latham  they show perhaps many strong and even original points of detail but their refusal to emerge as organised wholes seems to throw them back into the limbo of the things that should be but somehow are not alive the things that will not stand on their feet so to speak this is we know not the received opinion concerning work by this author her jack raymond however and the gadfly do not alter the conviction we have rightly or wrongly formed this novel bears on the horrible old story of russias misgovernment official criminality and particularly on the chartered suppression of the genius and even the lives of her children the question seems not so much if the picture be true or unnecessarily unpleasant but if the author has put new life and significance into the scenes where her revolutionaries and their persecutors figure knowledge of the movements towards a freer intellectual and political life there is but this presentation of it in the concrete is crude even perhaps a little brutal and not to the present reviewer truly powerful and soulstirring readers of olive latham may indeed supand that plentifullyon horrors butand here is the weaknesswithout being intensely horrified or moved to deepest pity and indignation nothing in the way of situation or circumstance that should affect readers to such emotions has been left out even restraint and the effect by suggestion rather than description are not to her unknown methods but the unfortunate fact is that in spite of its grim subject and the grimmer revelations it produces this book has an air of being manufactured rather than inevitable surely the begin ning and the end of

  chinese novels translated from the originals to which are added pro  verbs and moral maxiws collected from their classical books and other sources the ivhofc prefaced by observations on the language and lite j rature of china rfo by john francis davis frs 8vo pp 250 london 1822 until the embassy of lord macartney to china an imperfect translation of a novel was the only specimen of chinese literature for which we had to thank our countrymen and we were in the utmost ignorance respecting a people with whom our commercial dealings were immense that embassy howml  ever cleared away much of the obscu mi rity which involved the subject not merely through the personal observations of those who composed it but also by its more remote tendency to awaken a general curiosityandadesireto know something concerning so singular a people since that time chinese literature has received considerable attention the penal code of china has been translated other illustrations of chinese manners and chinese literature have been made known to us by the labours of sir george staunton and dr morrison and now mr davis by his translation of a few chinese novels and proverbs has enabled us to become still better acquainted with the subject these novels are prefaced by a brief but interesting notice of the language and literature of china  the chinese says mr davis value themselves not a little on the mere antiquity of their literature and are disposed to look down with great contempt on the learning of all other nations they have some books such as the yeking which are not now intelligible without a verbal comment to natives themselves if that may be applied to a nation which is told of an individual they may be compared to the man who wept in his old age because e could not comprehend the productions of his youth  but if we should be inclined lo laugh at them on this score they may still assume grounds of superiority over us ith as much right at least as he who proudly said to his audience  gentlemen i have forgotten more than you ever knew  a student of chinese should be somewhat acquainted with these books because there are frequent allusions to them in modern writings but to confine himself exclusively to them appears to be a downright loss of time there are many excellent works of a later date which may not only serve as better models of the style of the present day but likewise convey far more information with regard to the present state of the empire and the character of the people and as has been before observed multitudes of amusing dramas and novels from which may be selected much curious matter what we now want is a little practical know ledge of chinese literature instead of speculative dissertations on the nature ofthe language this volume contains three novels entitled  the shadow in the water c the twin sisters and the  three dedicated chambers they are all much too long for our insertion but we shall take the commencement of the second novel  the twin sisters which will afford a good specimen of the general style of these tales  early in the reign of an emperor of the ming dynasty there dwelt in a city of the province of hookwang a merchant named siaoukiang who had the misfortune to live on very indifferent terms with his wife they were for a long while without any family until after a lapse of many years two daughters twins were born to them it is a popular remark that sons generally resemble the father and daughters though motlier but these two sisters contrary to what is usum ally the case did not inherit the features of either of theil parents and they seemed like the children of some other family neither was the difference confined to their persons for their dispositions were quite as dissimilar as the father and mother wore extremely plain and very stupid so on the contrary the daughters were very handsome and particularly clever after ten years of age they began to resemble fair flowers glittering with dew or fragrant herbs agitated by the breeze  and their beauty every day increased until having reached the age of fourteen or fifteen no one could behold them without emotion not only were the young men in love with them but even those ofa more advanced age when they beheld  aaa confessed the power of their chara 4 their dispositions were extremely docile but notwithstanding this they lia i loamed but little and the xvhole extent of their knowledge xvas confined to figures as to though use of the needle and other female accomplishments they needed but little instruction in order to acquire them their dress and ornaments were from their station in life coarse and ordinary but vet when these txvo girls were compared xvith the daughters of more wealthy   their father beni a mcichautd and dignified persons it was allowed by all that they need not change their homely dress and metal ornaments for the silks and jewek of the others  as they were so very handsome and engaging it naturally followed that the young men of fortune and family should seek them  the good man and his dame were more like enemies than husband and wif the former wanted to marry his daughters without the interference ofthe latter and his wife on the other hand wished to obtain two scnsinlaw without the know ledge of her husband with this principle of mutual deceit they each of them secretly engaged with their sepaiate friends  though the father was severe in his own house he was naturally of a kind and friendly disposition  not like his wife whose turbulence led her when provoked to make the neighbourhood ring with her violence people therefore said to themselves that it would be an easier thing to dupe him than her aid that of the two it was better to aid the wife than the husband hence it was that the latter was more successful in her adherents than the former and after a little while for each of her daughters a husband was selected a fortunate day wtas chosen for the marriage and they the bridegrooms were desired to send the wedding presents  but with a view to prevent her husbands disapprobation and rejection of the match he was kept in ignorance of the whole  there were some sensible persons who said that the propriety of a daughters marriage ought to be determined by the father and that if the mother would not consent the matter should be referred to the magistrate who would neversule with an obstinate woman nor put add the husband for the sake of favouring the wife these persons wanted to get somebody to make their proposals to the former hut unfortunately all those whom they asked proved to be as ready to deceive him as they were afraid of his wife and when inmr  vited to act against her they immediately made some pretext for declining they dared not to incur her resentment saying that if they offended the husband they had nothing to do but tt wait irntd he broke out and then reason with him  and if he was violent they might still go and complain to the magistrate but if they offended his wife and her anger was excited it was not fit for them to contend with a woman  and should she abuse and even chastise them they must bear it and could do nothing in return  thus it was that no one would consent to assist those who wished to make proposals to the good man and they were accordingly obligt d to open the subject to him in person isle had been very much nettled at seeing people in the first inst ince go to his wife without coming t consult him and therefore on the present occasion when the marriage of his daughters was proposed to him he echoed ln consent vdth great satisfaction and made not the slightest obj dion  lio suitors told him that every one was afraid of his wife and tiiat for this reason none would act as mediators what therefore was to bo done isle

knowing the bald understanding which existed between though parents ot tiie bride and fearful of offliding cither party hid each caused a pair of ceremonial tickets to be made out one for siaoukiang and the other for his wife thinking it better to be too ceremonious than not enough so when however the tickets xvere examined a little cloner it turned out to the great asionidiment of either party

  the heiress of the season by sir william magnay bart 6s smith elder a faint reflection of the dreyfus affair gives a pungency to a story that would otherwise be rather dull  the pride of life and  the fall of a star  were much more interesting in their setting and their characterisation but then when a young and hopeful politician is wrongfully accused of betraying the details of a secret treaty to berlin and a young and beautiful heiress proves staunch to him in his disgrace human interest ample and strong enough has been provided and a very popular story must be the result beyond this the book seems to be a wail against the heartlessness the worldliness and the treachery of london society the virtues do not walk abroad anywhere in the neighbourhood of hyde park corner  the heiress of the season by sir william magnay bart smith elder  co the author had clearly  got into all his london feelings to use his own quotation from sydney smith when he penned this vivacious and satirical story the plot of the exambassador lord rossie and his wife against charleroy the rising statesman and successful rival of their son in politics and love is almost too atrocious even for such a past master in cynicism as the diplomat or such an accomplished sapphira as his worthy helpmeet  no one could keep the commandments one at a time like the exambassadress when it happened to serve her turn  and it is her merit to discharge her poisoned arrows under cover of duty to her neighbour there are many dramatic situations in which the veneer is more or less rubbed off the numerous actors and the dialogue is uniformly fresh and sometimes epigrammatic the book should not diminish the authors reputation,northamerica_contra

more critical attention than it has hitherto received it may not be the highest development of fiction but it is a form of literary artor rather to be cautious there is no reason why it should not be a form of literary art three things are necessary so g h lews has told us to good literaturevision sincerity and esthetic beauty now no one would deny that the sherlock holmes series for example has both vision and sincerity dr conan doyle  realises intensely and his best work is obviously and thoroughly sincere that his outlook is narrow and his characters crudely conventionalised is beside the point for all art is narrow when compared to life and all art must be more or less conventional without convention one could not have form where dr doyle and his imitators fall short is in the quality of aesthetic beauty of which most of them seem to have not the slightest perception it must be said however for mr e w hornung that his book does disclose a certain feeling for beauty his search for the precise epithet is sometimes quite successful and all his stories have a gracefulness of contour not often to be observed in this species of work mr hornung is avowedly an imitator or shall we say a  flatterer  of dr doyle yet he has his originalities his hero a j raffles possesses it is true the sherlock holmes attributes but he uses them for the commission of crimes not for their punishment of course he was not really a criminalonly an amateur though an amateur who could meet and beat most professionals he had a code of honour and stuck to it otherwise he would have been impossible as a hero  we shall have our work cut out was all i said 44 and do you suppose i should be keen on it if we hadnt cried raffles my dear fellow i would rob st pauls cathedral if i could but i could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasnt looking than i could bag the apples out of an old womans basket even that little business laat month was a sordid affair but it was necessary and i think its strategy redeemed it to some extent now theres some credit and more sport in going where they boast theyre on their guard against you the bank of england for example is the ideal crib and so on till all ones notions of right and wrong are turned topeyturvey a j raffles is successful in all his little affairs till the last one when a grim scottish detective who has shadowed him throughout brings him up all standing the amateur escapes with his life from a precarious position and probably mr hornungs intention is that at a future date he shall renew his doubtful activities the book is distinctly a good one it is perhaps inferior to its exemplar in that wealth of corroborative detail which convinces and that ingenuity of weaving which enthrals but on the other hand it has a lightness and brightness which dr doyle never attempted  notes on novels these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the amateur cracksman by e w

a sherlockholmes type of man who however not only detects crimes but also perpetrates them for the sheer fun of the thing a very readable set of stories methuen 6s  the amateur cracksman by e w hor nung methuen  co tins is a highly pleasing story of two young bloods who engage in the agreeable pastime of burglary in order to stave off the bankruptcy staring them in the face one of them as is natural is the mastermind while the other is the weak fool who allows himself to be driven though it must be admitted that he takes very kindly and skilfully to his novel business at first things go fairly smoothly but they make the mistake of getting entangled with some professional burglars and the cunning sleuthhound of the law tracks them down on a german lloyd steamer the different chapters are almost detached stories in themselves and have enough fun and adventure in them to satisfy the most exacting appetite this is certainly a much more amusing book than mr hornungs last volume of

  napoleons lovestory bv anaclaw asi4rqwski translated bv the count de soiions 6s jduckworth and co most english readers associate polikh fiction with the namie of the author of  ouo vadis and there was ample room for introducing to them a powerful specimen of this younger novelists work gasiorowski is described bv his translator as an enilhusiastic admirer  of napoleon whose ardour is baed upon original research that of itself does not make a good hiktorical ronance but one is bound to admit that this long dramatic tale of the polish beautv madame de alewska with her aged jealous conceited beau of a huvband and her unselfish quixotic and fatal passion for napoleon carries the reader to the end with an intvrest that sldom slackens it is a subtle tragic episode the character of the heroine with her disappointed idal i9 handled with insight and vivid sympathy so are most of the minor figuresthev live and move napoleon is less attractive hi roic is senslial and selfish but the general impression left on the mind by a perusal of this fine though by no nmean great romance is distinctly one f trenth and directness in characterisation the tranilation reads fairly well but wvhv are so many spaces in the lines filled up with dots throughout the dialogue and the dtecription they have an ugly telegraphic look  flctlbtf napoleons love story by waclaw gamorowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth 6s we have read every word of this story with the greatest pleasure and interest and count de soissons claim in his brief introduction that gasiorowski though he does not bring into literature any new element is a very able master of the historical romance originated by sir walter scott is entirely justified the title alone seems a mistake napoleon either had no lovestory or he had a good many here we are concerned only with his brief passion or marie walewska a polish lady who was as good as she was beautiful and who belonged to that petite noblesse from which gasiorowski is himself sprung she bore the emperor a son alexandre walewski who afterwards became french ambassador at the court of st james represented france at the funeral of the duke of wellington and achieved a certain literary reputation he was a man with a heart of gold highminded and extraordinarily disinterested and it is evident to judge by this story that he inherited these qualities from his mother marie walewska married at twenty to a wealthy courtier of eighty conceived a romantic admiration for napoleon and the story depicts in the most moving and vivid manner her feelings when she begins to understand the real meaning of the emperors attentions that she yielded to him was a supreme act of selfsacrifice for she is led by the old polish statesman malachowski to believe that she will revive by her influence the fallen glories of her country she has a brother a humble lieutenant who learns of her shame which is at the same time the explanation of his sudden promotion to a colonelcy there is a dramatic scene between them not only does he cast her off but he throws in her face papers which contain damning proof of napoleons treachery to the polish cause to this succeeds a picture of quiet domesticity at schoenbrunn and then madame walewska is called to the deathbed of an old playmate of her childhood an officer named gorayski the emperor is bent on the austrian marriage and so a guilty colour is placed on the wholly innocent visit to gorayski and madame walewska is banished to poland not the least striking part of the book is her life when she returns to her aged husbands castle and the description of his reverential adoration of her baby son whom he always calls imperial highness we have had to pass over much that is admirable notably the scenes in paris the birth of the king of rome and the appearance of poor eleonore augier but we must mention the wonderful picture of polish society when napoleon first appears in warsawthe figures of talleyrand de segur duroc prince borghese davoust and many others mingling with the crowd of greedy courtiers and worldlywise women with whom madame walewskas native innocence and purity are strikingly contrasted yet the central allcompelling figure of the book is napoleon whether present or absent he is the determining force the masterspirit in whom every one is merged  napoleons love story by waclaw gasio rowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth  co m de soissons the translator of this romance of napoleon at warsaw tells us that the author is a napoleonic enthusiast so much may be gathered from the clear and vivid presentment of the fate of the virtuous and patriotic polish lady whose sorrows and betrayal at the hands of her ideal seem to evoke no contempt in the narrator to us it seems one of the meanest acts of one of the worlds great men poor mary walewska died for her enthusiasm  and in so doing only accentuated in her person the suffering entailed by the tyrant on the mass of her deluded countrymen the date is of course that of bonapartes presence in warsaw in 1807 when the revolutionary cloak had been abandoned and he was beginning to assimilate the pose of universal caesar the author a wellknown member of the school of sienkiewicz has given us a graphic study of polish society a century ago and the story though suffering to an english taste from rather too copious dialogue has many dramatic and some tragic passages while the characters especially that of the vain old courtier walewski are clearly cut the translation is well done but for a certain spasmodic method of conversation and a few slips of idiom,northamerica_contra

  quite alone new novels by george augustus sala 3 vols chapman  hall this novel is and will remain one of the curiosities of literature mr sala explains that half the story was written by him before leaving england as the correspondent of a daily paper more than a twelvemonth ago the publication of it was commenced at a later period in all the year round once engaged in america mr sala lost the thread of his narrative and when some hundred and twenty pages short of his goal ceased all remittances of manuscript it became necessary to bring the btory to an end and another hand was called in mr sala after returning to england preferring a close of his own very naturally promises his readers that if they will clear off the fiist edition as here given by the publishers of whom the ms appears to be the property he will write them a new last act we shall be very curious to see it under these circumstances the critic can only write in some sort conjecturally though five sixths of the tale are before him making allowance however for every drawback announced in this confession it would not be easy to name a more unpleasant story by a man whose fertility of invention and vivacity of style are indisputable  than this quite alone is unpleasant from the predominance of odious people to whom it introduces us blunt the heroine lilys father is one of those disgraceful men of pleasure who delight in flinging themselves down headlong ruining every one that touches or trusts themand whose death as it were on a dunghill excites more disgust than pity the diabolical french amazon who is

another man of profligacy and pleasure redeemed in part by his loving recollections of the child who had once sat on his knee during a greenwich orgy belongs we fear to the genus black swan re pulsive however as are many of the people jost enumerated mr sala nevertheless contrives to make us know them all and when he has finished his story in his own way he will perhaps have brought us to tolerate

into the worst provinces of bohemia which contain their magnates as well as the wretched swarm of folk that tumble for their pleasure may find excitement in  quite alone  quite alone is a franklyexpressed  advertisement mr sala explains how it came to pass that the present novel which originally appeared in weekly portions in a ll the year round and which bears his name as the author was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the year round began the publication of the story without waiting to have  quite alone by george augustus sb three tolumes london chapom hall the whole of the manuscript in their hands mr sala did his best to finish the task he had set himself but failed  page by page he says  like so many drops of blod about two hundred slips of manuscript oozed from me between spring and summer they were written with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and sudden death in the month of august

world among strange scenes and strange people hurrying from place to place badgered and hated always abused often in peril of my life and under all hazard compelled to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed it many steps beyond the outset from first to last the heroinewhose mysterious isolation suggests the title of the novelis the character of whom the reader is permitted to see and know least though it is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year

stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end clubloungers from the circumstance

  north of the tweed or lorance langton his life incidents and adventures in scotland by daniel crowberry 3 vols newby we have been highly amused with this book not that the author intended it to be funny far from it indeed it is the authors perfect unconsciousness of saying anything humorous that makes us laugh so the book is written with such profound gravity and selfcomplacency that what would otherwise be insufferable becomes very amusing we remember a parallel case some time ago there was an   i flr    amateur representation of  macbeth to which the numerous friends of the actors were compelled to go with anything but lively anticipations of enjoyment to their delight what was expected to bea most tedious affair turned out a perfect success macbeth was so wonderfully  got up and delivered his speeches with such preternatural solemnity and was evidently so delighted with himself and his acting that the audience roared again every syllabic he uttered caused shouts of laughter much to his astonishment but s hestillweuton in thc sam style he unwittingly kept up the fun to thc end of the enteiiaiinitnt by these means a badlyacted tragedy became a most enjoyable farce so hero thanks to our appreciation ot the humorous a tedious novel is made really amusing were it not for this we fear our criticism would be more severe as it is though author is perfectly safe we cannot find much fault with a book that has made us laugh so the author says in the third volume of  north of the tweed that it is not a novel at all perhaps this is some peculiar fun of mr crowberry some joke known only to a few for if it is not a novel what is it we really cannot say it certainly is not a book of travels nor a book of anecdotes it is perhaps best described as an edd and not very agreeable mixture of the three things the first volume so lav as we can judge was apparently intended for a novel at any rate there is some appearance of a tale  but to the readers surprise and our amusement this story comes to an abrupt termination at the end of the volume the second volume has no reference to the firstnor in faet t lung at all iii particular the hero of the first volume certainly appears iu though second but that is the only connexion between them it puzzles us to make out what mr crowberry intended the second volume to be we have thought over it and as a puzzle it h amusing but it beats us we cannot understand what it means it is such a curious medley that it must be read to be appreciated we warn the reader though that tue only entertainment he can hope to find is in wondering at the incongruities and pomposity of style beyond this he will be bored in the third volume the author takes another stait and having satisfied his taste for meandering in the second volume rathor inclines to give his audience another story this intention however is not strictly carried out for the meandering continue at diverse intervals throughout the last volume but still there is some kind of reference to a talc for which the reader will feel grateful or not according to his taste even the author shows once in the como of his work symptoms of an idea that it is not quite cn rijlc to drag into his novel stray anecdoteof about eighty pages or so wliei it has not the remotest connexion with what precedes and follows it and when mr crowberry himself owns that it is not amusing this remarkable once occurs at page 172 of the third volume we specify it thus particularly as it possesses a certain interest for though philosophical critic it proves that even though most eccentric author has occasional glimpses of right and wrong in reference to his novel just as the most depraved criminal occasionally exhibits signs of penitence and remorse so the author at this remarkable page 172 shows that even he knows what crimes he has been guilty of as a novelwriter this is what mr crowberry says   were we now engaged in writing a novel  it would become our first consideration to choose or invent such incidents for our work as seemed best calculated to sustain an uniform interest or stimulate the curiosity of those who honoured us with their favour such may be termed the high or popular road of romance but as we are occupied in recording a succession of humble events either relating personally to the subject of our narrative or coming directly under his observation in the courso of his rambling life ice are constrained to dealicith matters as they come before us commonplace as they may seem the present incident    possesses nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or cen to a place in our pages nothing beyond the actual fact of its existence enid of having attained consielereible notoriefy at the time of its occurrence observe in the beginning of this quotation how the guilty author tries to excuse himself while confessing his crime how natural this is  no man ever acknowledged himself guilty of a crime without a reservation the confession always nins  i know i did it but and the  but clearly proves it was some one elses fault that the crime in question was committed but what does mr crowberry mean by saying were we now engaged in writing a novel really when we listen to excuses like this we feel quite inclined to lose our good humour and be severe how can mr crowberry be so cool as to say that he is  constrained to deal with matters as they come before him commonplace as they may seem   who constrains him  certainly not the public in fact we cannot see how an englishman can be compelled to write a book though he had even contracted to do so the court of chancery itself would never decree specific performance of a contract to write a book it may be different in scotland  but even if it be so the courts in scotland ought clearly not to have constrained mr crowberry to publish his book in england there must be some mistake somewhere seriously mr crowberry is in this dilemma either he wrote to please the public or to please himself and a few friends in the first case it is clear he ought not to have wilfully written trash that he knew to be uninteresting to the public generally in though second case mr crowberry should have printed a few copies for private circulation when he published the book to the world the excuse as to his being compelled to write nonsense fell to the ground  for though he and his friends may prefer uninteresting and disconnected stories they have no right to force their peculiar taste on the public at large to conclude mr crowberry ought not to spoil a good confession by frivolous excuses the simple truth is the author knew to use his own words that the incident possessed nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or even to a place in his pages yet out of pure obstinacy he inserted it i knew i ought not to stead that coat and yet i did steal it that is the authors confession,northamerica_contra

literature ie a german known for his saasterj of englieh and proficiency in the stadtee of hit native van guage the combination waa the most fitting conceivable for a work of this kind selection and translation are alike characteristic and spirited  and with one exception we believe the tales to be quite new to the english reader the exception is the first tale the libusea of musasus a wellknown writer of the last century whose collection of popular stories volhs miirchen was edited by wieland his works ara classical but we must think them somewhat vulgar and cannot but applaud the omission of needless indelicacies in the translation of this very tale libussa is an excellent example of the spirit in which he took up old legends and of the halfmodern satirical garb he dressed them in two very powerful stories somewhat alike in their moral drift are the criminal from lost honour of schiller and the michael kohl haas of heinrich von kleist schillers would show that the extremes of guilt are never more surely engendered than by degrading punishments awarded to trivial offences von kleists that a man driven to desperation by the denial of justice may be made a criminal by his outraged sense of right this latter tale is unequal but we know few things in fact or fiction more masterly than the first half of it the scene where with forced calmness michael listens to the outrages committed on his servant is a piece of high tragedy the writer afterwards plunges into historical detail and somewhat soils his fancy with the thick dust of german chronicles but heinrich von kleist not to be confounded with an older author christian ewald von kleist was a remarkable person he belonged to what was called the romantic school bis works are edited by tieck at the beginning of the century and several of bis dramas particularly the kiithchen von heilbronn still keep the stage he bad a morbid aud sickly temperament and so much was this embittered by his hatred of the french invasion that he killed himself in 1811 when little more than thirty years of age two other stories in the collection may be named together as alike in tendency and belonging to the same class of vivid thoughtful satirical fantasy pieces these are the sandman of hoffman and the wonders in the spessart of karl von immermann we see in both the intention to laugh at the speculative and morbid tendencies of the germans and in both that nice and curious art which leaves the reader doubtful if the means employed have been fanciful or real there is no such natural form of supernaturalism as the german other nations at the best make clumsy work of it we should like to have quoted from the sandman which for the mingled satirical fantastical and horrible is a masterpiece of hoffmans brilliant genius but we can better detach one or two of the imaginative wonders of the spessart by immermann whose sudden death two or three years ago in the prime of his life and intellect was a great loss to german literature the hero of the story a disciple of albertus magnus in other words of the archspeculator hegel obtains sight of the interior life of the universe  in the block of mossy rock a light murmuring was audible it seemed as though the stone wished to move itself and could not like one in a trance the student looked upon its surface and lo i the green and red veins were running together into a very ancient countenance which from its weary eyes looked upon him with such a mournful and supplicating aspect that he turned aside with horror and sought consolation among the trees plants and birds  among these all was changed likewise when he trod on the short brown moss it shrieked and groaned at the unsentle pressure and he saw how it rung its little hairy ands and shake its gr j en or yellow heads the stems of the plants and the trunks of the trees were in a constant spiral motion and at the same time the bark or the outer skin allowed him to look into the inside where little sprites were pouring fine glistening drops into the tubes the clear fluid ran from tube to tube while valves unceasingly opened and shut until in the capillary tubes of the leaves at the very top it was transformed to a green bloom soft explosions and ure now arose in the veins of the leaves  their finely cut lips ceaselessly breathed forth a kind of ethereal flame while ceaselessly also the heavier part of those igneous phenomena glided about the leaves in soft waves of vapour in the bluebell flowers that were on though damp soil there was a ringing and singing they consoled the poor old me of stone with a lively song and told him that if they could only free themselves from the ground they would with right good will release him out of the air strange green red

expressed on the countenance of his ifutt hut on the fifteenth day it happened that the duke while at table sent for the dwarf presented him to his guest and asked bow he was satisfied with his cooking m  you are a wonderful cook replied the prince and know what good living is all the time 1 have been here you have not repeated a single dish and have prepared everything exquisitely hut pray tell me why have you not all this time prepared that queen of dishes the pie called  souseraine    the dwarf was startled at this question for he had never heard of this queen of pies however he recovered himself aud replied c my lord 1 was in hopes that your serene countenance would shine some time yet on this court therefore i deferred this dish  for with what dish ut the queen of pies should the cook honour the day of your departure v  indeed said the duke laughing  i suppose then you wish to wait for the day of my death to honour me for you have never yet sent it up to me but think of another dish to celebrate the departure for tomorrow that pie must be on the table m  your pleasure shall be done my lord replied the dwarf and retired but he went away uneasy for the day of his disgrace and misfortune had come he did not know now to prepare this pie isle went therefore to his chamber and wept over his fate when the goose mimi who was allowed to walk about came up and inquired the cause of his grief when she heard of the pie  dry your tears said she  this dish came often to my fathers tible and i know pretty well what is necessary for it you have only to take such and such things in certain quantities and should these not be all that are really necessary i trust that the taste of these gentlemen is not sulhciently refined to discover the deficiency  at these words the dwarf danced with joy blessed the day on which he had purchased the goose and set about making this queen of pies he first made a trial in miniature and lo the flavour was exquisite and the mastercook to whom he gave the small pie to taste praised once more his great skill l the following day he prepared the pie un a larger scale and after having garnished it with flowers sent it hot as it came from the oven to table after which he dressed in his best and went to the dining hall on entering he found the steward engaged in carving the pie and presentnig it on silver dishes to the duke and his guest the duke swallowed a large piece turned his eyes upward saying  ha  ha ha  jutlv is this called the queen of pies  but my dwarf is also a king of cooks is it not so my friend   his guest took a small morsel tasted it carefully and smiled somewhat scornfully and mysteriously the thing is made pretty well replied he pushing his plate away but it is not quite the soueraine as i well imagined  at this the duke frowned with indignation and turned red saying  you hound of a dwarf how dare you do this to your lord i i will have your big head cut off as a punishment for your bad cooking    1     ah my lord said tfte duart tremnung  xor neaveu s sake have compassion on me  i have made that dish indeed according to the proper receipt and am sure that nothing is wanting   tis a

exclaimed the dwarf shuffling on his knees up to the prince and clasping his feet  tell me what is wanting to this pie and why it does not suit your palate  let me not die for a handful of meat or flour   this will not avail you my good nose replied the prince laughing  even yesterday i thought you would not be able to make this dish as well as my cook know there is wanting a herb called sneezewithpleasure which is not even known in this country without it this pie is insipid and your master will never eat it in such perfection as i do  at this the duke flew into a rage and cried with flashing eyes   i will eat it in perfection yet for i wear by my princely honour that by toinoirou i will either have the pie set before you such as you desire it or the head of this fellow shall he

collected works of thomas hood some of us remember the pleasant hum and glow of expectancy with which we waited for the advent of one of his books far off its coming shone in the faces of young and old its presence was greeted with eyes that danced and lungs that crowed and sides that shook its merry memory was a joy for ever and there are the same human hearts to be set beating the same eager faces of youth to be set dimpling  the same wrinkles on the face of age to be turned into ripples of laughter now as of old there is no fear that these works will ever fail of their old effect thomas hoods poems anti punpictures whims and oddities have taken their place in our affections they now ask a little more room on our shelves and that we can promise for them their author has established his right as a favourite of the english heart to have all his writings carefully gathered and garnered up we like to know all we can of him and have all that we can of his whilst an author is living we only ask for his bestthe nuggets of his gold but when he is dead and gone we are glad to get the  washings and like to see careful hands seeking diligently for the golden grains we judge the writer by his lumps but do not despise the golddust thousands of faces will bend and brighten over these pages for more years than we can count merry eyes will twinkle with the light from these books so funnily reflected young faces will grow glorious and young voices uproarious a will goethe wisp light will flit about the family circle there will be sly ticklings at the very heartroots by a tricksy spirit and these will out suddenly in inextinguishable mirth there will be leaning heads of lovers that bend together with one heart over the book and two hands clasped beneath the table quiet chuckles of old hearts that laugh helplessly within there will be still higher reward for the writer the world will pay for its smiles in gold but keep its pearls of heart for those that make it weep this success is hoods and in shy ways and shady places a tear will be the still more eloquent witness of his moving powerthe noblest payment for the pleasure we find the wit untarnished by time  the fun has lost none of its freshness enjoyable as ever are the old perfectest of puns whether in picture or verse hoods puns flash every time they go offbeing for all not one time as for example his death which happened in his birth at fortyodd befell they went and told the sexton and the sexton tolled the bell or speaking of orient nations vhere woman goes to mart the same as mangoes or let us look at what we call his punpictures of the  whims and oddities it is noticeable that the wit kept some of his best wine  in the wood and dealt it out fresh on draught who ever tyres of that scene where the heads of two quakers are visible just above the ice on a bitter winters day and there they hang surveying each other in what ho would call an ice fix or state of suspended animation this he entitles a coolness between friendsor the view of a particularly bald old gentleman who has just upset a beehive and how doth the little busy bee improve each j shining second on the bald shining head  this i he calls an unfortunate beeingor the j  spoilt child wherein the servant is sitting with  the infant tinder her care she quietly reading her j paper and comfortably killing the child  then there is that unforgetable last in bed to put out the light wherein the worthy couple in all haste dash at the bedclothes making ends meet and heads clash at the same momentand its not a laughing matter but whos to put out the light  we might refer to an infinite variety of merry thoughts that will bear an endless picking out but in going over or even men j tioning the works of hood we are as leigh i hunt has said of wit and humour under a i st anthonys temptation reverseda laughable  instead of a frightful one for  thousands of  merry devils pour in on all sidesdoubles of similes buffooneries of burlesques stings in the  tails of epigrams glances of innuendoes dry looks j of ironies corpulences of exaggerations tick lings of mad fancies claps on the back of horse1 plays complacencies of unawarenesses flounder1 ings of absurdities irresistibilities of iterations j significances of jargons waitings of pretended  woes roarings of laughters and hubbubs of animal spirits the wit is showered down with all the opulence of a raincloud shedding its brightest most bountiful drops this not only represents his works but his way of working no sooner does a witty thought enter his head j but his mind is all mirrors with a hundred i reflections forthwith it is like that scene mentioned by sydney smith at the french embassy where he mistook the reflections of himself in the lookingglasses for a meeting of the clergy and not only does his mind reflect in this numerous way but it also refracts in a myriad forms that range from lilliput to brobdingnag and in every tint that can be conceived on any colourable pretext it is the moment of transformation in a mental pantomime hey presto and they are all at itchange on change and jest on jest come tripping on and tripping up and tripping over one another in as bright and bustling a bit of business as ever included the sparkle of harlequin the trick of clown the wise wag of pantaloons beard and the beauty of columbine every drop of ink from his pen every line from his pencil swarms into life with the most fantastic shapes ever assumed by the merriest imps of mirth and mischief that play bopeep with face and mask his puns are often unanswerably absurd or unutterably wise they arc the sort to suit charles lamb who next to a good pun loved a good bad one they either shut you up or you must laugh there is nothing else for it if you are wise you will laugh they are also the sort to obviate what charles lamb thought would be though greatest inconvenience of being in utter darkness viz if you made a pun you would have to feel all over your friends face before you knew whether he was enjoying it in fact it would have to be a broad grin for you to perceive it with hoods the laugh would be too ready and ringing he makes instant appeal to another kind of feeling he looked upon a pun he says as a horsewith him it was pegasushaving a pillion for an extra sense to ride behind it is warranted to carry either single or double and so perfectly does it carry that many a grave reader  will enjoy the single sober sense and never see the second rider that sits grinning behind or to change the illustration much of his wit was the mere flashes struck out by the hoofs of the winged horse of the muses amongst the fresh features that peep out from betwixt the old faces in these new volumes we are caught and tickled by a few of hie answers to correspondents in the london magazine marking his early punning propensity he kept the sign of the  lions head in those days people only saw the head but there was also the most appropriate wag to the tail one writer is informed that his  night is too long for the moon rises twice in it we do not know whether the author retorted that it must have been at least luminous the  essay on agricultural distress would only increase it the  tears of sensibility had better be dropped b is surely humming the  echo will not answer whilst it is suggested the  sonnet to the rising sun must have been written for a lark hoods higher humour is also alone and unparagoned there is nothing like it nothing we can place near it to say what it is like amongst those that have gone before it is  hoods own it never tastes bitter ia though mouth after the enjoyment it is not cynical or destructive or gross he never laughs with rabelais in his easy chair to roll down into though mud to us the brightest gems of his humour j seem trembling into tears surely they art j tears set glittering in the sunshine there is nothing hard and dry and merely shiny the lustre is moist like that of the buttercup above al there is the clearness of a good conscience the pureness of a high heart the i aroma of a mot sweet nature the cause of i an indescribable quality of hoods wit is that this is only his other way of crying the smile is that of a sad hearts sunshine the look is ineffably pathetic as that of some dear ailing child who laughs up in the mothers face to hide its suffering and ease her heart a little thc jewels we spoke of are indeed tears live from the heart they have not been polished for future use like sheridans and set to most advantage  each others beams to share in the midst of thc merriest mood the quick ear detects a strange arresting tone in the voice j like that note of the nightingales which pierces through all her ecstasy and brings the dew into our eyes you look round the smile is still on the face but you know well enough that he has just dropped a tear within its all very funny of course but he is only making mouths at his own troubles and light of his own heavy cares he was compelled as he said to make broad grins under narrow circumstances and be a livelyhood for a livelihood so he laughed for his living because puns sold better than poetry the public were too much delighted with mr merrymau on the stage to care for sadder shows behind only those to whose eyes had been added the  precious seeing of sympathy and who listened with the heart at the ear could tell what a world of sorrow there was in the voice thomas hood made many attempts to convince the world that there lay something in his nature deeper than the wit that sparkled  on the surface that there was the true hipi pocrene under all this effervescence and dance of frolic funthe body of the wine so to speak as well as this light spirit or soul of whim that bubbled up and beaded the surface this was only a kind of laughinggaa which would escape first and the world inhaled ic so readily and liked it so lightheadedly that it would not wait for or believe in the real wine hood himself pleaded his cause so humorously in his prefaces who could believe that he was sadly seriously in earnest why the very seriousness was only all the mons provocative of laughter a more cunning way of making merriment it was like liston insisting on playing tragedy and tickling ao foregone comic conclusions into irresistible laughter so the world would not have hoods best wine it would not let him dive down into the tragic gloom of his nature for the most precious jewels that lurked there it would not hear lum in his earnest mood it insisted like elizabeth with her portrait on having his presentment without shadow he must continue to ease his heartache by laughing or by making others laugh he refers to this humorously of course in his introduction to  tylney hall wherein two of his proofreaders turn tormentors and insist on it that he was laughing when he thought he had bein crying  thu muimis bogan and i confess to my astonishment his main objection to my novel insinuated a dearth of though pathetic  not he said  but there is abundance of bloodshed and shelli ling of tears  if i recollect rightly the second volume alone

punsand his pathos in ins witty rhymes his mind is continually catching the light at ihe oddest possible angle and this angle so to speak is a corner round which the two meeting extremes rush into

made warm with a beating hum heart we are inclined to prize these and other poems of pure fancy all the more because of the circumstances under which they were written their author had to do figuratively what the shipwrecked camoens did literally tint i bring his poetry on shore in his teeth having to strike out for his life with hands and feet it is a pity that he could not have been writing immortal poetry often when he had to make the accustomed pyrotechnic display of punsa pity that he had to grind down so much of his mental seedcorn into daily bread speaking of the poor poet whose ambrosia may be sure but whose bread is very uncertain he says  pure fame is a glorious draught enough and the striving for it a noble ambition  but alas few can afford to drink it neat across the loftiest visions of the poet eai thly faces will flit and even while he is gazing on castaly little familiar voices will murmur in his ear inquiring if there are no fish that can be eaten to be caught in its waters and there being no fish in castaly he had to angle in other streams and so he laughed and coughed laughed aud spit blood laughed and made the public laugh as we say till the tears ran down its face at last for it learned at length that this was  a fellow who could play the fool to a higher purpose than it had thought he will touch the heart yet as well as tickle the ear theres a barb to his arrow and when he has driven it well home you will scarcely feel inclined to play with the feather at the other end which winged it to the heart you invited him to a banquet of mirth and it went on merrily as though the feast would never end you asked for a jester to jingle the bells on follys cap and he did your bidding bonnily but he will also show you that motley is not the only wear he is no longer puck or clown or jester you look up and see a quiet man in black with a face gradually whitening and waning in the deathshadow there is a set sternness about his mouth a grim earnestness lights up the eye he has another story to tell now another song to sing he has risen to his highest stature lengthening in deathand in his grandest character to plead the cause of the poor no longer the funny favourite of the drawingroom he is out in the street singing a song that will thrill through the heart of england there is something singularly touching in the sound as of a voice almost choked with tears there is something doggedly stern in the march of the measure as though it must be uttered thus to get it out at all he sings the  song of the shirt and you must listen ladies who move so high above the world of the poor and sit in their beauty like pictures of life in the boudoirs frame of gold or lie down to sleep in a fairy land of rest will be compelled to come out on the balcony to hear more of the song and see more of the sights the poet has to show them kindhearted old gentlemen will lay down their paper with a  bless me and begin fumbling in their breechespocket many young men got a new glimpse of life and its duties from the moment that hood unveiled his two acts of one great tragedy of poverty and showed the grim facts naked in their sternness as shroudless corpses it is now twenty years since hood sang with a heart aching for humanity his famous  song of the shirt and the bridge of sighs but they left echoes in the heart of his country which can never die the rich and poor have in many ways and through many doors looked moro closely into the face of each other than they had ever done before and not only did those songs set many to work in all worthy ways inspiring many schemes for the alleviation of suffering and for the benefit of thetoiling poor they likewise left a subtler sense a readier ear a quicker sympathy on the part of the rich so that when the cry of want and distress runs like the fiery cross through the land there is an instantaneous response as in the case of our present great national calamity  the works of thomas hood the question colxdica neene pocaa  is as old at least as the time of horace and few in the present day would share his hesitation in giving an affirmative answer but the critic of hood is mnet at the outset by the further inquiry whether real excellence of both kinds serious and comic is likely to be found in the same writer that such a combination is possible is settled conclusively by the example of shakespeare but one swallow does niot make the spring the fact we take to be this that the highest poetical genius is inseparable from some sense of humour just as the deepest moral earnestness is never disjoined from irony  witness to go no further platos dialogues and st pauls epistles mliltons genius was essentially trafgic but he condescended to a punning elegy on the  university carrier burns is as felicitous when he is funny as when he is pathetic  the power of the author of  in mlenoriam  is not least conspicuous in the grimn hunmour of the  vision of sin on the other hand  comic genius of the highest order could hardly exist without almost equal powers of an opposite kind though many accidents of temperament or circuhlnstance might prevent their being equally displayed  but the converse does not hold true to the same extent it is impossible to doubt that aristophanes could have written tragedies had he been so minded but we cannot conceive a1schylus composing the frosg these remarks seem the natural preface to a notice of hood who is about equally admired as a comic and a serious author and has in both capacities attained considerable eminence his prose works though the most bulky are the least impol ant portion of his remains the contributions to the  comic annual are the most characteristic and the best and as e p hemueral proluctions deserving of high praise but even these occasionally give us the impression of a writer who had to say something rather than of one who had something to say his national tales a series of short love stories are readable but commonplace in fact nature clearly did not intend him for a novelist his only elaborate attempt of the kind  tylney hall cannot be considered a success there are several amusing people among the minor characters and some very amusing scenes as especially mr twiggs feat shampeter but the principal characters of the tale or those who ought to be such are inadequately drawn and the plot is unnatural and melodramatic to the last degree with a superabundant allowance of villainies and murders it is in fact merely an average sensation novel with humorous incidents interspersed and if it repays perusal it is for the sake of the fun not of the story hoods humour is genial rather than caustic and  the works of thomas hood comic and serious in pros and verse edited with notes by his son seven vuls loudon efward moxon  co doverstreet 1862 reminds us more of dickens than of thackeray but he does not share the peculiar facility of the former in delineating the grotesque aspects of life below stairs or rival the power of either in sustained elaboration of character justice rivers mr twigg uriah bundy and unlucky joe are admirable sketches in their way  but there are no pecksniffs or becky sharps a charitablydisposed lady once said when asked her opinion of a very dull sermon that it was entirely on the side of religion and virtue this praise may safely be accorded to all that hood has written the moral is excellent but it is not always iu pressive in a  voyage up the rhine consisting of imaginary letters from different members of the travelling party to their friends at home he is far more successful there is little pretence of a regular story and plenty of room for play of wit the hypochondriac uncle who  went off at once quite insensible and was at the point of death every time he fell into an aifterdinner nap  the conventional english tourist railing at foreign customs and raving incoherently in foreign churches  and the estimable mrs twisleton who never closed her eyes for a week after catholic emancipation for fear of being converted in her sleep are but specimens of the general style of these highly entertaining epistles which might be indefinitely multiplied indeed the essentially comic nature of  our family the authors last novel left unfinished at the time of his death shows that he had then learned where his true strength as a prose writer lay we rise from the perusal of this portion of his works with the impression strong on our minds which was lately expressed by a successor and admirer of hoods in one of the  roundabout papers that he would have been a very charming person to know and be able to talk to nor will that impression be at all diminished when we turn as we must now do from his prose to his poetry the shorter poems like the shorter stories are better than the long ones and chiefly for the same reason it is in brief brilliant flashes whether of wit or of sentiment that hoods peculiar genius is most conspicuous the  plea of the midsummer fairies is decidedly wearisome hero and leander though generally musical and in parts very touching disappoints us as a whole and if to take a very different example  miss kilmansegg and her precious leg  be quoted against us we must reply that there too particular passages witty or pathetic form the main attraction it is rather in pathos than in power that the speciality of hoods serious powers must be sought of the latter the most striking instance is to be found in the terrible dream of eugene aram  of the former kind is the famous  song of the shirt the ladysdream  is less known but almost equally touching and oh those maidens young who wrought in that dreary room with figures drooping and spectres thin and cheeks without a bloomand the voice that cried  for the pomp of pride we haste to an early tomb for the pomp and pleasure of pride we toil like afric slaves and only to earn a home at last where yonder cypress wavesand then they pointedi vever saw a ground so full of grates   in the simplicity of the closing lines lies the secret of their exquisite pathos hood is eminently the reverse of shelley he does not idealise abstractions or dwell a hermit spirit in a land of hopes and joys and dim surmises impervious to vulgar ken his instinct is for the actual circumstances and sorrows of human life and it is mainly by particular recollections or the sufferings of particular classes as in the poems just referred to that his imaginative sympathies are evoked he throws himself outward on the world as it is not inward on his own conception of what it ought to be burning with indignation indeed against tyranny and wrong but not turning in disgust from a universe he would fain remodel almost in defiance from its maker hood would scarcely have comprehended  alastor or the  revolt of islam  still les would he have shared the strange idiosyncracy which found expression in the  cenci shelley sensitive enough to be  tender over drowning flies would have thoroughly entered into the sentiment which dictated the  song of the shirt but he would never have written it not indeed that the genius of hood can for a moment be put into competition with shelleys we have contrasted them for the sake not of marking the difference of power but the difference of idea both are in temper eminently unselfish both earnest lovers of their kind but the same feeling expresses itself in widely different forms and while to the few who can appreciate him shelley with all his faults cannot fail to be priceless hood will be popular for precisely the reasons which must prevent shelley from ever becoming so he utters feelings which all who have hearts can realize and in language which all can understand the poem to which these remarks least apply and alone of all which we have noticed does somewhat remind us of shelley is his fragment on the  sea of death sad were my thoughts that anchord silently on the dead waters of that passionless sea unstirrd by any touch of living breath silence hung over it and drowsy death like a gorged seabird slept with folded wings on crowded

sonnets  for instance that addressed  to an enthusiast and to  a sleeping child hood like all true poets is fond of children his comic poems are perhaps as compositions imore original though it would not be fair to say that they are more characteristic of the man that he could feel truly and deeply would be evidenced if only by his touching lines to a false friend never published during the authors lifetime with their bitter thricerepeated refrainc our hands have met but not our hearts our hands will never meet again  indeed his poems bear witness in every line to a genial nature and warm heart such feelings however are scarcely distinctive characteristics but hoods wit and play upon words is peculiarly his own so far he was probably right in thinking his speciality lay in punning this forms the charm of several of his prose writings but it comes out even more conspicuously in miany of his shorter poems the wellknown conclusion of faithless sally brown may be taken as a typical specimen of his felicitous punning c his death which happened in his berth at fortyodd befell they went and told the sexton and the sexton tolled the bell with which may be compared a verse of another

their manners and utter sighs like prisoners a great authority has lately expressed regret that hood from a false estimate of his own nobler capabilities should have devoted so much time to merely making jokes instead of taking his station as  a true genius and poet we have no wish certainly to depreciate his power of drawing our tears as well as exciting our laughter and are free to confess that we attach a much higher value to the former than to the latter gift we regret too that the constant pressure of literary engagementsfor hood did not write for his own pleasure merelyand a career cut short by premature death did not leave him time and opportunity to cultivate more fully his graver vein of thought some things he has written so exquisite in their mournful melody that we cannot help wishing we had more still we can hardly agree with mr thackeray in thinking he mistook his vocation when he devoted so much time to comic writing a man who instinctively jokes on his deathbed

  the relentless city by e f benson heinemann 6s as a satirist of expense mr benson is perhaps unexcelled among contemporary novelists and it is not therefore surprising to find many readable and vivacious pages in a novel which introduces an american millionaire with an exceedingly ambitious wife the relentless city is new york which mr benson visited last year which is presented with the rhetoric of disgust some of which even the statue of liberty inspires one characteristic fete in which an imported pearl fishery and floating refreshment tables are conspicuous items is memorably described but the dominant note of the book is perhaps rather expense of labourinability to rest than mere expenditure of cash the narrative or romantic structure of the novel is not convincing an english nobleman pays fifteen thousand pounds in blackmail to get back a letter which merely expresses an infatuation for an actress who was too magnanimous to live with him the actress herself is reminiscent of one of mr grundys stageheroines played by mrs langtry and she is responsible for the epigram  england is the home of linenwashing in public it is the one industry that remains to us there is a rather disagreeable episode of a young man who uses a consumptive tendency as a means of kindling a womans heart and from it one turns with candid relief to the pretty idyl of the english lord and the millionaires delightful daughter mr benson has certainly produced shapelier novels than this it may be urged too that his satire is rejoicingly obvious and in this instance sometimes badtempered  the fact remains however that he is interesting apart from artistic considerations his wit being infectious though controlled at irregular intervals by a sincere gravity that may be described as though shadow of lambeth palace  the relentless city bv e f benson 6 heinem inn a novel from amr benson always promiscs two things a surface of worldliness and triviality and an

brilliant as incisive as ever but it cannot be called anything else in  the luck of the vails melodrama was evident even in the  book of months which was fundamentally a by  product of mr bensons loom a keen observer could here and there note the prevalent tendency in the relentless city it appears naked and not ashamed melodrama in its middlevictorian guise each timehonoured character performs his appropriate timehonoured actions there is a maidenly heroine a hero in the primaeval guise of a belted earl who loves and marries her and an immoral but virtuous actress with whom the hero has had an early entanglement there is also a wicked villain who forges blackmailing letters to the hero seeming to proceed from the actress and causing temporary distress to the heroine the villain dies as is inevitable by violence being run over by a locomotive in a tunnel there are variations on the old theme of course the heroine is not a village beauty she is the heiress of an american millionaire the villain is not a baronet but another american millionaire the lovers are married before the villain becomes villainous instead of afterwards and he has no evil designs upon the heroine but matrimonial ones upon another lady altogether incidentally we get some capital descriptions of new york and of the manners and customs of its privileged four hundred,northamerica_contra
  the disentanglers bv andrew lang 6s lung mr andrew lang is everything by turnshe is a sort of intellectual jackofalltrades but master of manv poets may prefer him as an essayist essayists as a novelist novelists as a historian historians as a poet but to the public he is very welcome in each capacity his novels may not be great but the are indubitably good and this latest of them the disentanglers testifies no less to his versatility than to his unfailing ability it does not run on the lines of sherlock holmes or on those of stevensons  arabian nights but whilst it has certain features in common with both of these famous series it has a freshness of outlook and invention and is written in a style that is the style of lang only merton and logan two impecunious young men seeking a way to make money hit upon the idea of starting an agency that ihdl unite the ordinary duties of the private detective with the more delicate disentangling of unsuitable matrimonial engagements and family mysteries and difficulties they engage a staff of male and female assistants and the adventures in which they become involved in the pursuit of their calling are extremely varied and diverting the book has humour of the quietly cynical kind that mr lang affects everal of the stories are strongly seasoned with sensation ome are fantastically improbable and yet so

fiction would be likely to write the idea of  the disentanglers if farfetched is passable the mission of the society whose founders are the heroes of the book and whose  proceedings  constitute its matter is to save people from marrying unsuitable persons when a scion or relative becomes entangled  with the wrong lover when a perfectly impossible engagement looms ahead then the problem for the family for hundreds of families is to get the undesirable marriage off without the usual row    daughters become anannic foreign cures are expensive and no good son goes to the devil or the cape aged and opulent but amorous parent leaves everything he can scrape together to disapprovedof new wife relations cut each other all round not many people really enjoy that kind of thing they want a pacific

beautiful attractive young or not so young well connected intellectual athletic and of all sorts of types but all broke all without visible means of subsistence they are people welcome in country houses but travelling thirdclass    they go down and disentangle the amorous bywell by entangling them the lovers are off with the old love the love which causes all the worry without being on with the new love the thing quietly fizzles out decidedly there is promise of wild impossible comedy here in competent hands the thing might have achieved distinction but mr lang treats it loosely hurriedly and unoiiginally some of the adventures are a mixture of r l stevenson and mrs l t meade others resemble the productions of mr jacobs watered down with  three men in a boat the book reads in a word as though it had been thrown off  for a lark  by an author facile enough to produce an imitation of anything whatever in the british museum or at mudies vast portions of it are padding chiefly conversations of the literarysmart order  arrangements in dialogue of mr langs customary effervescence the book reeks with scraps of french and latin mythological allusions and journalistic references

excessively tedious in one of the adventures a member of the gang has to deliver to a provincial literary society as part of a disentangling intrigue a lecture on the  use and abuse of novels mr lang

  new novels the rose of life by m e braddon hutchinson  co the mighty influence of the zeitgeist is plainly discernible in this latest work of the veteran novelist thirty years ago it would have seemed unlikely that miss braddon would ever write a novel depending for interest less on plot than characterization yet such is the enterprise which she has here not unsuccessfully achieved the popular poet with his attractive egotism his ready though chiefly vicarious philanthropy and his genuine superiority to snobbishness and all its works is well conceived and so harmoniously developed that when he is detected in the act of swindling one of his best friends the disclosure though dramatically unexpected does not strike us as inconsistent with what we already know of him his simpleminded devoted wife is also good in her way and has the merit rare in that particular type of woman of conciliating sympathy rather than rousing irritation the villains male and female the heroine and the titular hero are none of them of much account and the device of the bigamous marriage scarcely appeals to us as it did in the days when it was a comparatively new thing in fiction,northamerica_contra

  queen lucia this is decidedly one of the most amazing and clever stories that mr benson has written  there is a cleverness that maketh bitterness to abound says an old jewish sage it is a kind of cleverness which is familiar in fiction as well as in social intercourse an unfeeling smartness which is satirical and sarcastic modern society especially in the case of idle rich people must be a constant temptation to the clever novelist and mr benson has already shot his arrows at the crazes of society women in particular but in this novel he is genial and delightful there is no acid touch of superiority he describes the life of a little community called riseholme in which the leading spirit is mrs emmeline lucas  she was always known among her subjects as lucia pronounced of course in the italian mode la luciathe wife of lucas  her little social ruses her affectation of culture her pseudoenthusiasms and her friendships are the theme of the novel which fairly brims with goodhumoured fun the advent of a mock indian guru and of two spiritualistic   queen lucia by e f benson 8s 6d net hutchinson charlatans are the main incidents which ruffle the pool of life at riseholme but a great operatic singer also takes up residence in the community and these changes threaten to burst the social harmony of queen lucias domain in fact she is exposed and humiliated during the course of affairs but this is where mir benson saves the situation he might easily have ended the book in a minor tragedy but he takes the better way and by bringing out the magnanimity of the actress he leaves riseholme still under the sway of its queen his light deft touch handles the situation without spoiling it the result is that we get our novel from beginning to end in the same vein mr benson amuses us with the silly crazes for vegetarianism christian science eastern mysticism spiritualism and the rest of the decadent enthusiasms which occupy the minds of unoccupied people he makes us familiar from the inside with the members of the riseholme society till we know  georgie with his false hair his embroidery and his uncomfortable sisters daisy quantock the colonel and the rest of them but while we laugh at them the laughter is not harsh it is satire with the buttons on the foils de congratulate mir benson upon this clever little sketch it is artistic and thoroughly llnulsing james moffattr,northamerica_contra
  fiction thorley weir by e f benson smith elder and co 6s there is never any question about the interest of t mr e f bensons stories they invariably claim if possible an uninterrupted attention they have however generally one improbable character or one who behaves rather improbably in certain situations here we have craddock a cool calculating man who makes a fine income by employing his artistic sense and knowledge in shady waysprincipally by obtaining from promising young authors and painters an option on their work for three years ahead posing meanwhile as a generous patron by giving them cheques which seem handsome to the inexperienced youths but which are trivial compared with what they might have earned had their subsequent plays and pictures been in the open market craddock is very cleverly drawn but for such a capable man of the world he collapses quite too easily when cornered and detected in some underhand dealings however the story is undoubtedly interesting and worthy of all the praise which it will surely obtain the plot it will be seen is original and the river scenes in which the love affair of the young artist is set are in mr bensons best vein several of the characters touch almost overstep the line of comedy and come perilously near the realm of farce but are saved just in time the relations of the artist and his charming mother are excellently shown and form one of the most pleasing features of a capital novel,northamerica_contra

  fiction a tale of the mutiny on the face of the waters by flora annie steel william heinemann mrs steels new story has been sj highly praised already vide press notices passim as quoted in the advertisements that if it were merely for the sake of a change one would be inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses there is a danger we hope it is no more that a somewhat uncritical admiration for the work of the clever lady who has now come to be spoken of as the female rudyard kipling  may do harm both to the authoress and her public the description is neither elegant nor correct for mrs steels resemblance to mr kipling begins and ends in the fact that both write about india from intimate personal knowledge and that the resemblance should strike both critics and public so forcibly is a remarkable sign of the novelty with which this inside handling of indian subjects came upon the masses in whose name our great dependency is ruled is it too much to express a fear that mrs steel has been tempted by thi reception to imagine that she has a mission to inform the british public about the true history of india  in her latest book at any rate the element of history seems to us entirely to overbalance the fiction we hasten to say that so far as the facts are concerned they are admirably portrayed mrs steels capacity as a historian of the indian mutiny is undeniable she is soaked through and through with knowledge of the environment in which she sets her story she is no partisan and her heroworship is combined with justice but after all fiction is fiction it is with some apprehension that the present writer who was one of the first to call attention to the power and beauty of those short sketches of mrs steels which came out anonymously in macmillans sees the authoress compelled to begin her new story with a preface insisting on its historical accuracy and explaining that it intended to be history as well as  story in her own criticism that in such an attempt she will probably fail in either aim mrs steel seems to us to be a better oritic of herself than most authors are it is not from a novelist that we want  every incident scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather it is not for the writer of fiction to boast that i have not allowed the actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings let the local colour be correct by all means but wc make a fetish of realism if such restrictions are put upon what in its essentials is an imaginative art the account of though sham court at delhi says mrs steel  did not need a single touch of fancy in the presentment what a singularly humiliating confession this statement should be if it were true in point of fact as all writers of picturesque history know it cannot be literally true it would only mean that the fancy of one writer was adopted by another and when that other is herself an artist in fiction the result if faithfully pursued would be a literary calamity not so do the great artists use history as scott in ivanhoe or george meredith in vittoria they learn its uses and its limitations the test of the historian is his accuracy but the critic must test mrs steele as a novelist not by her descriptions of the real scenes of the indian mutiny nor by her clever transcriptions of the chronicles but by the human beings and human characters wbich she invents the passions and ideas with which she invests them by the play of her creative talent round the creatures of her imagination as they move through the world which she has chosen as their environment and by her capacity for making an artistic unity out of the variety of circumstances it is in this respect that on the face of the waters is weak the desire to tell the whole history of the siege of delhi has interfered seriously with the human interest in the story up to p 210 there is a definite elot in the relations between major erlton is wife and his mistress but when mrs gissing falls the first of the women victims at delhi mrs steel violently removes the whole moral situation to which she seemed to be working upremoves it just at the climax when mrs erlton learns that another woman is to be a mother by her husband in a scene which till its natural sequel is ruthlessly cut off is full of promise for the working out of a most interesting problem of life alice gissing is certainly the most human of the characters in this story her relations with erlton whose wife is represented at first as bound to him by the nominal tie only are described with rare and even audacious sympathy  and when this chain of circumstance is abruptly snapped there is nothing to take its place the final two hundred pages one half of the book have no real human interest except the historical one mrs steel apparently intended the relations between jim douglas and mrs erlton to supply it but the sympathy of the reader is not aroused their adventures in the town in hiding while the mogul reigns in delhi and the british troops are besieging it from the ridge are most brilliantly narrated but they are the adventures of isolated beings both of them as bloodless as any men or women could be in such a situation and mrs steel evidently felt the mechanical aspect of their union after major erltons death when she relegated it to an appendix this division of the story into two parts one dealing with alice gissing and major erlton and the other with mrs erlton and jim douglasdeprives it of unity which is not adequately attained by the part played by douglas in both portions what unity the volume has is given by its history of the siege of delhi and to say this is to praise mrs steel the historian at the expense of mrs steel the novelist while we maintain that a great novel is not to be composed bv giving an historical background to several brilliantly interwoven episodes it must be admitted that mrs steel does ive us of her best in the way of episode in on the face of the waters all that relates to the natives whether to the sepoys or the court or the town is admirable and the sketches of british military and civil life are absolutely convincing mrs steel sees detail everywhere and records it minutely but she is full of humanity in the broader sense and can give us the mysticism of the oriental as faithfully as the easyoing morality of the angloindian each incident almost each chapter is a picture by itself revealing an extraordinary wealth of descriptive power and a masterly insight into character the disappointment is that with so muoh that is brilliant by itself the book as a whole finally lacks the intense interest which would be expected but mrs steel is so exceptionally gifted that we shall hope to see her shake off the disintegrating tendency which has so fatally pursued some of our best writers of sketches and short stories  novel notes on the face of the waters by f a steel 6s heinemann we do not meet with a novel of this order once in ten years it is a monument of patient labour a storehouse of precise facts on its imaginative side it is strong and deeply impressive architecturally it is a wonderbut we did not recognise this very early mrs steels aim was to write a history of the indian mutiny which should at the same time be a work of fiction the fiction to serve the history by lighting it up with living human interest as to her facts she says the reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part which real men took in it is scrupulously exact even in the date the hour the scene the very weather a critic of fiction has most concern with the other part and there we hold that mrs steel has used her vast array of knowledge with great skill that she has made us realise as we never did before the signs of the oncoming storm the mystery and tragedy of it the sensations of the natives loyal and disaffected and of the angloindians no one has taken such trouble before save historians and they have left the imagination out of the fineness of the detail it is impossible to speak too highly or of the great mental force that has shaped the mass of facts personalities sensations into a whole but it has the defects of its qualities a reader is sometimes overwhelmed dazed and baffled by the demands on his attention such a book should be given its best chancewhich is the careful consideration of ample leisure it is not a playhour novel but a bit ot hard reading with matter in it to reward the labour and to rouse the keenest admiration for the writers force and her sympathetic imagination  on the face of the waters new novels by flora annie steel heinemann mrs steel says in her preface  i have not allowed fiction to interfere with fact in the slightest degreeevery incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part real men took in it is scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather nor have i allowed the actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings this statement is we believe strictly accurate and the local colouring is singularly exact the tale too is as valuable as it is interesting for it gives an excellent insight into the native side of the indian mutiny and into the characters of some of the leading personages  such as for instance the king and queen of delhi the moulvie and bukht khan on the other hand it brings vividly before us the conduct and bearing of some of the principal fighters on the british side such as nicholson and hodson moreover it most wholesomely revives our recollection of the scandalous behaviour of the majorgeneral commanding at meerut and the want of energy and independence displayed by brigadier archdale wilson the author notwithstanding her general accuracy has perpetrated one or two little mistakes for example she defines krani as lowcaste english whereas it really is the contemptuous term applied to halfcastes again she is historically inaccurate when she writes of the rifle brigade having been engaged at budle  ke  serai it was the 60th rifles who took part in that action the rifle brigade not having been represented in india till

response to an appeal powerfully made in a great cause the book at the head of this article is one of the answers to mrs stow which have appeared on the other side of the atlantic it is also written by a ladya lady who appears to be familiar with the ways of negro life in virginia if not farther south mrs eastman is dogmatic and decisive she talks of the northerner with a freedom and a vehemence that would suggest nothing but gunpowder and thc bowieknife to the more peppery spirits of the other sex in a long preface to her story she defends slavery against all assailants as  gods own institutionand in a still longer appendix she derides and denies all the facts and points brought forward in mrs stowes narrative the laugh is certainly sometimes on her side she makes herself merry at the idea of uncle toms power of converting negroes  certainly the weak point of mrs stowes book and maliciously reminds the reader that cassy steals  money and tells lies after her miraculous con i version in the ginhouse she is still more dclighted to throw a lance at the  strongminded  women of new england and is particularly  happy in her sarcasms on the doings of a certain j female society for setting the world to itights j she even intimates that the strong minded will  not object to a little lying when it suits their i benevolent purpose as for example i  as regards the practice of marking negroes in  the hand i look upon it as one of the imaginary i horrors of the timcsa delusion like spiritual rap i pings got up out of sheer timidity of disposition i though i have heard of burning old women for  witches in new england and placing a scarlet letter i on the bosom of some unhappy one who had already j sorrow and sin enough to boar it wont do the  subject has without doubt been duly investigated i already id be willing were i not opposed to betting to bet my best collar and neck ribbon that a committee of investigation has been appointed consisting of twelve of bostons primmest old maids i and they have been scouring the plantations of the i south bidding the negroes hold out their hands not  as the poor souls will at first suppose that they may be crossed with a piece of silver and that they are now returning crestfal len to their native city not having seen a branded hand in all their journeying could aught escape their vigilance but they will say they saw a vast number and that will answer the purpose but these are points which we must leave the ladies to settle amongst themselves of course mrs eastman has no such slaveowner to show in her corps de ballet as legree because as she says no such monster ever lived except in the person of the northern professor who murdered his creditor for a mere matter of money  our readers shall if they please make the acquaintance of aunt phillis and her husband uncle bacchusthe last first notwithstanding the etiquette because the sketch gives us a full glimpse into negro life as the virginia slaveowners would have the world believe it now to exist  it was just sundovn but the servants were al at home after their days woik and they too were enjoying the pleasant evening time some were seated at the door nf their cabin others lounging on the grass all at cvse and without care jw any of their comfortable uibiiis had been recently v hunwashed and were adorned wili little garden in front over the one nearest the house a multiflon roic was creeping in full bloom singularly mtkica voices were heard at into vas singing snatches ol songs of a style in which the servants of the south specially delight and not unfreiiuently as the fu j chorus was shouted by a number their still mer peculiar laugh was heard above it all mr barbour had recently returned from a tur in our northern  states had been absent fr two months and felt that  he had not in as long a time witnessed such a scene ol real enjoyment isle thought it would have softened the heart of the sternest later of southern institutions to have beena spectator herc it might possibly have inclined him to think though sun of his creators beneficence shines over every j art of our favoured land take a teat my dear sir mr

blessed grief miss alice said he  shed make me eat de bottle chaw up all de glass swaller it arter dat i aint ever tried dat yetbest not to i reckon no master i intends to keep sober from this time forrud till young master comes back it is thus throughout the slaves are weak a little lazy move than a little given to strong waters and their owners are uniformly mild affectionate and indulgent but listen to the story of aunt phillis the black heroine of this book she was a firm believer in the bible and often pondered on the words of the angel return nnd submit thyself to thy mistress she had on one occasion accompanied her master and mrs weston to the north where she was soon found out by some of that disinterested class of individuals called abolitionists in reply to the question are you free there was but a moments hesitation her pride of heart gave way to her inherent love of truth ill tell no lieshe answered i ama slavewhy do you not tale your freedomwas the rejoinder  you are in a free state they cannot force you to the south if you will tike the offer we make you and leave your master you are abolitionists i spose asked philliswe are they said and we will help you off i want none of your help said phillis  my husband and children are at home but if they wasnt i nm an honest woman and am not in the habit of taking anything ill never take my freedom if my master would give it me and the rest of us i should be thankful i am not going to begin stealing and i fifty years of age an eyewitness described the straightening of her tall figure and the indignant flashing of her eye also the discomfited looks of her northern friends i have somewhere read of a fable of iceland according to it lost souls are to be parched in the burning heat of hecla and then cast for ever to cool in its neverthawing snows although phillis could not have quoted this her opinions would have applied it for some reason it was evident to her mind for she had been well instructed in the bible that slavery was from the first ordained as a curse it might to her high spirit have been like burning in the bosom of hecla but taking refuge among abolitionists was from the many instances that had come to her knowledge like cooling in its neverthawing snows with mrs eastman slavery is all bedecked with flowers and besprinkled with rosewater it is sweet to the sense and consoling to the heart with her it is a beautiful and interesting thing to be a slaveand the worst that can happen to a quadroon or a negress is to gain her freedom one of the figures of her storysusanlistens to the abolitionists and gets entrapped into personal liberty but repenting thereof she begs to be made a slave againwhen her mistress makes an example of her and refuses to take her back this has been the prattle of men in all times in reference to the peculiar institution when burly old johnson poured out one of his scornful denunciations of slavery little boswell held up his hands in pious horror and declared that  to abolish the slavetrade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind listen to one little anecdote told hy mrs eastman pfirenthetically when she ceases for a moment to write fiction and rises into history  we have n servant woman named phillis her price is far above rubies her industry her honesty her attachment to our family exceed everything i wish abolitionists would imitate one of her virtues humility i know of no poetry more beautiful than the hymns she sang to me in my infancy her whole life has been a recommendation of the religion of the bible i wish my chance of heaven were half as good us hers she is a slave here but she is destined to he a saint hereafter we think mrs eastman here as in many another place where she thinks she is building an argument is very unconsciously giving it a dangerous side blow that is the fault of her materials the tools with which she works are sharpedged and they cut her own case  if mrs eastman received a visit from an angel would she like to detain the celestial stranger for a place in the sugar plantations or to put the case lower would she like to keep in bondage the heir to an earldom or principality knowing him to be rich and certain tc inherit his estate in due course or like the king who keeps a fool or the quack who hires a poet does sne think it respectable and in the way of business for a virginian planter to owr a saint  our readers will have seen by this time that this advocate for  god8 own institution is more earnest than adroit she means to put in a good word for the lords and masters of the southbut her nonadmissions and su gestions support in a remarkable manner the conclusions which on this side of the atlantic most people would draw from the perusal of such works as  uncle toms

  rose macleod fiction by alice brown archibald constable and co ltd 6s  rose macleod  is less a novel than a series of interesting psychological studies thrown into narrative form the scene is laid in america and the time is the present  but neither time nor place has any important bearing on the story itself throughout the book incident is felt to be of subsidiary importance to characterisation and miss brown has succeeded in creating two or three at least unforgettable types her characters frequently repel but they always interest and they always ring true we must make an exception however in the case of osmond grant over whom the author has lavished considerable pains but whom it is impossible for the reader to visualise as a human being he appears indeed as divested of many of the attributes of humanity his deformity of body coinciding with a sublime monstrosity of mind he is an ideal of splendid masculinity as conceived by a sympathetic woman not a man that may be met and known it is in the delineation of her minor characters that the art of miss brown challenges our admiration madam fulton and electra aie neither of them attractive characters indeed it is difficult to say which is the more repulsivethe flippant worldliness of the old woman or the graceless and sterile perfection of the young girl but miss brown has enabled us to realise the essential tragedy underlying each existence and our sympathy is perforce evoked when we read of  florrie dying in the presence of her elderly lover still clutching with eager fingers at some new and untried delight or of electra going forth on her futile mission to meet the inevitable disillusionment and bitterness ot failure rose herself is one of the most delightful heroines that we have yet encountered but to marry her to osmond is to spoil an otherwise irreproachable novel  rose macleod by alice brown 6s constable you 1o not remember mliss alice browns stories for any mystery or intricacy of plot or violence of sensation but because of the charm and quaint quiet humour of her style and the easy lifelikeness of her characters it is these same qualities that unfailingly delight you in rose macleod taking a handful of more or less ordinary people miss brown shows them in their homes scattered within reach of each other on a new england countrysideold madam fulton who has outlived a modest sort of distinction as a very average novelist and yearning for a little fun has just published a volume of recollections more or less imaginary that are booming her into fame madams coldly beautiful serious purposeful granddaughter electra who attends lectures and likes to fuss about importantly and take a hand in  movements billy stark the publisher over on a visit from london the excellently gentle lovable grannie grant who keeps the farm near by her bighearted shrinking hunchback grandson osmond her younger grandson peter a brilliant artist who has studied in paris and new york has sold a great picture and comes home crowned with honour and of course rose macleod the daughter of a notorious labour agitator in whom she has ceased to have any faith and the daily lives of these people open out before you until you are as intimate with them and as keenly interested in their loves and hopes and fears as if they were actually alive and you knew them in the flesh it is a story that might be true about men and women who are as real as if they had been drawn from life a book that is wholly pleasant to read and fragrant in remembrance,northamerica
  the proof of the pudding by edwin punn chanman and hall hc mr pugh confections for us a rather jolly farce with a slightly sentimental flavour impersonation that basis on which nearly all farces are founded is given a novel twist the rightful heir to property requests someone to impersonate him as the thought of having to sustain the honours and dignities of a title and large estates wearies his independent bohemian soul a professional neerdowell takes up the task and the humour and gaiety of the book come out in the chapters when the supposed heir from australia receives visits from his old friends from places with names like wooloomooloo his comical attempt to reconcile his unacquaintance with them and his desire to preserve his impersonation make really amusing reading the sentimental portion of the book we do not take very seriouslyobviously one is not meant to mr pughs pudding is well made and digestible the recipe is an old and trusted one and if we remember aright he has used it on several previous occasions to turn out puddings of a similar kind to the present one it is a stock dish made of homely ingredients but the cook has cunning and will always find a number of ready appetites for his provisions   the proof of the pudding by edwin pugh chapman and hall 6s if the reader of this exciting and ingenious story only allows himself to believe the central idea of the plot the fulcrum upon which we might say the whole affair is moved all is well that a young and needy artist should be so utterly bohemian as not only to sacrifice the peerage to which he was legitimately entitled but to set another man an absolute stranger who bore a passable facial resemblance to himself to occupy that high position in society is of course incredible sti4l once we climb that barrier to our credulity the fun becomes very entertaining the troubles of wease the impostor are amusing and occasionally pathetic in spite of a certain proportion of scoundrelism he is not altogether a rogue and his career is quite satisfactory and melodramatic all ends well tommy the real sir theodore champ marries the girl he loves who turns out to be lady penelope emberssuch is the delightful way of the experienced novelist and tommys landlady happens to evolve into the long lost wife of the false sir theodcre the prime villain stiffidge meets with the correctly dreadful death what more can we say save that it is all very unreal very entertaining and very annoyingas we know that mr pugh could do really fine work if he cared to try,northamerica
  playing with fire by amelia e barr appleton 6s mr winston churchills novel 4 the inside of the cup has roused many echoes mrs bar treats the same subject in a much less detailed manner she has pictured the stern calvinistic spirit of a glasgow minister of half a century ago and has attempted to portray his struggle with his conscience and his estrangement from his family when doubt creeps in the result is not altogether successful but the calvinistic atmosphere is delicately caught we doubt whether the author intended her wellread minister to make the mistake of mentioning mark tapley as a character in 4 nicholas nickleby,northamerica
  the petrie estate by helen d brown osgood mcllvaine  co this is a fairly commonplace story about a lost will which is eventually discovered without any evil consequences to the heroine who loses the property only to gain the hero who acquires it the heroine deserves her wealth as she employs it in improving the slums of new york on the most approved cos principles and what is more remarkable in a novel she does not lose her charm by so doing it is a short story but even so there are several irrelevant characters who might well be spared the chief merit of the bookwhich comes rather as a surprise at the end as the story is throughout told in a somewhat dull unemotional style is a really excellent love scene the author seems distinctly to realise the immensity of true love and quite rises to the occasion 44 there seemed all at once no necessity about anything they were suddenly in possession of all time or rather they were transferred to new space where time was not duty was not words were not this is truly and excellently expressed,northamerica
  1 marietta a maid of venice new novels by f marion crawford macmillan  co here is a story of italy and italy in full renaissance which offends neither by sentimental maundering nor by affected diction nor by leering  naturalismnot a hint of  the erotic the neurotic or the tommyroticjust a healthy straightforward romance of the old school with plenty of adventure and ending as it should told in good english without any straining after phrases in a word the kind of thing that one reads without any desire to kick any one outside the story and not too many people in it and lays down feeling all the more cheerful for having read it no doubt it may be said that one has met most of the characters before  the choleric upright father the adorable quickwitted daughter who loves and is loved by the youth of station below her own the surly kindhearted old servant and so on but after all wholesome foods are not very various so far as the raw material is concerned and there is good authority for holding that it s the seasoning as does it in the present case the seasoning may be taken to be represented by the circumstances of venetian life at or near the end of the fifteenth century and more especially those of the glassblowing business of that time the story is indeed based on a recorded incident of those days and the principal personages actually lived and moved a fact which the author reveals in a note placed perhaps wisely at the end of the book some readers might be apt to be deterred by knowing that the course of events was all settled four hundred years ago still more we suspect will be a little disappointed that so little comes of the secret society in which zorzi finds himself involuntarily enrolled early in the story a venetian secret society they may think is rather a powerful engine to employ for the deliverance from an unjust accusation of a mere glassblowers assistant hero though he be and indeed it seems to have existed for no other practical purpose so that its introduction raises hopes that are not gratified having carped thus much let us say that the scene in which marietta half coerces half coaxes her father into cancelling her betrothal to her patrician intended is as charming a piece of comedy as we have often read,northamerica

attachment   on returning to the inn i learned the whole story of the deceased it was a simple one and such as has often been told she had been the beauty and pride of tiie village her father had once been an opulent farmer but was reduced in circumstances this was an only child and brought up entirely at home in the simplicity of rural life she had been the pupil of the village pastor the favourite lamb of his little flock the good man watched over her education with paternal care it was limited and suitable to the sphere in which she was to move  for he only sought to make her an ornament to her station in life not to raise her above it the tenderness and indulgence of ker parents and the exemption fruin all ordinary occupations had fostered a natural grace and delicacy of character that accorded with the fragile loveliness of her form she appeared like some tender plant ot the garden blooming accidentally amid the hardier natives of the iields   the superiority of her charms was felt and acknowledge by her companions but without envy for it was surpassed by the unassuming gentleness and w inning kindness ot nei numiiers it might be truly said of her  4 u this is the prettiest lowborn lass that erer kan on the greensward  not li ing she does or seem but smacks of something locater than herself too noble for this place   the village was one of those sequestered spots which sujj retain some vestiges of old enrrlnh customs it had its rur festivals and holiday pastimes and still kept up some tami observance of the once popular rites of may t hese inae j had

pageant but above all with the dawning loveliness ofthe queen of may it was the village favourite who was crowned with flowers and blushing and smiling in ll the beautiful confusion of girlish diffidence and delight the artlessness of rural habits enabled him readily to make her acquaintance he gradually won his way into her intimacy aid paid his court to her in that unthinking way in which voun officers are too apt to trifle with rustic simplicity 4 there wa nothing in his advances to startle or alarm he aever even talked of love  but there are modes of making it more eloquent than language and which convey it subtilely id irresistibly to the heart the beam of the eye the tone f the voice the thousand tendernesses which emanate from t very word and look and actionthese form the

naturally delicate and poetical and now first awakened to a keen perception of the beautiful and grand ofthe sordid distinctions of rank and fortune she thought nothing it was the difference of

bosom had entertained resentment against her lover it was extinguished she was incapable of angry passions and in a moment of saddened tenderness she penned him a farewell letter it was couched in the simplest language but touching from its very simplicity she told him that she was dying and did not conceal from him that his conduct was the cause she even depicted the sufferings which she had experienced  but concluded with saying that she could not die in peace until she had sent him her forgiveness and her blessing  bv degrees her strength declined and she could no longer leave the cottage she could only totter to the window where propped up in her chair it was her enjoyment to sit all day and look out upon the landscape still she uttered no complaint nor imparted to any one the

blossom of their hopes still flattering themselves that it might again revive to freshness and that the bright unearthly bloom which sometimes flushed her cheek might be the promise of returning

crayon gent ebiefo of j2efo 33ooi svo pp 354 london 1820 the author of tiie  sketch book had no need to deprecate the censure of the critics or to solicit from them  that courtesy and candour which a stranger has some right to claim who presents himself at the threshold of a hospitable mansion since the consciousness of his own talents and the approbation his work met with while publishing in numbers in america must have made him confident of ensuring public approbation among the seventeen sketches of which this work consists there is one on  english writers on america in which the author complains ofthe illiberality with which we treat american literature and which he attributes to the following causes  it has also been the peculiar lot of our country to be visited by the worst kind of english travellers while men of philosophical spirit and cultivated minds have been envoys from england to ransack the poles to penetrate the deserts anl to study the manners and customs of barbarous nations with which she can have no permanent intercourse of profit or pleasure it has been left to the broken down tradesman the scheming adventurer the wandering mechanic the manchester and birmingham agent to be her oracles respecting america from such sources she is content to receive her information respecting a country in a singular state of mora and physical development a country in which one of the greatest political experiments in the history of the world is now performing and which presents the most profound and niomentotis studies to the statesman and the philosopher aw   meu

diffused blessings je author assures us that the general impression in england that the people of the united states are inimical to the parent state is so far from being true that collectively speaking the prepossessions of the people are strongly in favour of england  indeed at one time they amounted in many parts of the union to an absurd decree of bigotry the bare name of englishman was a passport to the confidence and hospitality of every family and too often gave a transient currency to the worthless and the ungrateful throughout the country there was something of enthusiasm connected with the idea of england we looked to it w ith a hallowed feeling of tenderness and veneration as the land of our forefathersthe august repository of the monuments and antiquities of our racethe birthplace and mausoleum of the sages and heroes of our paternal history after our own country there was none in whose glory we more delightednore whose good opinion we were more anxious to possessnone towards which our hearts yearned with such throbbings of warm consanguinity even furing the late war whenever there was the least opportunity for kind feelings to spring forth it was the delight of the generous spirits of our country to show that in the midst of hostilities they still kept alive the sparks of future friendship  is all this to be at an end  is this golden band of kindred sympathies so rare between nations to be broken for ever perhaps it is for the bestit may dispel an illusion which might have kept us in mental vassalage interfered occasionally with our true interests and prevented the growth of proper national pride but it is hard to give up the kindred tie and there are feelings dearer than interestcloser to the heart than pridethat will still make us cast back a look of regret as we wander farther and farther from the paternal roof and lament the waywardness of the parent that would repel the affections of the child whatever the americans may be generally our author is certainly above those prejudices and is very anxious that the conduct he attributes to england in this respect should not be imitated bv his country men whom he warns in language so energetic and so highly honourable to his liberality that we cannot omit the passage  1 but above all let us not be influenced by any angry feelings so far as to shut our eyes to the perception ot wbat is really excellent and amiable in the english character we are a young people necessarily an imitative one and must take our examples and models in a great degree from the existing nations of europe there is no country more worthy of our study than england the spirit of her constitution is most analogous to ours the manners of her people their intellectual activitytheir freedom of opiniontheir habits of thinking on thoe subjects which concern the dearest interests and mot sacred charities of private life are all congenial to the american character and in fact are all intrinsically excellent for it is in the moral feeling of the people that the deep foundations of british prosperity are laid and however the superstructure may be timeworn or overrun by abuses there must be something solid in the basis admirable in thc materials and stable in the structure of aa edifice that so long has towered unshaken amidst the tempest of the world rut notwithstanding all that our author bas said and ably as he has pleaded thc cause of his countrymen we agree with a eotemporary in thinking that there are two american authors only whose genius lias reason to complain of british neglect and with a very great deal of reason both unquestionably may do so namely charles brockden brown and washington irvin mr brown who has been dead many years was a novel writer of considerable talents who has not been inaptly compared to godwin he was the author of wieland9  ormond  arthur mervyn and  edgar huntly works very popular on the other side of the atlantic and admired by all who have read them in england washington irving is the sole author of the sketch book a periodical work published at new  ork and from which the present volume has been formed under his immediate direction an earlier production of his which attracted much attention in thc united states but is scarcely known in europe was c a history of new york by diedrick knickerbocker a work which although of a local nature displays so much true genius that we hope our arcadian friend mr miller will follow up his publication of the sketch book by a reprint of this singular production of the same author the sketch book consists of powerful delineations of the incidents which more particularly attracted the notice of the author in a voyage to europe many of them have an immediate reference to england with the customs and peculiarities of which he seems most intimately acquainted the first sketch is the  voyage in which the author most powerfully portrays the feelings by which he was actuated at different periods from quitting his native shores until he stepped upon the land of his forefathers but felt that he was a stranger in that land the following extract from this sketch

  patience sparhawk and her times by gertrude atherton 65 lane try to conceive  the story of an african farm 0 without its passion for morality and you will get some idea of mrs athertons new book it is the novel of a clever woman of overflowing energy and burning interest in life but it is terribly crude and to european eyes terribly solemn with the aggressive solemnity of youth primarily it is a protest against the tame american novel and a claim that the people of the united states are very independent in ideals and conduct and very much themselves patience is a defiant portrait of a defiant woman to the mere reader she is a conceited badtempered and vulgar person a not unnatural product of a shocking bringing up but her creator proudly shows her with the manhood of new york at her feet paying her outrageously illbred compliments the refreshing thing about patience is her strong belief in the sanitary influence of brains which have been rather underrated by heroines of her order in recent fiction mrs atherton we are sure is not her apologist she likes her just sodefiant rasping grasping flattery and powerperhaps wishes she were worse but seeing she is neither exemplary nor charming a reader who cares more for general human nature than for any temporary phase of the american woman will ask what is the good of her to him her career is spasmodically interesting the society scenes we cannot accept as true to life but her experience among the temperance women and the newspaper men are at least very lively as a story however we own our real interest was first roused when bourke on his engine was racing the new york express with the confession which was to save patience from a criminals death in the electrical chair altogether it is a book that interests us more in its writer than in itself all the characters who have anything to say talk essays by this means mrs atherton has got rid of much matter weighing on her mind and so presumably she will move along more swimmingly next time  fiction patience sparhawk and her times by n gertrude atherton john lane dubing these two or three years certain social sketches published in vanity fair over the signature of mrs atherton have indicated the settlement in our midst of an american writer of much promise now comes the novel it cannot be denied that upon the whole the promise is fulfilled in one of its many aspects the book invites and indeed deserves ridicule it is ridiculous as the embodiment of mrs athertons philosophical proposition about the women of america these dames and damsels may really be struggling to be free from the conventions which keep society decent and girlhood charming but we cannot believe that they will ever as a class settle down into the humourless hetairism in which practically all the characters of this book spend the mid period of the romance mrs athertons philosophy of the american woman need not however trouble us long it springs from an excess of zeal and may be overlooked the story itself is fresh and arresting patience sparhawk is at school when we make her acquaintance her father is dead and her mother is given to drink and wantoning and young as she is patience who has a sensitive soul is bitterly at issue with the world dreary this state of affairs undoubtedly is but it is treated with extraordinary skill so keenly sympathetic is mrs athertons study of the strange rural life in america that we follow her for many chapters with a very unusual interest her perceptions are acute and her reflections are extraordinarily well phrased nor does the work fall off when having tried to kill her mother patience leaves home for the great city there she is taken charge of by two maiden relations whose evangelical activities george eliot herself could scarce have depicted with finer art meanwhile patience has been developing her spanish nature has blossomed into a critical reticent hauteur and she has become beautiful there ends mrs athertons essay in real literature the lovemaking and the wedlocks which follow will not bear examination the book reveals an unusual perspicacity as regards women but mrs athertons men are not good with the exception of the two editors under whose joint auspices patience becomes a  newspaper woman the male characters in the book are unnatural finally being suspected of having poisoned her husband patience is condemned to death thereupon the novelist finds her proper pace again and the pace is rapid times without record the same situation has been made use of by sensational writers but we should be surprised to learn that it has ever been more effectively treated than it is in this novel the narrative flies before our eyes as fast as the special ttain which is bearing the reprieve and a new lover to the gaol in which the heroine is about to be  electrocuted it is not literature of a high kind  but such ns it is it is brilliant,northamerica
  the house of mirth airs wharton is essentially a moralist albeit with the whole modern resolve not to declare herself  a gift from the grave  remains her highest most complete and most commanding work because in a memorable passage she set her sail to a natural wind moral passion swept through the world of that bookdirect grief emotion close to the fact of life love indignation remorse dishonour and honour all the storms of breasts complex civilised but incorrupt in  the house of mirth  we have to read of the fortunes of a woman full of desires and of selflove but void of virtue of passion and of intellect and round about her are only lovers of their own ease and supremacy claimants to the right of a social contemptuousness towards other less fortunate egotists as the salt of life and graspers of riches as its sweetness to observe this horde without obvious irritation is a work demanding selfcontrol and mirs wharton watches them from the sequestered bower of her fine art taking wide views keeping her own counsel it seems strange to say of a novelist who has filled five hundred pares with chosen words that she keeps her own counsel but it is none the less obviously true of the writer of these five hundred remarkable pages the keeping of her own counsel is one of the feats of her work is it indeed worth doing so well or rather is not the other featthat of the unlocking of a noble mindworth doing in much of her writing we were admitted to recognise her noble mind we are reluctant to forego an intimacy that we valued and when mirs wharton goes about to keep her own counsel she does it as she does everything extraordinarily well thackeray intended to keep his owvn counsel as a sentimentalist but he did not do it well he assigned the sentiment to certain charactersto women to laura pendennis foremostand pretended to be a moderately cynical man looking on with a smile he took for himself as it were the part of arthur pendennis whereas he was laura at heart and thus easily persuaded the duller readers in their multitude during two generations that he was of a cynical turn but the author of  the house of mirth  does not reveal herself even dramatically she is the greatest thing that a writer of fiction can bea moralist but there is no person in this story to bear the charge of the character and in this extremity of reserve lurks the one fault of art in the bookthat is the indefiniteness of the  better part  which seldom has to offer to the selfloving and moneyloving heroine in the character of this young new york woman about whom the whole history is written we recognise two likenesses she is partly gwendolen harleth and partly hedda gabler vet with something modern in the place of gwendolens thirst after righteousness and something intelligible in the place of heddas vice and heddas despair both resemblances therefore are slight now in her slight likeness to gwendolen harleth she should have a kind of external conscience in the form of a mana man at least esteemed at least admirable but the man in whom the role is just suggested in  the house of mirth is very little estimable he has born a part in the  cold obstruction  of the intrigues of man and woman in the world he lives ina squalid past we are compelled to see because of the manner of woman who had been his random mistres and the better part he shows the heroine halfheartedly as a way out of her pursuit of luxury is vague if it wvere definite we are sure it would be inadequate and smrs wvharton ably leaves it in a little cloud we choose however to pause where she passes and to ask a closer question all the answer we get is a tender of liberty and obviously liberty is what the unfortunate egoist the woman of the new york  world  needs urgently and all but desperatelv but in what liberty does the apostle of this vague apostclate himself abide we see him in the beloved luxury in which all the persons of the book roll themselves with revolting joy we cannot imagine lawrence seldom following liberty into a hard or a useful or a wild or a sacramental life ihe sets open or rather ajar to the woman who inclines to love him a door into a better world too dubious for faith a better world open to nothing but a very justifiable suspicion and where there is no definite  the house of mirth by edith wharton 6s macmillan and co place to go to or object in setting out she does not go she is less to blame than mrs wharton we find her at the beginning poor very lovelv member f the innerthe most contemptuoussocial world of new york in full

of an overdose of morphia she does same deeply dishonourable things on her way plays a part in a yachting menage to which the elizabethans would give a plain name is refused in marriage by an exceedingly vulgar jew to whom she offers herself having misunderstood his addresses and vet sees him later as a friend is betrayed and slandered before her world by one woman helped with molle good

sequestered moralist supplies her with a fall  in her past it is the mode this year next vear in a decade of years it will not be the mcde so to hide a heart of emotion and of dignity meanwvhile it deprives us of the finest grace of mrs wvhartons geniusher imagery when she wrote of moral passions and ideals she used a splendid imagerv in  the house of mirth  it is cnly towards the close sphere tragedy darkens and the writer permits herself to show she feels that one or two admirable images prove to us hosv rich is the genius so long secluded alice nieynell  new novels the bouse of mirth by edith wharton macmillan  co to describe in a few words suoh a novel as mrs whartons is not easy thero is a great deal in it and it differs from her others society as it is in new york and the various degrees of its smartness form the principal theme of the book but it is particularly concerned with the fortunes of a beautiful girl suffering from want of dollars the malady mo9t difficult to cure in such a milieu the girl is more attractive than her surroundings good work is shown in her characterization and in her external circumstances and there is more in the picture of the mixed condition of her emotions and morals her unfortunate upbringing has given her small chance of rising above a circle where luxury and pleasure dominate yet there are in her indestructible germs of nobler impulses it is a pitiful story told with restraint and insight and not a little subtlety  the house of mirth by edith wharton macmillan 6s  mirth mr spectator once observed  is like a flash of lightning that breaks through a gloom of clouds and glitters for a moment mrs whartons novel is concerned with a girl moving in  select circles in new york to whom mirth is essential lily bart is beautiful honourable and brilliant but she is also poorvery poorand her love of luxury is even greater than her craving for the society of the  best people and an environment which shall make for gaiety and

  cecilia a story of modem rome by francis marion crawford macmillan  co a new novel from the pen of mr crawford comes as a welcome change after a series of badly designed and ill  written stories he certainly conceives a definite history and delineates definite characters he both thinks and writes while all too many of our purveyors of current fiction seem to consider thinking and writing two of the things least essential in the preparation of a story in  cecilia mr crawford takes us once more into the roman society which he knows so well and which he has again and again deftly delineated here once more he uses in a fresh and effective fashion facts or fictions from the debatable borderland between the provinces of ascertained science and occult lore the heroine is in some mysterious way a reincarnation of the last of the vestal virgins and is capable of throwing herself into a kind of hypnotic trance in which she lives over again some of the thrilling moments which preceded the close of her sacred office stranger still the man whom she sees in the trance is also reincarnated in modern rome and sees in dreams that which she witnesses when hypnotized when the two meet for the first time in the flesh it is to be conscious that they have long known each other in the spirit and from this is subtly woven an entrancing tale of the beauty and tragedy of love unlike some of the fictionwriters who venture into the mysteries of the occult mr crawford never lets us lose touch with the actual so that we are impressed by the story as we are by the records of the salpetriere cecilia is in every way worthy of its authors reputation  cecilia a story of modern rome by f marion crawford macmillan 6s mr crawfords new story though its subtitle painfully recalls the two much discussed novels set in that city of which the public has recently heard so much has nothing in common either in manner or matter with this school of fiction  cecilia  is the story of two men and a girl and is destitute of all political and sermonising pretensions to a large extent it is a study of telepathy and selfhypnotism but though the unexplained is touched upon the atmosphere of the story remains simple and almost tranquil throughout cecilia an heiress and the man lamberti meet for the first time only to realise that they are already perfectly familiar with one another the girl has dreamed of him all her life and from that meeting each commences to dream of the other every nightthe same dreamand both awake to hear their doors close softly as if after someones departure though both invariably lock themselves in upon retiring to rest lamberti is a sailor a born fightingman who had seen much active service in remote parts of africa china and elsewhere upon the commencement of the dreams he not unnaturally consults a nerve specialist but is found completely sound in mind and body the girl meanwhile lias become engaged to his greatest friend the marriage is near before she realises that she is passionately in love with the man of her dreamsthe nan she kisses every night in a state of trance or self1 ypnotipm then there is trouble but in the end though lovers avhom fate has predestined apparently for one another are allowed to be happy the second man has of course to suffer in life unfortunately there is always someone who has to do that mr crawford handles his subject with all his usual ease and dexterity  cecilia  never rises to any great height of emotion or excitement but it is in some ways all though more comfortable reading for that the reader with leisure to dispose of goes on steadily from page to page without skipping incessantly to know the issue of each successive entanglement with a less placid treatment this would inevitably have resulted,northamerica
  an altar of earth by thymol monk pioneer series 2s w1 net heinemann a sacrifice such as this story commemorates might rouse sympathy in readers under certain conditions namely that the sacrificeof personal honour for the good of humanity should be made for a really adequate cause should be absolutely essential in order to gain the object in view and should be undergone by some one whose dignity and general steadiness of character are not open to doubt at least these conditions are necessary where the literary representation of such a sacrifice is concerned at its peril does literature depend on receiving from its most freeminded critics the more tolerant less logical judgement of freeminded critics of life now many readers will say the first condition is not fulfilled and all must do the same for the second though we agree that the heroisms of hysterical persons are heroic yet daphnes general behaviour and conversation are such as to make us half believe her sacrifice to be a mere freak and though those who read to the end would have been angry had the sacrifice been ever completed still it knocks the bottom out of the whole story to prepare you as early as p  1 for the probability that it will never be required at all there is much pretty writing in the book about pan and country things and some cleverness too but as a representation of life  an altar of earth  is essentially weak,northamerica

  heathcote of gangoil harry harry hcathcotc of gangoil a tale of australian bush lift by anthony trollope low and co this novel of mr trollopes possesses the double merit of being short and extremely interesting but ws should think lbe would have encountered some difficulty if he had tried to get it published under the auspices of an emigration agency it professes to give a faithful picture of the society of the queensland  bush and of the struggle for existence among the various members of that society which although limited is still sufficiently   ci a naynniqt1ie interests the five drin large to contain antagonistic interests the five principal elements that take an active part in mr trollopes story are squatters freeselectors hired workmen thieves and mosquitos of these the mosquitos are the only animated creatures that seem thoroughly to enjoy life next to them come the thieves whose policy it seems to be to squat on a small leasehold property and to make that a basis of operations for stealing the sheep and cattle of their neighbours the danger of detection and imprisonment or hanging is a certain drawback to the charms of this easy life but that is so slight in a thinly peopled country that the squatter whose notions of property are primitive and elementary as those of paleys pigeon might be ideally happy but for his rivals the mosquitos when however we ascend in the scale of queensland society we have a painful illustration of the cares of greatness and of the advantages for happiness possessed by those at the bottom of the ladder as mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,northamerica

  the myths of the north american indians redskin tales by louis spence frai illustrated george g harrap and co 7s 6d net a collection of stories told by north american indians is here presented mr spence does not inform us how he became possessed of them but one is inclined to think that they have been gathered by him from the books which appear in the bibliography at the end of the present volume these sources differ very much in their value as evidence s e they range from the uncritical histories and travels of writers like adair and the bartrams in the eighteenth century through the interminable works of bancroft and catlin in the next down to the modern and more scientific collections of brinton curtin and boas and the acta of the smithsonian institute and of the many transatlantic anthropological societies the tales are here brought together without references to their origin or mode of selection save that they are arranged under the names of the various tribes or nations such as algonquins iroquois sioux and pawnees the stories thus chosen do not give us a very high idea of the red indian imagination hardly any of them are myths in the sense in which max muller used the word although in the case of hiawatha to which mr spence devotes a page or two he follows mr horatio hale in declaring that the whole story has grown up by disease of language round the history ot a real chief whose name happened to signify  he who seeks the wampum belt most of them are totem tales plainly invented ex post facto to explain why different tribes families or individuals came to be called by the names of animals a very few rise a little above this level as in the socalled cherokee tale of the origin of medicine where the animals once the friends of mankind grow angry at being hunted for food and call down diverse diseases on man who is only saved by the plants overhearing the plot and agreeing that each of them shall furnish a remedy for one of the diseases named the great majority however are merely wondertales in which magic power is ascribed to man and the lower animals alike and which mainly differ from the fairytales of our infancy by their pointlessness and incoherence a fair instance of this is the iroquois story of the stone giantess who settled herself in the wigwam of a hunter so as to escape from her cruel husband after a time the stone giant came in search of her when the hunter by her instructions struck him first on the arms and then on the nape of the neck killing him when the time comes for the hunter to return to his village the stone giantess also returns to her own people with the remark that now she has nothing to fear one would feel greater interest in these stories if one could be convinced of their originality so far is this from being the case that many of them seem to owe a good deal to wellknown european asiatic or african sources the sioux story of the beloved son who cannot return from the submarine land of the shades because he has eaten of food there is too strongly reminiscent of persephone and the pomegranate seed for the change of sex and locality to throw us off the scent so too in another sioux tale the exalting of the rabbit into an animal of extreme intelligence and cunning seems to smack of the negro stories enshrined in uncle remus and another attributed to the same tribe of a horse who warns his master of his brotherinlaws plot against his life is quite as near to the egyptian tale of two brothers as that of joseph and potiphars wife which most biblical critics now assign to that source the swanmaidens whose feather dresses are stolen by the hero are found here as in the norse literature and the arabian nights as is the lohengrin legend of the magic bark drawn by swans some of these parallels seem to have struck mr spence himself as when he draws the readers attention to the harrying of hades read harrowing of hell and declares that the algonquin tale of the crowwoman and the wolf bears a striking resemblance to spensers una and the lion if the tales given in this book have any connecting or distinctive thread it is the belief which appears in most of them in a land above the sky inhabited by spirits or supernatural beings resembling men who take an interest not always benevolent in the affairs of their mortal counterparts here again one would like to know if there is any trace of such a belief existing before the visit of the christian missionaries mr spences book is prettily illustrated by coloured plates of considerable artistic merit and is equipped with an introduction in which he deals with the origin of the north american indians he is we fancy right in implying that man is not indigenous to the american continent but came there from asia by a landbridge now submerged his identification of the modern esquimaux first with the earliest inhabitants and then with the skraelings of the norse sagas is more open to question but may pass muster we can hardly agree with him however when he tells us ex cathedra and without authority quoted that the fetish is in short a mascota luckbringer and that the mythologies of the red man are infinitely more rich in creative read creation and deluge myths than those of any other race in the two hemispheres we wonder whether he has ever heard of the sumerian cosmogonies whence perhaps all later ones have sprung,northamerica
  they that took the sword by n stephenson a wellwritten story of the american civil war lincoln comes into it they were almost startled by the womanly gentleness of his face it had seemed so repellent the moment before the story begins on the thirtieth night of august 1862 miss amy golding sat at her window below stairs her grandfather with several of his friends sat at wine in the diningroom she heard them start a song it was the  star spangled banner lane 6s  they that took the sword by nathaniel stephenson lane tue struggle between the south and the north in america was a fratricidal one from the outset the result could be determined by impartial spectators and any story which deals with the combatants on either side or both has the drawback of being a foregone conclusion mr stephenson has drawn a pleasant and we hope an accurate picture of cincinnati before the civil war began if his portrayal be correct which we do not question then the city itself must have been transformed since mrs trollope went thither to retrieve the fortunes of her family with that object she opened a bazaar she left the city after losing all her money we should not have recalled these facts had not mr stephenson dwelled long and lovingly upon the perfections of society in cincinnati before the civil war the subject of the story is the simple one of a girl with a lover who is fighting in the northern army while her relations are on the side of the confederacy the clashing between love and duty is well rendered each side equalled the other in heroism but the result as we have said was clearly marked out hence no story founded on personal and family antagonism unless vivified by some such glamour as that scott cast over the 45 can hold the readers attention and comments upon the characters themselves such as mr stephenson makes in thackerays manner but without thackerays skill are not attractive,northamerica
  cache la poudre by herbert myrick kegan paul  co this curious production is described in a subtitle as  the romance of a tenderfoot in the days of custer it is illustrated profusely from paintings and photographs and is a rambling tale of adventurous life in the far west of america in days when lynchings and fights with indians were matters of everyday occurrence the absence of constructive method even of ordinary coherence in the story indicates an unaccustomed hand the book has however the merit of comparative fidelity to actual fact there is a lengthy appendix the frequent allusions to which in the text are rather damaging to the romantic interest of the tale the photographs are interesting and there is certainly material enough in the volume for half a dozen romances,northamerica

  th red rorer  tab  ttlk rkl kovkk bv the ai thou of  tin spy  the pilot  thc prairie c e s vols limo london lm2s avk must admit that in the present production of mr cooper we have been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the importance of possessing so interesting a legend to communicate   and such is also the name they give to his vessel because no mau who has put foot on board her has over come bael to say that she has a bettor or a worse  that is no honest mariner or lucky voyager the ship i of though size of a kings sloop they scv and of like equipments and form  but she ha miraculously escaped from the hands of many a gallant

thom that the hand of the lord was felt so powerfully on the deep and that though hover had enough to do to keep his own ship from foundering the acquaintance of my friend had a good view of both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest trader to keep off in order that though two vessels might not do one another damage by coming foul   he was a bold mariner that trader to go so nigh such n merciless rogue  1 warrant you lardon it was

in the manner and the very things 1 have named to you more than that ho took good note of the vessel that he might know her if chance or providence should over happen to throw her again into his way she was a long black ship lying low in the water like a snake in the grass with a desperate wicked look and altogether of dishonest dimensions then every body says that she appears to sail faster than the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy upon the motions of the ked rover who with a facility only to he met with in romance becomes acquainted with our hero anti is at once appointed to the first lieutenancy of the pirateship the descriptive portions of the work are without exception good and we quote the following picture of the cabin of the lied rover   the apartment in which our adventurer now found himself atrbrded no bad illustration of the character of its occupant in its form and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements  but in ils furniture anti equipments it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation the lamp which swung from the upper deck was of solid silver and though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity there was that in its shape and ornaments which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character massive candlesticks of the same precious metal and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation were on a venerable tible whose mahogany was glittering with the polish ol hail a century and whose gilded claws anti carved supporters bespoke au original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship a conch covered with cut velvet stood along the transom  while a divan of blue silk lay against the bulkhead oppoite inanifesin by its fashion its materials and its piles of pillows that even asia had been made to contribute to tue ease of its luxurious owner in addition to these prominent articles there were cut glass mirrors plate and even hangings each of which by something peculiar in il fashion or materials bespoke au origin iliiterent 1roai that of ils neighbour in short splendour and elegance seemed to have been mach more consulted than propriety or conformity in taste in the selection ol most of those articles which had been oddly enough made to contribute to the caprice or to cue comfort of their siiguia possessor  lu the midst of this medley of wealth rntl luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt is all in vain however the ship is on the point of sailing when most opportunely the captain breaks his leg and wilder is without loss of time nay on a live minutes intid uiatiou ol the tact installed in thu command the royal caroline so she is named sails from the bay whilst all the exertions of the new captain are employed to carry her out of the course of the rover isle fails of course  the pirate pursues him  a storm ensues the royal caroline is dismantled reduced to a total wreck and at length roes down while wilder and the ladies escape in the launch and are safely received on board

made a plunge like a dyirp whale  and raising its stern high into the air glided into the depths of thc sea like the leviathan seeking his secret places the motionless boat was lilted with the ship

through the same gaping whirlpool to the bottom then it rose rocking to the surface  and for a moment was tossed am whirled like a bubble circling in the eddies of a poul after which the ocean moaned and slept again  the moonbeams playing across its treacherous bosom sweetly and calm as the rays are seen to ipi iver on a lake that is embedded in sheltering mountains the plot now thickens  the rover encounters the british vessel to which wilder is attached goes on board in disguiseand discovers his treachery hut instead however of executing him as a traitor he dismisses him and his friends in the most polite and approved manner as soon as wilder gets on board he informs his commander of the real character of the rover a seafight ensues the british are beaten and the treacherous lieutenant is again in the power of the corsair isle is oh the point of immediate execution when the denouement ensues a number of singular discoveries are made in a moment and an amicable alrangement and au advantageous match are concocted on the spot for these particulars howex r we must refer our readers to the work itself which notwithstanding the few blemisho which are here mentioned is really

  the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn novels c by henry kingsley 3 vols macmillan  cothere is a strange family likeness pervading the novels of the two messrs kingsleycharles and henry both affectthe former may claim the honour of having inventedwhat is called  muscular christianity in both the ideal of goodness is intimately associated with a sound digestion strong nerves high spirits and a large development of the animal powers not only the mens sana but the anima pura must be lodged  in corpore sano for real pietywe refer chiefly though not entirely to the sterner sexto be dyspeptic is difficult to be  larmoyant would be impossible the characteristics are utterly incongruous charity indeed forbids them to lay down as a broad principle that no true christian can be subject to neuralgia or afraid of bronchitis or weak on his pins or less than four feet ten inches in stature or too feeble to fight the blacksmith and too timid to shoot a robber but the best that can be said for suchjfrail brethren is that appearances are strongly against them according to the kingsley theory the perfect christian should be recognizable if exhumed a thousand years hence by some theological cuvier of the thirtieth century by the size of his skeleton and the magnificent expansion of his os frontis living in our own day this species may be known chiefly by their vigorous vitality their endurance of fatigue the inextinguishable laughter with which they greet every crisis of suffering or adversity and the stalwart strength1 which upon adequate provocation they can impart to the extensor muscles of the forearm written upon these principles the romances of either kingsley are full of excitement and interest their heroes are apt to display all manner of feats of personal prowess and of course find innumerable opportunities for such performances the author of  geoffrey hamlyna younger brother we believe of the rector of eldertonnow makes his first appearance as the writer of an independent work hitherto his productions have been limited to a few u spirited  articles in frasers magazine describing the sporting capabilities of australia his present work relates chiefly to the same country with which mr h kingsley is evidently well acquainted and concerning which he has much that is at once novel and interesting to tell the family theory indeed prospers amazingly by emigration to a new country in our old and hotpressed society at home we are forced to confess that  muscular christianity  is somewhat out of place it is not altogether true and might occasionally be found inconvenient a muscular christian of the kingsley type would sometimes under contingencies that must now and then occur in england find himself entangled in rather disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by heury kings ley 3 vols macmillan and co mr henry kingsley follows with much vigour his brothers lead and iu the school of muscular christianity which his brother has founded he may prove better claim upon the rank of a head master than that of founders kin the author of geoffrey hamlyn not only talks about life in australis but knows it and as this field of exertion occupies a large place in the ethical system he is helping to develope bia australian experience is worth a doctorate to the new teacher there are four stalwart lovers of a wayward heroine who marries unwisely and at last finds herself an orphan with an infant at the breast her husband a transported coiner he was transported by the judge to a place where he became captain of a gang of bushrangers killed his own son snd wss hung most of the other persons of ths story are transported also by the author to australia there it may be that the compactness of the plot suffers a little from the full and fresh impression of the country that the author has to give lt is a defect not to be quarrelled with the sketches sro all free and lifelike here is for example a suggestion of the writers quality the story passes from the description of a great bush fire during drought to the tremendous thunderstorm that heralds rain i lay there on though hot black ground my head felt like a block of atone and my neck waa stiff so that

good grass again we ought to start and get some store cattle mr henry kingsley hints sn intention to write more the public will be glad to read more for his power evidently is not of a kind to be exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the artificial precincts of three volumes post 8vo no matter who or what the interlocutors may be mr henry kingsley however has written a book which the public will be more inclined to read than to criticize and we commend them to each other,northamerica
  little stories abou  women these  little stories of very distinguished workmanship are mainly concerned with the life of english society womennot seen on parade but in the moods of remniscence and sentiment that come when they are tired or suddenly released from tensionand wih popular italian luttle stories about women by george fleming 3s 6i grant richards life of which the writer has an unusually close knowledge the italian stories with their pithy use of the speech of peasant and gondolier give the keenest literary pleasure but the english ones will certainly make a more general appeal while in them george flemings gift of light and certain portraiture is perhaps seen at its beat in  by accident for instance we are presented to the heroine as she is passing out of life hardly a fact is told of the years that went before but we know her this irreproachable wife and mother and member of society bound nevertheless by the slightest of bonds to her responsibilitiesthe halfconscious irony in her relations to life always a puzzle to her solemn husband yet in whom sentiment could be and had been awakened in whom it assertn itself as the strongest reality at the last on a lower scale of difficulty not of skill are the two portraits in a woman with no nonsense about her of the illmated friends one accepting the worlds good things with impudent complacency the other on whom life levies heavy dues because she lacks the great gifts audacity and grace in  for better for worse and in  mees the latter a study of italian patriotism as seen through the ignorant but loving eyes of an english ladysmaidthere is the same lighthanded skill but i miss it in the more openly emotional  the next house  and  a contemporary of the italian stories  the prince of morocco craves first mention for its dating subject and its unexpectedness it is an imaginative guess at the history of portias swarthy suitor of that name george fleming accounts for him in northern italy in a poetical fantastical experiment which is only audacious not blasphemous of course for most excellent reasons it ought to be a failure but in one or two directions it confounds the rightminded critic for it revivifies a page of old venetian life and it is a delightful bit of imaginative writing in force and reality however it must give way before the exquisite tragicomedy of the beggar women in  for ten francs one of the two great successes of the book perhaps at venice cannot compete with that one in familiar human interest yet i venture to think the highwater mark of the book is reached in the narrative of the old gondolier once employed in his youth by an austrian officer to row two prisoners to their death at the back of san georgio in most hands it would have been a mere picturesque description here it is a little drama concentrating into its few pages the venetian struggle gathering up the profound mystery of the venetian night giving too by the way the gondolier philosophers excellent summary for and against the powers that were and the powers that be  men walked the streets of venice with the cold fear of the white prisons and the hot fear of the white army lying heavy upon their mouths so that no man spoke of it at allno not even to his brother and when there was talk that man vanished   now we are all italians they tell me   we are all alike now 1 and maso and you and the first threefoothigh assassin of a sard   that is because we have a governmer t nowa government and an army and a law and a1l italy is free and the black dogs of priests can frighten no one any more except the women and the wine is wvatered and a mans polenta costs like roast chicken   we are free sari how should i know  but what i say is that those with the full pockets get the last word those were our masters and these are our masters paroni i e poi paroni and the master is the man who has the last word surely one may expect a mmasure of popularity for stories whose subtle art is condoned by the general human interest of their tubjects a m  little stories aboun women by georwo fleming grant richards it is from a dingy palette that these impressions are spread they are keyed don to the patience of the most morose pessimism but they are truth that side of it and life at its most lamentable in the career of human beings there arrives a moment when the soul comes to the surface and the careful watcher may discern in the meagre spectre the never realised notion after which its creator fashioned it george fleming is this careful watcher she knows how to qapture the moment she is cunning to unveil it her method reminds one more than a little of m marcel prevost i select a contemporary it is the reverie of a woman upon what had not passed six y ears before upon the day when by way of a final indulgence of an unlawful passion she had given her lover a fareweeu rendezvous that meeting never took place of  they had been prevented by the commonest the most obvious of accidents it had simply rained all day long she had so vehemently persuaded herself that the very completeness of the sacrificethe manner in which she sent him away for evercould propitiate fate cheat justice turn this last poor selfindulgence into a mere question of compensation for the pain they suffered and then it had rained all day we look into the womans mind while the fictitious details of that sterile day stream through it just as by a more familiar device for securing the perspective of which mr harland writes as so effective an element in the successful treatment of the short story we have been shown the intimate leaves of the carnst or of familiar correspondence she arrives at the station for stonehenge so runs the story which she tells herself for the hundredth time and finds him awaiting her in the lumbering hired carriage he was by her side  his love was there  and in an instant a feeling of absolute satisfaction the rest the contentment of a natural completion filled all her heart and being stilled it filled it rising rising like water in a lock that trick by the way of doubling a word either to give a sustained effect or for intensity is throughout the volume overindulged they send the carriage away and lunch  and then    she told him the whole story rapidly impetuously without stopping to pick words as if some secret barrier between their minds were for the first time broken  i was twentytwo nearly twentythree and there were so many of us at home i was so pleased not to wait to be the first of all to marry  i liked all the things he gave me roger nownowat the present momenti like having those things still  but this was not all that held her when she was most nearly softened recurred the knowledge that   sometime somewhere there would come a certain day a certain hour when he ceased sic to care for her as he cared now  and nothing could prevent itnothing it was not even his fault  as they neared the terminus he made a laqt appeal and as he knelt   she laid her other hand upon his bowed head what was there left to say  she loved this man with all the force of which she was capable but she had grown up in a society which discourages sentiment and holds many material satisfactions for those who are successful after its own fashion her husband fusses in upon the finish of the vision the impression is of a little nature fenced into the strait path of social sanction by no principle of religion or of ethics but by its essential defects of courage and confidence subject therefore to every temptation empty of all satisfactiona strong and clear impression caught at the moment when the woman knew herself of the eleven other storiesand none of them falls below a high standard a woman with no nonsense about her

  macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,northamerica
  the sentimental vikings by r v risley john lane we have nothing but welcome for translations from celtic or scandinavian saga they bring a fresh and vital stimulus into letters new fire from heaven but of the deliberate imitation or adaptation of such models which is so favourite a modern archaism we are not quite so sure even the genius of william morris never induced us to thoroughly enjoy his prose romances or to feel that the epithet  wardourstreet  was altogether undeserved and if even mr morris then much more mr risley must come under the condemnation his viking tales are put in the mouth of a contemporary minstrel who tells in days of etd the fortunes of his lord in war and wooing there is a good deal of bloodshed and also a good doa of ale but if you like the convention then you should like mr risleys application of it he has the gift of picturesque and poetic narrative and has happily caught the vague outlines and the overhanging melancholy of old norse romance of the story of the oarcaptain he says the story is rough like the natures of men and full of storm of nature and sea as if a fury had run down the pages but there are soft threads in its rough woofi tell it just as though oarcaptain told it the quotation may perhaps serve to explain the title,northamerica
  resolved to be rich by edward h cooper duckworth  co there is an obvious difficulty in reconciling the two themes of which this story is composed both subjects are well handled but it is hard to see why they should be associated a group of persons living in north staffordshire and some swindling companymongers who plunder those who wish to be rich are vividly described but then a marchioness and her love affairs are unnecessarily dragged in and the author is hard put to it to impart cohesion to the subjects he introduces there was a brilliant marchioness in one of mr coopers earlier novels and her story was well worth narrating  but the lady who figures in the book now under notice is neither attractive nor clearly delineated there are clever passages and there are clever observations but in our view the book is not nearly so good as mr cooper has given his readers reason to expect of him  resolved to be eich by edward h cooper this novel by the author of mr blake of newmarket is well described by its title and the moral of the story is unobtrusively patent on every pageif we may put it so thus  their love of money becomes gradually absorbed into a passion for moneygetting which is not only the most unhappy disease upon earth but nearly always brings its victims into difficulties and thence occasionally into gaol for the simple reason that there is a limit to the amount of money which you can get honestly at the end of the story there is a liberal distribution of sentences of penal servitude duckworth  co 6s,northamerica

  senator north probably a quite new contingenttwvill be drawn into mrs athertons large circle of admirers by her latest book those who may have been alienated by her occasional audacities defiances even by her exuberant vivacity will re consider their judgments in  senator north there are audacities but there is a steadier power a greater sobriety than any of the earlier work gave promise of and the restraint has not tended to dulness the book is wellmade energetic and fresh and to our mind   senator north by gertrude atherton 6s lane shows a firmer grip of realiies than any of its predecessors there is abundance of novelty too in it a political novel it gives us glimpses of washington and senatorial society comfortably upsetting to the preconceived notions of most of us written during or just after the war fever it is courageously outspoken on the unpopular side and then its hero is a passionate lover at sixty years of age these novelties are treated too in a capable fashion we may have read bryce and the american newspapers and our own at the time of a presidential election and yet mrs atherton has something to startle us with the corrudtion of the den thrums from photo by valentine and sons dundee the wooded ravine called the den is in thrums rather on its western edge but it is so craftily hidden away that when within a stones throw you may give up the search for it it is ao so deep that larks rise from the bottom anl carol overhead thinking themselves high in the heavens before they are on a level with nether drumleys farmland in shape it is almost a semicircle but its size depends on you and the maid sentimental tommy political life is rather more doubtful after we have met senator north and the stability of the republic is not quite so certain as we had taken for granted hamiltons ghost must rouse a new train of thought in many minds perhaps mrs ahertons compatriots have forgiven her by this time for her outspoken condemnation of the war with spain but she has to count with readers on this side for she lashes a very common sentiment of the day when she laughs at the idea of wvar any kind of war being justifiable for the sake of the health of the aggressive nation but of course it is the lovestory that will attract most and rightly too for in spite of the washingtonian setting and the talk of votes and debates and wvar it is not a very political novel after all the heroine is quite specially unpolitical though she haunts the ladies gallery and keeps a political salon she took to politics as many take to philanthropy or

interest because she falls in love with a senator her lovestory is not very romantic or very heroic or very charming it is all too much arranged it follows too closely the lines of her selfinterest she wears innumerable beautiful toilettes but otherwise betty is a decidedly commonplace young person like too many of mrs athertons heroines she would be of no use at all for purposes of romance if she were not very rich but senator north makes an impressive hero for all his sixty years the only fault we have to find with him is his too elderly manner the tones of the benevolent grandfather are a little too audible but when he sinks these we own him to be a courtly and a fascinating loveroriginal too for his manner of keeping faith with his living invalid wife while calculating future chances of marriage with betty rouses our interest even our admiration the vitality of the man is astounding while combatting almost alone the war passions of a nation he has the spare force to be a lover and when the girl apparently deserts him lest her feeling for him should carry ler to unconventional lengthsfor a much younger man this gallant of sixty never doubts of his power but rests quiet till she comes back again he is a bold invention senator north and boldness has bred success it would have been better that the secondary story of jack emery and harriet had been omitted no european

  the corner in coffee by cyrus townsend brady putnams sons we gather from his own prefatory statements that the author enjoys a considerable vogue in the united states we should not be surprised if he gained one of a sort in england but it will never be a literary vogue in a very conceited preface dated brooklyn new york christmas eve 1903 he displays his methods as a concocter of fiction with elaborate and indecent candour they are methods which have nothing to do with the production of literature and do not commend themselves to our taste the story seems to have been largely derived from the late frank norriss  the pit and is concerned entirely with wall street speculation its good characters are kindly and incredibly vulgar its bad characters are dishonest and unbelievably caddish its sentiment is that of the christmas card its crises those of surreyside melodrama the authors use of language is not adequate he introduces the son of an english peer and makes him talk in this style  now you re a rippin girl ye know and i like you awfully well really i do he drawled most americans seem to think it is rather a jolly thing to be a lordor a lady i meananderthat sort of thing dont you know and iiwant you awfullypon honour i do there is much of this sort in the book which we cannot commend,northamerica

  the 3ookmans cable a son of thie middle border by hamlin garland 7s 6d john lane mr ilamlin garland one of the truest and strongest of western novelists has spent nearly a year in england and revelled in the fresh understanding it has given him of british nature and british problems those of us who know his books her mountain lover and the restare well aware of his sincerity of touch in writing and the effective humour he can put into the clash of character and type few uptodate western writers possess such real affinity with the old world and this gives him spiritual kinship with men of the past like longfellow lowell and howellsmen who began by absorbing the best that america and her universities could give and then completed their development by acquiring the best they could find in the travel and literature of europe it is one of the highest ambitions surely for an observer and interpreter to strengthen the bridge of sympathy that has for so long stretched across the atlantic and has been for ever hallowed by joint service in the war mr garland is destined to be one of these and we are glad of this biograph of a family to show what like of men he springs from there is something of heroism in the drift of his father westward and ever westward in search of the unfailing crop and the kindly season but it melts to pathos when the author has to follow westward and woo the old and disillusioned farmer back to the haunts of his boyhood and persuade him that the west has been a cruel lure social conditions especially after the civil war time were harsh and inclement but the native beauty of character and custom the oldfashioned pieties and traditions blend everything together into a texture of patience and content the closing scenes where the kinsmen come together at a thanksgiving feast are like a perfect sunset of human life,northamerica
  lin mclean by owen wister owen wister is the new american novelist of the cattle ranch and lin mclean is his hero lin is a cowpuncher independent fearless humorous resourceful truthful and like most other persons in this virile gusty book utterly lawless and richly idiomatic in his talk the episodes are stirring and wild and sometimes luridly powerful pistol shots are not much less frequent than commas harper  brothers 278 pp 6s  lin mclean by owen wister harper  brothersmr wister gives some very lively pictures of life in wyoming when it was a territory with a future instead of a state with a past the good old days of which he speaks seem to have grown old rather quickly they were the days of railroads but before the days of diningcars the talk of the people was extremely racy and one would say that modern idiom can hardly have improved upon it whether mr wister is historically exact or not matters little however his incisive style fixes ones attention and town and country man and beast and woman too are all set before one as clearly as in a photograph the story is not so precise it is presented as a series of episodes and possibly the chapters were published separately as one finds in them a certain amount of recapitulation  but this may be only for the convenience of tihort memories mr wisters reputation in america is considerable and it seems well deserved,northamerica
  the choir invisible by james lane allen se macmillan  co this is a novel of considerable charm the historic sense is strong in mr allen who reproduces the kentucky of 1795 with many characteristic touches of life and manners the actors too in his quiet drama are not wanting in interest kitty the wayward in view of her rejected lovers later career we had almost added the wisethe blacksmith and the parson are no less attractive though lightly sketched than the fuller study of the cultivated and hardworking gentlewoman mrs falconer john gray the hero of the story is good too with his gift of high seriousness and his rejection by kitty is very proper and satisfactory but his later failure to secure his real love by waiting seems unnatural and inconsistent with his steady uncompromising character most of the writing is excellent and full of effective touches if anything mr allon is a little too fond of the grand style which however he manages very well there is a delicate literary flavour about many of his images  sometimes they seem too directly reminiscent as when he says it is the woman who bursts the whole grape of sorrow against the irrepressible palate to  flirt a person  sounds a little odd to an english ear and suggests though idiom of the old lady who could not go to church because  there was a party as sneered her boots  the choir invisible by james lane allen 6s macmillhu it is possible that mr line allens popularity may not be so wide in england as it has grown to be in his own country but the excellence of his work must secure him many readers among us though our popular taste of the more cultivated kind is very different from popular taste in america here we are just a little ashamed or a little impatient of the open display of earnest feeling in a novel we like it involved in the characters implied in the course of events there are no such superior airs put on by cultivated american readers who are more patient of sentiment of explanation of the disburdening of the heart in  the choir invisible mr allen disburdens himself with great simplicity revealing a very sympathetic and sensitive nature lovers of historical fiction will find local colour and reference studiously and artistically attended to in this story of revolutionary america the scene of which is laid in kentucky at the end of the last century but the main interest is not the revival of old times but a lovestory which might be of today or any day a story which reminds one very pleasantly of harry esmond and lady castlewoad and not merely because the heroine of the choir invisible is a virginian we are reminded too of oliver wendell holmes by the temper of the reflections and the fact that we recall worthy names without irritation or scornful coaiparison while reading mr allen proves his work to be not of the common order  new novels ahe choir invi8iblk by james lane allen macmillan  co heralded by trumpets mr james lane allens new novel comes to us from america i have no hesitation in saying that the choir invisible is a book to read and a book to keep after reading mr allens gifts are manya style pellucid and picturesque a vivid and disciplined power of characterization and an intimate knowledge of a striking epoch and an alluring country he transports us to kentucky in the year 1795 the plot is not novel mr allen lays bare no sore he develops no problem it is just the story of a man who loved an attractive woman who was unworthy intertwined with the history of another who was pure gold that is all but so magical is the wilderness environment so fresh the characters so buoyant the life they lead so companionable so well balanced and so touched with humanity the authors personality that i hereby send him greeting and thanks for a brave book mr allen is not so well known in this country as in the united states but the choir invisibls will remedy that he has already written several novels including summer in arcady and a kentucky cardinal i have not read either of those booksin fact here is a frank confession before i began upon the choir invisible i had not read one line of mr allens writings and knew him only through appreciations in the american press but it is clear he is a man who has worked long and diligently at his art and that while he was chastening and controlling a manner his matter was increasing in volume and quality what would he make of a modern story i wonder here he has as background a glorious and undiscovered country where the imagination is fired by mere descriptions of nature and by pen pictures of the looks and dress of pioneer men it is all so fresh so new so right so sane so different from the tired life that encompasses us does not this stir the imagination  on

backwoodsmen swarthy lean tall wild and reckless of beanngtheir long rifles propped against the tree or held fondly across the knees the grey smoke of their pipes mingling with the grey of their jauntily worn raccoonskin caps the rifts of yellow sunlight blending with the yellow of their hunting shirts and tunics their knives and powderhorns fastened in the belts that girt in their gaunt waists the heroic youthful sinew of the old border folk one among them larger and handsomer than the others had pleased his fancy by donning more nearly the indian dress his breechclout was of dappled fawnskin his long thigh boots of thin deerhide were open at the hips leaving exposed the clear whiteness of his flesh below the knees they were ornamented by a scarlet fringe tipped with the hoofs of fawns and the spurs of the wild turkey and in his cap he wore intertwined wings of the hawk and the scarlet tanager or this description of the sidetracks through the primaeval forest  into this high road of the mastodon and the bison smaller pathways entered from each side as lesser watercourses run into a river the avenues of the roundhorned elk narrow yet broad enough for the tossing of his lordly antlers the track of the countless migrating shuffling bear the slender woodland alleys along which buck and doe and fawn had sought the springs or crept tenderly from their breeding coverts or fled like shadows in the race for life the devious wolfruns of the maddened packs as they had sprung to the kill the threadlike passages of the stealthy fox the tiny trickle of tie squirrel crubsing and recrossing without number and ever close beside all these unseen the graspath or the treepath of the cougar as i have said the plot of the story is of the slightest but apart altogether from its engaging setting the story is told extremely well and the objectivity of the characters will please the most fastidious amy falconer is a fascinating creation and the scene between her and john gray wherein this pretty minx does not explain why she cannot accompany him to theball is told with a delightful touch and in the vein of the finest comedy mr allen has a wide range and from passages of summerday philandering turns easily to such a vigorous chapter as that describing john grays fight with a cougar the dreaded panther of the backwoodsman which has for its kindred the royal tiger and the fatal leopard of the old world the episode is too long to quote in full but i must find room for the passage where the man first discovers the near the very near presence of the beast it is early

  tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a nobleman thus addresses i

which to usc a vulgar but expressive phrase was i complete hectic squasher these we suppose are among the peculiarities which have contributed to give wings to the fame of these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling their too obviously imperfect and defective education  talee of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beau clerk and henrietta maary beauclerk smith elder  co there is much that is silly some things which are absurd with a good deal that is clever in this volume we have seldom seen a work of more unequal merit there is a mixture of poetry and prose in the contents the prose is the best the poetry is poor in the extreme the merit of the work chiefly consists in the insight it gives into the foibles arid follies of the fashionable world the volume professes to be only the first of a series we doubt much whether its success will be such as to induce the fair authoresses to continue the series,northamerica
  a mirror for witches this is a skilful pouring of new wine into old bottles the author has chosen to write in the style of cotton mather edward fairfax or any other ardent seventeenth century believer in witchcraft and been inspired it would seem by the superb use made of such material by wilhelm meinhold in those beautiful and grand romances  the amber witch and  sidonia the sorceress in the plain narrative of some simple bigot the author has endeavoured to relate the experience of a girl who believes she is a witch and that her lover is a devil the lemon lover is becoming too common in fiction this has been a difficult feat and in places the author has broken her own formula the crude relations of her mouthpiece give way to studies of the girls feelings delivered in the fashion of today and in her anxiety to make the truth clear to the reader the modern and ancient interpretations of the story jostle one another so that part is an excellent  fake a very clever copy of a seventeenth century trial for witchcraft related by a contemporary and part the twentieth century minds idea of the sensations of the deluded witch herself these two aspects of the tale are skilfully blended but one feels that the author would have done far better to throw off all restraints and relate her tale directly from the modern angle the title page helps the impression of a sham or affectation and the woodcuts are neither here nor there neither seventeenth century downright materialism nor twentieth century fantasy but hoverwith an air of insincerity in a world of symbolism the little volume is attractively put together however and will be very effective to those who are not familiar with the sources from which it is taken and which have been very adroitly used but miss forbes is too good a writer for this sort of patchwork which is not very difficult  a mirror for witches by esther forbes 7s 6d c heinemann a n d t h e r e are passages of beauty terror and power in this book which seem to show she could write a fine story without any seventeenth century props the unrelieved sordid horror of the end is howvever depressing and unnecessary for all its grim theme the tale is too slight for such tragedy marjorie bowen  a mirror for witches by esther forbes heinemann 7s 6d readers of cotton mather or hawthorne may realise the horrors of witch trials in new england the author has recreated the spirit and detail of the period most remarkably in her study of the doom of a girl witch who became the pet of a seacaptain when doll bilby became  bilbys doll she had been snatched from the fire which burnt her mother and the memory of the scene grew in her till she believed incredible things about herself as a foundling forced on a family she was unpopular and when she became attractive her fate was sealed she feared and expected a messenger from the infernal king to whom her parents had promised her the narrow andsabominable religion of the time is perfectly reproduced and the whole story with its sad ironies for a more human and enlightened age is much more convincing than modern attempts to play with the theme of witches it shows the merits of restraint in art,northamerica

more exhilarating spirit amongst the london casuals from this skilful use of religion in sober earnest although a writer may profess in tike preface the most exalted views  and the most zealous desire for doing good v if we find the subject made agreeable and witty we must crave permission to doubt not the intention but the moral value of the work ffidendepths  professes to deal with the social evil but we fear takes much too onesided a view of the question for its cure we cannot deny that the work is well written and interesting  and sets the cure in a true light so far as seduction is concerned no one can regard this crime with too great horror the delicacy of the female sex once removed and it really seems as if nothing were left to it of that shrinking modesty or of that tender selfsacrificing affection so peculiar to women we hold with the writer of  hidden depths that no punishment can be too severe for the wilfui coldblooded seducer of innocence  bat then we require first to be satisfied of the innocence we cannot help feeling that very little account is made of the sin itself by the writer we are told with truth that the social evil is hardly held as a sin by the lower class supposing then that the offender held up to our execration in this novel instead of deserting his victim had pensioned her off before his marriage to another the novel could not have continued to choose what we hope is an extreme case for our inspection is not the best plan for preventing the fate of thousands of women which occurs from far more ordinary causes what are the statistics of seduction and of what the writer would connect with it suicide  take country villages as a test and a fair one in this case as the author describes his unfomunates as innocent country girls w have known an instance of a labourer wjfafe applied to his clergyman for help towwsib the maintenance of his illegitimate child alleging that it was the custom of the bjjfj teadeavosr to

such birth was not held sufficient cause again working in the fields is another fruitful source of contamination  the language and conduct of the married women being beyond measure vile we write it in sorrow  but the  innocent abodes of the poor with eight or ten persons of various ages sleeping in one bedroom do not yet exist vanity love of dress the desire of a life of excitement proved by female servants declining what they consider dull places the spread of light literature speaking slightingly of such connexions between rich and poorsuch as these are the real sources of the evil among such a class you will not find many who are goaded by excess of feeling or remorse to commit suicide the statistics of suicide prove that the most trifling causes such as sudden passion or illtemper will induce persons to destroy themselves what a terrible indifference to infanticide does the now celebrated case of the devonshire murderess discloseand by the way we have her photograph in hidden depths we now give a sketch of the story the heroine ernestine courtenay is engaged in the search for the sister of a girllois brook seduced by colonel courtenay her brother the girl lois brook commits suicide on being deserted and leaves a letter imploring the colonel to save her younger sister annie from a like melancholy end ernestine who is engaged to a mr lingard sets out with his permission on the search for annie brook who has been also seduced and cast off by her lover the tale shows us the social difficulties which meet ernestine in her mission she finds out the parents of the two girls  the father refuses to take back his child fearing the disgrace and loss of his place as lodgekeeper in a noblemans park  the mother gives a portrait of annie and a clue to the place where she is ernestine meets with a rebuff from lady carleton in asking permission for annies return to her fathers home she then goes to greyburgh university where her brother keginald is residing there she finds her brother dying and in a state of great mental trial from infidel views instilled into him by his college tutor two clergymen are introduced  the first is rector of the oarish in which annie brook is living a o dr granby is horrified at the notion of permitting a profligate to come near his house a good deal of wit is made out of his excuses for not seeking the lost he recommends ernestine to give up the search and to engage herself in real works of charity such as teaching an infant school  to clap their hands in unison or to imitate his daughter marie who leads c our little choir in term time when several of the collegians assist at our services and can appreciate our musical efforts we must here confess our surprise at any clergyman of a large parish represented as being so ludicrously indifferent to the cases of unfortunate girls of whose existence in visiting the poor he must continually be reminded and actually brought into contact with on their sick beds the other clergyman a mr thorold is represented as fully engaged in all the usual parish work of nightschools reformatories c as the book is published in scotlaud we hope that it is simply ignorance on the part of the author as to the conduct of the parish clergy who all more or less must meet with many cases connected with the social evil annie brook is at last found and persuaded to enter a reformatorythe discipline of which is too severe for her  she runs away but prefers rather to starve than to have recourse to the streets again she dies in the hospital but before her death recognises and forgives her first seducer lingard he of course is disclaimed for ever by ernestine who gives herself up to the work of recovering lost females we are treated to four deaths in the book three minutely described and the bodies properly laid out we find a great deal of poetical description as well as sentimental writing all the unfortunates are beautiful mis guided impulsive and affectionate we cannot think that the work although well written and interesting is quite in character with the very serious preface which informs us that the work is not one of fiction for  though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records much of the social evil is attributed teyoung men at the universityboys really of from sixteen to eighteen about whom the girls of the town congregate no doubt but innocent young women are not seduced out of the villages near as the author would indicate the language and turn of thought put into the mouths of the unfortunates are by no means true to nature as the author states in the work the sin itself is but lightly regarded among the poor they would therefore be very unlikely to speak or think even as here represented we cannot get over the feeling that the author more reprobates the desertion than the seduction of females the remarks about the overseverity of reformatories are good  but we cannot forget the overtenderness which lets loose ticketofleave men on the public the real fact is that if half the interest were displayed toward our poorest class before they become so interesting through sin and crime we should be fostering that sympathy between class and class which mr justice talfourd in his last charge declared to be so sadly wanting far more than by endeavouring to cure the evil after its spread the social evil will never be healed by novel writers however talented they may be the attack must not be made on human nature but on those evils which render that nature so weak and are thus the causes of the mischiefviz ignorance and the crowded dwellings of the poor and the poverty which makes them regard money as the sole good in life to be obtained at all hazards there are many landed proprietors even in mucliabtised dorset who are heartily working for the good of the poor by building cottages with more bedrooms the wages are also fixed at a higher rate by those gentlemen with the same objectthat of improving the moral condition of the labourers on their estates all this must be a work of time  and after all we cannot expect that the social evil can be ever eradicated until the whole world is in a far different state from what we now behold when there is no longer any more dishonesty or violence or deceit there will also be no more profligacy meanwhile if the efforts of philanthropists are directed not to exciting morbid sympathy towards the poor but to teaching men more selfrespect they will materially lessen the social evil  hidden depths tiim1 authoress of this very remarkable book writes with vehement earnestness taking for the motto of her work the axiom  verita4 ea major charitas  but we are sorry to say that her earnestness is in excess of her judgment and that what she takes for absolute truth is but a very limited part of a great and complex whole still though we are compelled for the truths sake to pass this apparently sweeping censure upon her work we are equally compelled to bear witness to the high intention with which she has laboured the extraordinary circumstance of a delicate pious and intellectuallygifted woman writingeven anonymouslyon the subject of the  social evil is in itself enough to bespeak respectful attention for her book but in addition the writer of  hidden depths is entitled to special consideration for the striking literary power she exhibits in the present volumes had she contented herself with writing an ordinary novel in which the sin of seduction was held up to the reprobation and scorn of all rightminded readers we are sure she would have deserved to be recognised as worthy of a conspicuous place in the ranks of contemporary english novelwriters she has chosen however to write with a purpose and we might almost say has courted failure for the admiration which hidden depths is well calculated to inspire so long as it is considered in the light of a work of fiction is turned to objection when the story with its narrow bounds and partial exhibition of facts has to be viewed as the exposition of a gigantic social disorderthe most saddening difficult not to say hopeless problem of civilised life 4 though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records in this sentence taken from the authoresss preface we detect the error which underlies the whole argument of her book what happens mostly in the case of those who act upon mere philanthropical impulse has happened in her case having become possessed of a few facts she has taken them as representing the whole truth of the subject on which they bear it is clearly to be inferred from her book that she believes seductionthat is to say the systematic ruin of perfectly innocent girls by heartless profligatesto be one of the chief causes of the vice in question but how utterly without foundation such a belief must be is known to every one who has ventured to inquire into the subject at all it is most probable that the writer of  hidden depths  has heard the story of the happy home the perfect innocence the advent of the betrayer the faill from virtue the abandonment and all the other incidents related by some reclaimed unfortunate the mistake she has made is in having given a too ready credence to a relation which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred is found upon searching inquiryr to be wholly or in great part untrue of the poor wretches who qualify themselves to take the distinctive title of unfortunates it is almost certain that not ten in a thousand adopt that miserable calling from the cause assigned by her we need not recapitulate the score of wellascertained causes and we will only say that they have been found enough to daunt the boldest seekers for a remedy the authoress of  hidden depths thinks she has only to take her bible in hand and the cure is found through the lips of her heroine she cries in answer to the objection that she is possibly compromising herself in attempting to reclaim one only out of a tribe better ignored altogether  one onlybut that one an immortal soul that never in all the eternal ages can cease to live and living to suffer if in the whole world there is not enough of compassion found to save her from a doom of such unitnagined horror one only but that one unspeakably precious in the sight of the god who made her for himself that we know his beloved son would have come down from heaven to die in his awful agony for her alone had she only of all the human race been perishing and sinful you speak of thousands like her is it not enough to crush ones very soul with horror to think of what they are in the sight of the righteous heaven and shall be probably for ever  and the thought that it is their own fellowcreatures who have thus blasted their souls with eternal ruin makes one wonder that god ehould still withhold the fire which one day must justly bu to ashes a world so cruel and so polluted and cm you think hugh that apart from the judgement which will fall upon the active agents in the ruin of the thousands of whom you speak there will be no account demanded of their blood from those who were passive instruments in their destruction who might have helped who might have saved them and would not  on such as i am who ought to be ready to give my whole life to win all and any i could am i to abstain from rescuing one one actually given into my hand because some painful humiliation some bitter thence may come to wound my vanity from those who make this worlds approval the idol of their worship oh what will all that wrlnd be to me wpi am lyidg cold and stiff in the grave whence there in no reaw  how much more then wctthless in that silent time of waiting wiu be its praise or blamthe praise or blame of those who will be dust and ashes ike myself but will not the doom of that owe lost soul be eveythiu to mete 0u1l that will meet me at e baer afjand out egieist m idden depths two vdojuxl u uin md dools6 you might have saved me and you did not therefore you are my condemnation you are my sentence you are my everlasting despair   we give this passage as a specimen of the authoresss style and as affording at the same time an indication of her enthusiastic unpractical view of the subject with which she has undertaken to deal in the course of her narrative however occasional remarks will be foundwith reference to homes for fallen women and analogous institutions for exampleindicative of a large capacity for actual work it appears hard to say that what she has done has been useless labour but the most we can hope from it is that it may serve to set thinking some who never thought before of this ugly side of their social existence by all means let anything and everything that can be done be done to save individual souls by earnest doers like the authoress of  hidden depths the more closely the subject of the social evil is looked at by intelligent women the more likelihood is there of means being found to mitigate the abomination it is beyond doubt in the power of women to give a purer tone to society by doing their best to discountenance all profligacy of life in the men of their own families as well as those with whom they are otherwise brought into contact at present nothing of the kind is done and so long as no  inconvenience results even notorious impurity of life is held to be no disqualification for a man in society indeed the man of many mistresses is an object of special interest and regard with thousands of women who would affect the utmost horror and indignation at being brought into personal relationship with any woman of sullied reputation but these remarks apply only to the upper classes among the lower classes where the horrors of the social evil spread widest it is useless to think of any such ameliorating influence as that which it is possible for the women of the superior classes to exert the authoress of  hidden depths  takes no account of unfortunates below the grade of gentlemens abandoned mistresses or of the mercenaries of university towns and in saying this perhaps we say enough to show that her earnestness has been spent upon a mere fragment or two of the innumerable wrecks that strew the deadsea shore of this miserable subject we are glad however to recognise in her present work signs of an admirable literary faculty read as a work of fiction we are sure that  hidden depths  will not fail to interest thoughtful readers far beyond the average of the seasons new novels,northamerica
  against wind and tide by holme lee author of sylvan holta daughter1 c 8 vols smith elder and co thia it one of the few good novels that deserve perms nent life in a cheap edition the author has

conditions against wind and tide there is a wide canvas spread therefore for the novelist and abe bas filled it not only gracefully but in a way that shows her power  ajaind wind and tide new novell or op by holme lee 3 er vols smith elder  cowe prefer thib novel to any of the authors previous onesit bears marks of more matured talent thc story is interesting though characters are well designed though not all of them carried out with equal success the ethics and morality are free from the morbid tendency to make misery by exaggerating a secondary point of duty and selfsacrifice at the expense of common sense and common justiceindeed to slaughter all other virtues to show greater honour to the selected onea mode of proceeding against which we have often protested in the present novel the just proportions of things to each other is preserved which much increases the pleasure of the reader the love of strong contrasts the magnifying of one quality to the starving and dwarfing of all others is a snare to young authors who think thereby to obtain strong situations and powerful effects holme lee has learned better we have met with few things superior to the account of margaret hawthorne sitting on the fallen tree in the dim twilight praying to be delivered from evil and kept from temptation knowing that the man who had cruelly and dishonourably wronged her by an illegal marriage had come back and was as she believed seeking her presence but not knowing that he had returned a free man with the design of  atoning for past wrong and winning present happiness by marrying her truly not knowing that even then he was standing close beside her although unperceived by her  finding instead of the beauty and the grace he remembered a woman separated from him in

margaret hawthorne delivered from the hope and fear which had gnawed her life dies quietly and without complaint fading out of life and out of the story her work being done margaret hawthorne has nothing to do with the afterstory though it takes its root in her life and death there is nothing in the rest of the book that comes near this short episode for simple tragical led  pathos and quiet restrained power there is no strong colouring very few epithets the incidents are indicated and shadowed out rather than detailedbut they are true to the life and death  the reader is touched with a pity deeper than words or tears can speak it the remainder of the story is taken up with the history of the career of the two brothers cyrus goes to his father and becomes a fine gentleman and a genius  he chafes against his bar sinister and resents the inconveniences of his own position fancying he is feeling his mothers wrongs it is not an interesting character nor very skilfully drawn it is composed of qualities which are laid on from the outside cyrus is not a living haman being and the reader wearies of him robert his brother is more successful but he too is made in mosaic of good qualities contrasting with those which make up his brother neither of them is more than an automaton constructed with pains and ingenuity some of the incidental characters are more successful lady leigh the benefactress of orphans is good  dorothea sancton is a charming sketch  for holme lee succeeds better in indicating character than in working out fulllength studies the descriptions of natural scenery are done with evident love and feeling for outofdoor nature only they are too numerous and too elaborate but the book as a whole is of a good quality and will deservedly add to though reputation holme lee has already acquired  against wind and tide novels by holme lee 3 vols smith  eldertbe expectations raised by  sylvan holts daughter mo amply fulfilled by the authoress in this new production in many respects indeed the present novel exhibits a marked improvement over her former work the style without any sacrifice of simplicity is richer and firmer while the characters are sketched with a more free and vigorous touch the plot of  against wind and tide is original and bold a wealthy baronet sir philip nugent betrays the pretty daughter of simon hawthorne a farmer residing in the isle of wight by a false marriage as the former lady nugent is still living the offence is not only one of deception but felony on discovering the trick the victim abandons her betrayer and flies back to her father with whom she resides for the rest of her life which is only prolonged sufficiently to enable her to bring up the two sons who were the off spring of her illstarred union until the lads had grown almost to the verge of manhood shortly before this sir philip reappears  his wife is dead and he at last enjoys an opportunity to repair so far as reparation is possible the cruel wrong he had inflicted this however he has not the grace to do but tries to compound the matter with his conscience by offering to make liberal provision for the boys one of them cyrus being gifted with a poetical which means an impulsive and selfish temperament accepts the offer and quits his mothers side to plunge amidst the pleasures of the great world under his fathers protection his brother robert remains at home and when mary hawthorne dies fulfils his original plan of entering the establishment of an uncle who carries on an extensive business as manufacturer of varnish in a large provincial town both of the brothers are however brought into situations where the social consequences of their false position and equivocal parentage come into play the shadow of the bar sinister rests on both and its effects upon their respective characters and careers is depicted with unusual fidelity and power it is indeed this struggle carried on under such very different conditions of circumstance and character against a  false position which forms the staple of the story in the end robert becomes head of the varnishmaking establishment and enjoys a fair allowance of domestic felicity cyrus passes through many vicissitudes of passion fame and fortune he writes poems which confer on him a brief popularity wins the love of a young lady whom his own father snatches from him by making her the second lady nugent commits diverse escapades gets terribly and ruinously into debt breaks with sir philip and comes to london to make his own way as poet journalist or miscellaneous adventurer in relating this portion of her heros career and especially when delineating the characteristics and habitudes of the very peculiar class whom mr wbitty has denominated  friends in bohemia the authoress has shown a keener and truer insight into the subject than almost any of those predecessors who have ventured upon the same tempting but slippery path ultimately cyrus also becomes rich and happy after narrowly escaping death by starvation in a london garret he inherits all bis fathers unentailed property and nunies of course the lady who has been safely educating for that distinguished position all along sir philip himself is perhaps if moral considerations alone prevailed let off much too easily he is a thorough and selfish villain but is allowed to enjoy a long and prosperous life chequered only by a few compunctions and an awkward dilemma or two but as moral justice or what we think such seldom rules the destinies of humanity in real life we must not complain if it is sometimes omitted from the artistic presentments of ideal life by the novelist in every respect  against wind and tide deserves to command not merely the brief popularity assigned to a successful  novel of the season but a respectable station among works destined for more enduring fame,northamerica
  a lady of quality i by frances hodgson a burnett warne  co it is certain that no more striking proof has yet been given of mrs hodgson burnetts versatility than in her latest work and versatility if the most prominent is not the only feature that strikes us in a lady of quality mistress clorinda is a dramatic figure after the style of mr george meredith whether it be the baby arousing sir jeoffrys paternal interest by the use of his own huntingcrop and the language of his own stable as applied to himself or the beautiful girl riding to hounds in breeches with her fathers boon companions or again for her own ends adopting brocaded petticoats a dignified demeanour and a duenna but still the terror of her householdtho reader will follow with fascinated interest the fortunes of clorinda wildairs it is idle to reflect whether such a woman could have had her being even in the eighteenth century her later history raises a moral question of which space denies us the full discussion that a woman may break two important commandments and yet live successively as the honoured wife of an earl and a duke and ultimately die in the odour of sanctity as the purest and noblest lady god eer loved seems to our thinking unfair  not i said she as a girl  there thou mayest trust me i would not be found out and she kept her word with conscientious success it would seem that her great love for the duke worked in her a great redemption certainly the duchess of osmonde led not merely a blameless so much might be said for the countess of dunstanwolde but an admirable life and mrs burnett is obviously as convinced of her heroines virtues as the duke himself even the pious anne an excellent foil throughout to her tempestuous sister absolves her from the need of confession to her husband it might be urged in her defence that such a woman is a law unto herself or again that the necessity as clorinda judged it for the second crime was sufficient punishment for the first for ourselves we are oldfashioned enough to consider the moral doubtful be that as it may clorinda whether as maid countess or duchess is a strong not to say daring figure marred by an occasional lapse into cheap sensationa fault to be deplored in mrs burnetts workbut as a whole unquestionably striking it is greatly to the credit of the story that it holds in itself sufficient life and movement to carry us over the tedious reproduction of eighteenth century language upon which as well as upon the setting generally the author has bestowed an infinity of pains,northamerica

  sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think

  the making of a man by e h lacon watson brown langham  co the plot of this novel is conventionally melodramatic but the treatment is quiet effective and workmanlike it suggests the work of a good craftsman tired or too indifferent to give himself the trouble of thinking out a good plot the habit of thought and of analysis persists and consequently in this book one finds some thoughtful passages and some very fair characterdrawing though the whole considered as a novel is indifferent the writer should be capable of something a good deal better half the story is concerned with the country somewhere in the shires the other half with bohemian life in london largely in the temple  the making of a man bv e h lacon witcou os brown langham mr lacon watsons new novel is concerned with the making of at least one man and the unmaking of two the man who is made is jack sugden the son of a kindly and delightfully whimsical country parson he goes to london to study for the bar on such small allowance as his father can manage to scrape together for him and when his father is overtaken by misfortunes that will not permit of his continuing his generosity jack having plenty of pluck and being inspiringly in love contrives to struggle through to success almost unaided the end which puts an end to the only two unpleasant persons in the book dr henderson and the insufferable poet march is rather too violent and melodramatic otherwise the characterisation is excellent and the stori is told reticently with a quiet realism and is full of interest mr lacon watson has an easy lucid style that makes admirable reading,northamerica
  the algonquin legends of new england b charles g leland sampson low  co when mr leland offers from the mic mac a tale partly in blank verse as far as form goes and in plot a mixture of the french tale of the bears son and the conclusion of the scotch 4 nicht nocht nothing one feels at first as if things were not all as they should be in mic mac this story is styled  the three strong men  pp 311 323 in the narrative comes a sevenheadti devil one of the beings so familiar in slavonic miirchen then the critic turns back to p 207 where mr leland tells him that  this srheaded son  of hymer in the vafthrudnismal reappears as a demon in the passamaquoddy tale of  the three strong men whatever may be the case in passamaquoddy certainly in mic mac the demon is sevenheaded then rises the question why should the seven  headed or sixheaded in passamaquoddy demon be the sixheaded son of hymer of the  vafthrudnismal why indeed  we cannot answer the question though we feel certain that the mic mac story is a compound of two stories which are european though also found more or less in malagasy mr leland himself admits part of this the story consists of a very old indian legend mingled with a european fairy tale drawn through a french canadian source but what part of the tale is very old indian  the original mr leland says  is from beginning to end a song or poem that is why we presume he has rendered so much of it into blank verse printed as prose in the tale the hero loses his memory and forgets his bride when his hand is licked by a black dog this is the celtic idea of the man who was to let no one kiss him and who lost all memory of the past when  kissed  by a dog we fail to see what is indian in the whole tale except perhaps mention of wigwams and the like now if this tale be so notably european though already converted into a kind of chant by the mic macs and if the norse identifications p 207 be so far from convincing to a moderate scepticism the rest of mr lelands collection is also not likely to be accepted without shyness he is perhaps chiefly interested himself in the resemblances between the tricky lox of passamaquoddy and the tricky loki of scandinavian myth the resemblances are often strong but would be stronger if for example mr leland offered p 271 any proof that  the fellow who played the trick a trick very like one of lokiswas lox he says  we may very easily detect the hand of lox the mischiefmaker in this last incident but lox has never been mentioned or hinted at in the tale mr leland may he right but every one must decide for himself as to the plausibility of the conjecture mr leland thinks that a good deal of eddaic lore has filtered through the eskimo to the algonquins and certainly many curious coincidences in eddaic and indian folklore may be accounted for by that hypothesis though we are not yet convinced of its accuracy perhaps for complete proof other examples of indian institutions dress weapons gear of every kind derived from norsemen might be adduced they would certainly strengthen the hypothesis one story which represents  master rabbit as originally the possessor of a long tail will at once suggest  brer babbit did the negroes borrow this incident from the indians or the indians from the negroes or did both invent it separately or did both derive it from a common source  these are questions which it is all but impossible to answer many of the negro rabbit tales have been brought from africa where they were told about a beast not very unlike a rabbit superficially perhaps others have been borrowed from indian sources on all these points it is hard or rather it ought to be impossibleto dogmatize at present we confess that after reading all mr lelands talesvery good tales very well told  we are slightly inclined not to believe in scandinavian influence on the algonquin legends the evidence and inferences are evenly balanced and perhaps it is only the hardness of the mythological heart that resists in any case mr lelands book though we wish he had avoided blank verse is extremely interesting and valuable both in itself and in its probable effects other american collectors of the red mens legends will be encouraged we hope to publish them as literally as possible this is the great point already we knew from schoolcraft and others that the red mens tales resemble and in fact are variants of the european marchen how much of this likeness is due to scandinavian and more recent french and english influences that is precisely the question which at present it is impossible to answer but which many readers of mr lelands book will reply to by voting for an infiltration of the edda only he himself can state his case at sufficient length and with his own evidence so to algonquin legends we send the mythologist no abstract can or should satisfy him,northamerica

  overshadowed l the shorter poems of frederick tennyson macmillan and co it is probable that few people know the name of frederick tennyson save from the chance connexion of relationship to the great poet laureate for all that he was a poet of no mean ability who but for the eclipsing glory of his brother might conceivably have made a name conspicuous in the history of victorian literature he had unfortunately too retiring a disposition a nature too fond of abstract study and a soul that loved and sought for seclusion such ideals were hardly the right weapons for a fight necessary to make the dense understand the separate identities of his brother and himself and frederick tennyson never tried to do more than please his friends with the poems that were to him one of the easiest methods of expression with no wish for a public reputation the poet did not restrain himself sufficiently ever to get it in his constant use of capitals which to him doubtless conveyed an extra interpretation and significant reality in his vagueness and diffuseness of expression and the frequent antitheses he employed may be traced without especial difficulty the fondness for the abstract that can never make frederick tennyson really popular with any except those who look for poetry to convey to them something beyond a simple story with a moral or a motto and a sweet sense of emotional music frederick tennyson very often does tell a simple story and he very often uses exceedingly sweet lines but in general his style is very different examine a verse from a poem entitled the mountain so from the faroff mount of poesy the worlds great shows like the hushd champaign seem the actual insubstantiality real what is shaped in fancys eager eye fear love a hope a dream it is doubtful if any but real poets will appreciate this stanza with its harshness in places and abstractness of philosophical ideas but there are times when frederick can become as philosophical and as musical as browning take for example these two lines with all the great dreams that lie behind all the possibilities of eternity and all the conceptions that hover behind space climbing into the awful infinite those stairs whose steps are worlds very roughly indeed this is the main trend of ideas that run through this book for we must admit that frequently the theme is monotonous and the poet reiterates in a different manner what he has already expressed it must be understood however that though there are many faults of style and execution in the craft of the poetry yet in itself the poems are those which only one who had soared above the realms of minor poetry could have written,northamerica

  maru lyndon or revelations of a life an autobiography new york strange  towns i end london low  co  this is a story written by a woman as a protest against the social grievances of which as she conceives women have an especial cause of  complaintthese are the legal tyranny of husbands and the difficulty for a woman to obtain  cheap and easy divorce this being the text i it is not difficult to imagine that the authoress  makes out a strong case of special pleading j mary lyndon the heroine is a strongminded womanmany many degrees above proof  she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment  a susceptible female but out of them all  she comes forth triumphantly an  emanci pated woman offering herself as an example  and a leader to her sex for our own part we  must confess that upon closing the book we had j come round to the verdict of the sagacious old1 ham jury on the trial of a man for killing his  j wife that he had served her right most   readers will we fancy feel unfeigned compas sion for mr albert hervey who for some sin  in a previous state of existence is sentenced to become the husband of mary lyndon the authoress is not without talent but she chokes i  all sympathy in her readers by the hard arro  gant dogmatical selfcomplacency with which   she puts herself forward the book is written   in the worst style of american bad tastefull   of pedantry and fine writing the story is one j that simply told and written in a better spirit p might have been made not only interesting but profitable for it touches upon many deeply  j interesting points in the secret and social life of women but as it stands it is only redeemed from being absurd by being detestable the heroine begins with her early childhood and goes through all the miseries that can beset a child for the purpose of shoving how ignorant foolish and bigoted were all the people placed in authority over her they treat her wrong they feed her wrongthey clothe her wrong they teach her wrongand she has to find herself in every thing in fact from her own account of herself she seems to have been sent into the world like a bottle of patent medicine labelled and attested to cure every imaginable female complaint social or physical dissatisfied with the religious teaching she receives from her parents she becomes a quaker and going to visit some quaker friends she receives an offer from a man to whom she conceives a violent antipathy at first sight and accepts him her account of the matter is that  his friends pleaded and besought her to marry him and m  a whirl of persuasions that literally made me dizzy i consentedmy time was well nigh come when fate met me in the path of life and i fell on my face and worshipped a young man such as i had seen in my daydreams was introduced to me by hervey i lovedand i awoke to the consciousness of living death the hours i spent with my friend whose sphere was a constant beneficence to me were whitewinged moments such as make our ideal of heaven my heart sprang to him as the flower lifts its petals to the warm sunlight in spite of this she keeps her engagement and marries herveyand  does her duty by him in a style that would make any husbands blood curdle in his veins at the prospect of what might have been his lot had the gods given him such a wife she of course as a pendant to her own portrait as a model wife and victim paints her husband in conjugal colours that rival the superfluous blackness of an illustrious personage who must not be named to ears polite after a while she separates from him gives lectures at a lyceum and takes up a highly platonic attachment to an exquisite transcendentalist  with a face fair and beautiful as a babes his complexion was the rose and lily shining through a skin that was the transparent medium of hereditary scrofulahe stood radiant as the rose and pearl of a seashellthe blessed moon raining her silver sheen on his waving and golden hairhis broad forehead shining with unearthly lustrehis beaming eyes looking up as if in most calm and wise and loving worshipi said  i hope you have had a pleasant evening all evenings he replied are pleasant in the depths of being when we feel our oneness with the infinite c c the conversation continues much longer in a similar strainhe looking into her being with the spell of a sweet and serene strength mesmerises her we suppose as she adds calmly and silently i seemed to settle into the inmost of my life till i rested as on the downy bosom of bliss this remarkable man dies the ladys husband wishes her to return to him but she declines as it would hurt her conscience to be a legal harlot she therefore remains a sad separate wife emancipates herself at last from all the limited liabilities of the female sex and takes a regular degree as a homoeopathic physician practising the watercure also by which she obtains at length money fame and strangely enough respectability she blooms out also into a celebrated authoress and discovers in a highly distinguished editor the ideal husband who would be necessary to the completion of her moral being and after the interchange of more than a hundred pages of love letters which are all given at full length finally she resolves to obtain a divorce if she can from her husband and if she cannot to live with the man of her choice as his wife without the legal sanction however to save the punctuaties as the chinese call them the original husband applies for a divorce and she telling mr vincent that if her love should ever lead her from him she must go and making a few other stipulations consents to appoint a day for the ceremonyand the book concludes amid the same profusion of fine words and selfcomplacent arrogance which prevail in the beginning if women can only be emancipated at such a cost of all that is pure lovely and of good reportof all that has ever been regarded as having  any virtue or any praiseboth men and women will we

customs history and geography and moonrsl life as it actually is in barbary in the present day and not as it usually appears amid the vague and poetic glamour of the common moorish romance the lcrber is an historical tale not merely having a foundation in fact but not widely departing from it nevertheless it is as wild and strange and full of an absorbing interest as any romance we ever read adding another confirmation to the proverb that  truth is stranger than fiction the writing is vigorous and at times even brilliant and thus in this singularly cheap volume we have at once the pleasure of a romance and the profit of pictures by a person intimately acquainted with the aspect and the people of a country of which very little is knowu to us  the berber or the mountaineer of the atlas a tale of the sallee hovers by william starbuck mayo md author of  kaloolah bentley dr mayo is evidently afraid of the author of  kaloolah as a piece of grave exaggeration a wellsustained satire on the american practice of marvellous taletellingwe held and hold that romance to be unrivalled we admire the size of the writers lions the length of his boaconstrictors the magnificence of his cities and the splendour of his african kingsthe grandeur and originality of his whole system of pennyalining and we enjoyed more than one hearty laugh at the satirefor the magniloquent descriptions were more than relieved by slight touches of pathos and humour but the authors genius for quiet caricature appears to have well nigh exhausted itself in his first effortby the side of  kaloolah the  berber  pales its ineffectual fire the materials of the story are here much the same as in the former case this time the distressed and captured damsels are spaniards and christians their lovers areone a bold and famous pirate with the sound of whose dreaded name andalusian mothers frighten their refractory infants  the other a yet more famous chieftain of the berber tribe a white man and a christian who is trying to introduce the religion and civilization of europe into the mountain ranges of the atlas a medley of jews arabs moors and berbers make up the remainder ofthe dramatis personaan historical personage  muley ismael sultan of morocco plays a leading part in the story but the interest chiefly clings to the berber chief with his grand notions and inchoate reformations the tale is too crowded with incident and adventure for us to attempt to give even its outlines we shall therefore content ourselves with presenting an extract or two and leaving them to tell their own tale the following passage brings forward the despotand a message to him from the hero  it was morning at mequinez in a large court communicating with the garden of the hareem were assembled all the dignitaries of the court a body of black troops lined each side of the square four stalwart negroes lounged at a little distance from the archway by which the soltan was expected to enter these were the executioners the invariable attendants at a  meshourah or royal audience who at a look from their master could seize the unfortunate subject of the monarchs wrath and tossing him into the air let him fall so as to break any prescribed number of bones or to kill him outright in front of the areli were gathered the officers of the court the chief dignitaries of the city mingled with kaids and lieutenantkaids from morocco and fez and bashaws from the provinces of soos and tefilet at a little distance a group of four or five jews in black sk ulcap and bornoose cowered in deprecating attitude beneath the fierce looks of the negro guard a striking contrast was that lie i ween the insolent air of these black barbarians from the further side of the sahara and the subdueel voices and anxious looks of the maroquien courtiers  may god prolong the life of the soltan whispered a bashaw to the kaid of the gate  hast thou heard in what mood it has pleased his majesty to rise this morning  may the soltans life be prolonged replied the kaid  a eunuch just whispered me that it had pleased our lord the shereef to rise with his sword in his teeth and the word passed through the groups of anxious officials that something had gone wrong with his majesty during the night and that probably more than one head would roll from its shoulders in token of the soltans displeasure    long life and health to sidi may god preserve sidi shouted with one accord the courtiers at the same time prostrating themselves to the ground and crouching and cringing around the soltan endeavouring to touch his feet or to kiss his garments or the trappings of his horse the soltan however kept his horse in motion and his cimeter whirling and it was with no small expenditure of agility that his courtiers contrived to pay their customary salutations and yet to preserve their bodies from the horses hoofs or their necks from the steel as it was several turbans were already cut through and a dozen haicks were stained with blood when suddenly the soltan checked his horse and sheathing his cimeter with a growl of rage he passed his hands into the folds of his sash and drew out a paper

follows to the powerful muley ismael emperor of morocco soos and tefilet whom god preserve in the paths of justice and mercy know that thy demand for more tribute than the free amazerg of the hills

upon his knees god knows but you do not growled the soltan and yet you are kaid of the gatesmuley ishmael glared around upon his court with the look of a tiger selecting a victim and then raising his finger the four negroes darted upon the prostrate and grovelling form of the unfortunate officer  god is great and there i9 no god but god may he lengthen the life of sidi exclaimed the kaid but with the words in his mouth his body was whirled aloft on the extended arms ofthe gigantic negroes and then dashed head first with mortal loree upon the marble pavement the soltan stared lora moment with a grin of maniacal rage distorting his toothless mouth upon the lifeless body of the kaid while courtiers began to elevate their voices in expressions of admiration of his justice and goodness and in wishes for his long life and prosperity one moor however of a dignified mien and of ti complexion that would have compared for clearness and whiteness with that of the inhabitants of northern europe stood a little apart in silence he either could not or would not join in the sycophantic plaudits that were beginning to arise from all quarters of the court as the eyes of the monarch turned from the body of the kaid they fell upon the silent figure of the moor  hah  exclaimed the soltan  abdallah ibn asken  what thinkest thou of the justice of the shereef  to approve or disapprove in answer to such a question it was well known to lie attended with equal danger and for a moment abdallah stood without making any reply with a deepdrawn yell of concentrated passion muley ishmael spurred towards him  dog son of a christian you a descendant of the ommeyah of andalusia  he shouted and raising his sword let it fall with full force upon the head of the moor who as the blade descended received it without moving from his tracks luckily the thick turban afforded a partial defence but still the keen steel cleft the scalp and glancing inflicted a deep wound in the shoulder the sword itself by the force of the blow was wrenched from the soltans hand and flew out some distance on the pavement quietly abdallah turned took a few steps picked up the sword and deliberately wiped the bloody blade upon his haik isle then advanced to the emperor who sat motionless upon his horse and presenting the hilt bowed his head god is ged exclaimed abdallahand i submit to my fate at his hands and at the hands of the sherecf muley ismael although one of the most suspicious irritable and cruel tyrants that ever filled a throne had his moments of generosity from the extreme of passion it was no uncommon thing for him to pass to the extreme of kindness and condescension receiving the cimeter he returned it to its sheath and then unbuckling the belt handed it back to abdallah  receive this said the soltan oh worthy descendant of the royal ommeyah may god restore their dynasty to the throne of cordovareceive it as a token of our satisfaction that there is at least one brave and honest man in our court abdallah bowed himself to the stirrup of the soltan and kissed his foot muley ishmael placed his hand upon the moors head and raising it exclaimed in a loud voice long life to abdallah ibn asken chief kaid of the gates as historical heresy is the fashion of the times dr mayo asserts his right to dispute the old traditions of conquest mr disraeli has done his best to prove the intellectual preponderance of the mosaic arabsmr urquhart claimed a similar supremacy in mind and prowess for the saracensand now dr mayo comes forward to support the claims of the berbers that a civilised and noble people did once inhabit the southern provinces of spain is pretty certain and our author contends that the heroes and statesmen the poets and architects of seville and cordovathe warriors who routed alfonzo on the battlefield of zalaca and those who riotously swept the country up to the very mountains of asturiaswere not of arab but of berber origin we have no doubt that the american author could maintain his theory with as much plausibility as his european rivals do theirs but we have not space to discuss questions of history with the romancer he is more at home in his own element of marvels and masquerades heroes are always heroeseven in their teens and of course the mountaineer of the atlas performed exploits in his youth the sheik of arbazza was a shereef and a saint began the rais in a low but distinct voice he was of a pure arabic stock and n bitter hater of the berbers he was also the wealthiest man in all the kingdom of fez and among his riches he possessed one thing that he valued more than all the rest a mare of the most famous blood of duquella her pedigree could be traced back for ages and the fame of her beauty and her speed filled the whole land she was a thoroughbred deafener and winddrinker she was as the apple of his eye anil proud was the sheik of arbazza that he was the owner of a creature that for beauty fire speed and endurance could not be matched travel the world over the sheik of arbazza was at feud with several of his neighbours both of plain and hill and numerous attempts were made by his enemies and if the truth must be told by several of his friends to dispossess him of his favourite but the sheik was a wary man and vain were all the efforts of treacherous friends and open enemies he was also a boastful and an arrogant man and he prided himself not a little on his ability to defeat anel punish any attempt to carry off the descendant of the famous maha el pahr or steed of the sea already had several gallant and adventurous spirits perished and more had failed and been driven hack in disgrace when the vanity of the sheik slipped the bridle of prudence and gallopped ott with him without cheek or restraint he published an invitation to all who felt disposed to steal his famous mare he announced a defiance to the boldest and most adroit horsestealers in all the empire he even offered in his vain sense of security a reward of a thousand gold metzcals to whoever should succeed in earning off el ilassaneh or the beautiful of course after this the watchfulness of the sheik was not relaxed or los precautions decreased each night the mare was picketted by the door of his tent one end of an iron chain was put around her leg and locked and the key deposited in the sheiks girdle the other end of the chain was brought within the tent passed under the sheiks bed and fastened to the tent pole within reach of his hand stood his loaded gun the match always burningand the sheik was the most famous marksman of the tribes without the tent a pack of the largest and fiercest dogs threatened every intruder with instant death among the enemies of the sheik the principal one consisted of a portion of the beni mozarg and of course nothing would have delighted the berbers more than for one of their number to have achieved the feat of carrying off the sheiks famous mare on though one hand was every inducement to attempt the adventurepride revenge the love of glory and an admiration of horseflesh but on the other hand there were too many obstacles in the waythe distance to the plains the difficulty of approaching the dounh the canine guards the chain and more than ali the watchfulness and prowess of the sheik these obstacles had been found by repeated experiments insurmountable and the very bravado ofthe sheik while it was looked upon as the worst of insults helped to deter the boldest of thc berbers from undertaking the adventure at that time casbin son of the amekran of the beni mozarg was scarce turned of thirteen hut already had he killed the king of beasts and acquired the name of el subah or the lion it was noticed that the young prince was for days busy in constructing a strong basket or rather cage the holes in it were just wide enough to admit a hounds nose and the withes were of the stoutest kind and wound with strips of untanned hide the basket excited much curiosity but not a word did the young chieftain vouchsafe as to the purpose to which it was to be applied but great i waa the surprise when catching a common cat he enclosed her in the

fought with each other in their eagerness for a bite they had no etti ears noses or mouths for any thing except the cat making a detour casbin came upon the tent foo the other side at a proper distance he slipped from his horse secured him in a moment and advanced to the tent slowly noiselessly with his breast to the ground the young prince crept up and put hu head in under the curtain all was dark save a fiuv glimmer that came from the womens apartment the sheik was asleep casbin drew his body into the tent the first thing he did was to feel for the gun which he noiselessly emptied of the ball and replaced in its position he then drew his knife and stretching himself by the side of the sheik deliberately began cutting through his woollen sash firs on one side and then on the other the slumber of the sheik were far from sound but so quietly and skilfully was the operation conducted that hews not awakened nor any alarm given to the other inmates of the tent the front turns of the sash were lifted from the sleeper upon running his hand through the folds casbin lighted at once upon the key the most difficult part of the adventure was achieved casbin stuck his dagger in the ground ia front of the sheiks face and as slowly and as noelessly as before crept under the door curtain of the tent there stood the noble animal el hamnth the beautiful the rain had ceased the clouds had suddenly broken away and the bright starlight mingled with the first faint sheen of dawn revealed her beautiful proportions to the young prince but not long did he tarry to admire he took one look to make sure that it was indeed she the muchpraised and oftdescribed beauty and then applying the key to the padlock liberated her foot from the chain he threw over her head a hempen bridli he freed her fetlocks from the cords by which she was picketted he vaulted on her back oh sheik ali shouted the youth come forth and bid adieu to your favourite no answer wo returned and casbin springing lightly to the ground seized the end of the chain and giving it a vigorous shake vaulted again to the back of el hassaneh come forth oh most arrogant sheik of arbazza shouted casbin  your mare will not leave you without returning you thanks for your favours the curtain ofthe tent was thrown violently aside one glance showed to the horrorstricken sheik hil favourite freed from her chain and with some one on her back he hesitated not an instant with a groan of rage he raised his gun to his shoulder and fired what was his astonishment to find that the audacious rider still preserved his seat the report of the gun and the burst of boyish laughter that followed it aroused all the inhabitants of the down the arabs came pouring out of their tents obmost renowned sheik cried the prince  thou

  the precipice by ivan goncharov hodder  stoughton 6s in the preface to this work the anonymous translator having admitted an unfavourable comparison between the writings of goncharov and those of turgenev dostoyevsky and tolstoy goes on to say that the reason that goncharov is  much less known to the western reader is also due to the fact that there was nothing sensational either in his life or his literary method the word  sensational in the sense of its common usage is not one we ourselves should apply to the literary method of either turgenev or dostoyevsky these writers often made use of melodramatic situations but their characterisation is so minutely and simultaneously developed with the action of a story that an effect of intensity is produced which is unknown to western writers the method of goncharov is nearer to that of turgenev dostoyevskys unabashed revelation of character whatever its fantasy or depth gives place to the employment of mystery both in the development of plot and of character itself realisation of suffering or renunciation appear as an inevitable denouement but with goncharov the story is broken off according to the dictates of climax while dostoyevsky is concerned with a larger plan which entails that his character should go on with its development regardless of the fall of the dramatic curtain the precipice is a remarkable story full of dramatic and powerful situations and it is told in the slavonic way whereby introspection is added to romanticism we may recommend it as a very interesting addition to our knowledge of russian writers who although they do not possess the tremendous qualities of dostoyevsky fully demonstrate the peculiar narrative strength characteristic of russian fiction mr fisher unwin announces a study of contemporary belgian literature by jethro bithell with extracts from the leading authors  russian fiction the precipice by ivan goncharov riodder  stoughton us oblomov by ivan goncharov translated by c j hogarth allen  unwin 6s the volumes before us illustrate the extent of the dependence of the average reader in the matter of russian translations upon the publisher or translator the length of each of the two versions in question is roughly onethird of that of its original the remaining twothirds have been condensed into passages of a few lines apiece or simply lopped off in the original of  the precipice  there are several characters who do not appear in the english version from mr hogarths  oblomov it is possible to pick out the translators condensations of omitted passages as they contrast strikingly with the even flow of the action in neither translation is the fact of omissions even indicated the novels are not short in the original russian  the precipice  runs to 992 large pages in the complete edition of 188796 and the publication of unabridged versions may well have appeared too unremunerative an undertaking in that case the publishers should have taken the public into their confidence and not have issued these truncated fragments as the complete novels ivan goncharov 181291 holds a high place among russian novelists of the last century bv his three great works   a common story  1847 oblomov  1859 and  the precipice  1870 it is usual to compare him with turgenev and indeed the resemblance is obvious both writers were deeply concerned with the ineffectual character of the middleclass russian youth so divided in his allegiance to conflicting theories and political faiths as to be often incapable of decision or even action oblomov the hero of the novel of that name is the supreme type of this young manhood he has a generous heart and distinct intelligence but the national disease holds him in its grip and his life is consequently passed in a dressinggown in which he lounges gaping at the ceiling too slack even to have it repaired and himself insured against the dangers of crumbling plaster overheadthis pleasing touch by the way seems to have been omitted from mr hogarths version raisky the hero of  the precipice is cast in the same unheroic mould he believes himself an artist although he never achieves anything almost on the last page he decides to become a sculptor goncharov had not the craftsmanship of turgenev nor his succinctness of description his women have not the individuality of turgenevs creations but oblomov will live at least as long as bazarov in  fathers and children which is saying a great deal perhaps the most regrettable feature of these translations is the probability that for some time they will bar the way to complete versions until such versions appear readers anxious to make the acquaintance of goncharov should procure mrs constance garnetts translation of  a common story the shortest of his novels published in 1895,northamerica

  the conquest of charlotte by david s rmw kj9 meldrum blackwood  sons mk meldrums latest fifeshire romance is good reading one feels perhaps some small sense of irritation at the way in which old characters continually disappear and new ones are evolved throughout the 392 closely printed pages yet this is a small blemish to set against the conception of rab the rascal who one is thankful to find continues his eccentric course to the last he is a fascinating character mr meldrum shows that it is not necessary in writing of the scots to descend into a sea of unintelligible patois the whole book comes as a welcome relief after those which would lead us to believe that the inhabitants of scotland devote their entire energies to analysing their own and their neighbours religious convictions in interminable pages imperiously demanding a glossary the story steers skilfully between the scylla of patois and the charybdis of pawkiness it is in fact a marked advance on anything the author has yet produced  fiction the conquest of charlotte bv david s meldrum blackwood 6s mr meldrum is not one of the many gentlemen whose names are the commonplaces of publishers lists so far as we know tjie conquest of charlotte makes only his fourth book and his second novel readers of the story of margredel many of them at any rate saw in that story qualities of freshness and discernment which gave promise of a writer who would qfi day search more deeply into life and present them with a study more subtle and more detached and here in the conquest of charlotte we have that study a book clearly devised and written with the utmost and most loving care full of colour in character as well as in the brave shows of nature yet it falls short of complete success and that for two reasons it is overelaborated in manner and unessentials and it is too external the two things seem to go together  while we are often surprised by the finish of the setting we ar conscious of a certain shadowiness of characterisation we do not feel that here right under our fingers is the full pulse of life from this generalisation however we would exclude the elder charlotte the mother of the younger charlotte whose conquest furnishes the sentiment of the book the older woman is nobly conceived and perhaps because mr medrum has treated her rather more broadly than others of his characters she wins more surely to our affection and belief it is upon the study of rab cuick the smuggler and father of the second charlotte that mr meldrum seems to have concentrated himself the girl is well enough but she never grips us like her mother nor has mr meldrum succeeded in contriving for her anything so delightful as the  cast shoe chapter of her mothers youth rab cuick does not quite as it were get home rascal he was but his delinquencies were hardly of the kind to inspire his family with the fear and disgust which move them yet we feel that mr meldrum was himself wholly convinced by rab there must have been subtleties of spiritual mischief in the man which he has not succeeded in conveying to us the better side of him his fine love of freedom and the open and his curious misguided pride mr meldrum has succeeded in presenting writh perfect success it is when he comes to the delicate psychology of rab that we lose our way the general manner of the story is too diffuse again and again the flow of the narrative is checked for the introduction of extraneous matter often good in itself but without value to the scheme of the book the possible verisimilitude for instance gained by the introduction of the pedigree of a minor character does not compensate for our sense of annoyance there are descriptions of locality too so complicated that only a map could render them perfectly clear and this brings us back to that question of overelaboration mr meldrums pages are crowded with simile and metaphor these are often fine the book is full of a balanced and beautiful exaltation but they are run too hard let us illustrate  the verity of our freedom did not steal upon us like the dawn athwart the eastern headlands but plumped into our consciousness with tropic wonder that sudden flash of poetry in mr foster illumining the sordid round of his schoolmastering was like the crimson burst at long years interval upon the cactusplant charging his prickliness for me with incipient tenderness perhaps these two random examples standing by themselves hardly sufficiently enforce our point but when similar matter occurs continually it will de seen that the reader is not to be blamed if he wearies of mr meldrums indirectness yet when all is said the conquest of charlotte remains a book to be seriously considered mr meldrum is primarily and essentially a literary artist that his work is a little too selfconscious is one of the defects of his qualities  indeed it is only on applying a strictly critical standard that such faults as we have pointed out become manifest arid to apply that standard to most  successful novels would be to damn them in a line mr meldrum is one of the very few living novelists wthose work rouses genuine emotion  the conquest of chamatte by d s meldrum scotch this long romance which has appeared serially in the pages of blackwoods magazine is dedicated  to all shorerovers old and young on the st brise coast

  mr jack hamlins mediation and other stories american fiction by bret harte pearsonthe eight stories in this volume are all worth reading they are after the manner of a good many of mr bret hartes tales of the far west in the early fifties and some of them are as good as any except the very best of the authors earlier works familiarity has possibly taken off the edge of ones enjoyment in some of the details  but one misses the striking picturesqueness of scenery which has often contributed a good deal to the effect of the authors tales and there seems to be some sameness in the abrupt and always agreeable ending jack hamlin is a typical character sure to be a favourite the man at the semaphore is perhaps the most original and effective of these stories mr paul leicester ford continues to write very good literature his latest novel janice meredith published here by messrs constable is a long and detailed account of various persons more or less intimately connected with the american war of independence or as it is more frequently called in the states the american revolution there is plenty of fighting between troops and lovers the young lady whose name is given in the title to the novel finds herself in the hands of both sets of belligerents and as she possesses lovers and admirers in either camp she has some trouble to play her cards to the best advantage the narrative in which these features occur is pleasant reading it is a long and sometimes intricate story but it is invariably interesting so long is it that we are probably within the mark in saying it contains two hundred thousand words but it goes straight through the history of a war which lasted for seven years such a book would be difficult to read were it not written with ease and grace now and then a hard word occurs which is probably clearer to an american than an english reader for instance primped peeked in  possibly a misprint calimanco it may be doubted if an american lady of one hundred and twenty years ago would use such a phrase as i know not what is transpiring which is suggestive of very modern journalism the story and the clearness of the incidents are however graphic and attractive to any one who can keep the book in his hands for many hours for it will not be read at a single sitting nor even a tenth of it the novel will add to the reputation of the author of the honourable peter stirling and of  the story of an untold love and will give him a prominent position among contemporary writers  mr jack hamlins mediation and other stories by bret harte 6s pearson bret harte never disappoints there is no other writer we can point to who produces as much and as regularly and keeps up as steady a level of good work he never forgets how to tell a story or fails to make the most of his material however slight that may be and in reading him we are continually feeling a waft of the fresh vigorous air of his earlier books from cover to cover this latest volume is at least readable the title story and  dick spindlers family christmas  are both in his   a farmers year by h rider haggard 7s 6d longmans good vein and throughout we find no falling off in his kindliness his humour and his sense of the picturesque,northamerica

  the borderland of society by charles belmont davis chicago herbert s stone  co 6s mr davis bears a name distinguished in modern american literature and it must be said that he writes astonishingly like his more famous brother there is the same attitude towards life the same faculty for finding the picturesque the same mild brightness of style most of the tales in this little volume have been taken from american magazines  it had been better if some la gommeuse  and the story of his life for examplehad remained there but one or two are good the best tales are a couple which happen not to have appeared in magazines  a winter city favourite is a picture of monte carlo society not showing muoh original observation perhaps but treating picturesquely the obviously picturesque and informed towards the end by genuine feeling and dramatio power at a cafe chontant is even betterquite in the de maupassant mannerbut marred by a certain crudity in the presentation of the climax mr davis has wandered in the purlieus of american and continental cities and has a large reserve of exotic local colour which he uses generously yet with discretion the book is a mine of strange information here for instance is some dialogue between the freaks at a dime museum in new york killed him p said the skeleton sure said the legless man died of a broken heart she was a fine blonde too he met her from the platform and married her a week later at her home in harlem they were very happy for a time and then she took up with a ticketchopper on the elevated road and radcliffe pined away and died she certainly did treat him rough you see billy couldnt walk by himself as his legs werent big enough to carry him so when the ticketohopper had finished his work he would come under the window and whistle and the blonde woman would lift billy out of bis ohair and lay him on his back on the floor while she went out billy used to lie there on his back for all the world like a turtle and kick and hollow sic for help    and the worst of it was the blonde and the ticketohopper got fifteen hundred dollars bones money  bones money   asked the skeleton  dont you know what bones money is  well you are new in the business skeletons always sell their bones to a hospital before they die the virtues of mr daviss first book are negative rather than positive he has more restraint than power more correctness than originality more discretion than artistic courage but what effects he attempts he accomplishes and for the most part the tales are very creditable,northamerica
  the child who will never grow old reviews by k douglas king john lane never have we so cordially sympathised j with darwins plea for a law compelling stories to end happily as in reading this book for of the eight tales between its covers all save perhaps one end on a note of unnecessarily poignant pathos miss king is a very herod in the way she insists on the death of the children of her fancy in the first story a little boy dies of a broken back in the second two little boys are run over by a train in the third a boy who is older than is common with mies kings heroes is killed by a drunken man in the fourth one little boy is shot with a gun fired deliberately by another little boy in the fifthbut that is the exception in the sixth a suffering baby is left to die at the workhouse uifirmary in the seventh a little boy falls over a cliff in the eighth a little boy is drowned these calamities are in themselves sorrowful enough but our misery is rendered more acute by the pains which miss king lavishes to endear her heroes to us look for example at tonybaba whose back was broken and whose history gives the title to the book tonybaha drew breath and then resumed in his customary subdued conversational tones  he said to me when id got over and we was looking at each other  my names johnnie jamiesonwhats yours   i said im tonybaba this is my dog bibi and my beauteous cat and he frowned did that johnnie jamieson oh most tremendous and he said quick as quick i can lick you all to fits   lick means beat you in fighting or racing papa  i can lick you all to fits he saidjust that and i said i can lick you  i bet you cant he said  i bet i can just smash you all up  and i said let us try a faint light sparkled in the depths of tonybabas dreamily retrospective eyes  did you try  i asked we did try he jumpted on me and i jumpted on him both together we jumpted and we got ourselves all mixed up then we began to fight and we sighted and tugged and jammed our fistses in each others eyes and we couldnt smash each other nohow we shouldnt have never left off fighting i believe and think ony johnnie caught his foot in a rabbit hole and corned toppling over and me on the top cause all our arms and legs was mixed up together  what happened next  tonybaba drew another long sigh of satisfaction  it was all quick as quick papa he said  and johnnie sort of pulled me down but i remembered just in time that it wasnt no game but that we was fighting on purpose to lick each other all to fits soi tonybaba paused artistically  so you what   i stumped on him with all my weightiest weight when he pulled me and i felled down i just stumped kerrash on top of him as heavy as i could  what did he do   im awful heavy i believe when i fall like that he didnt say no think at all 1 what happened then   we just lay staring at each other and his breathing was loud as loud only he couldnt breathe as loud as he wished to cause i was on t p of him and i was awful out of breath too then he said in a skrushed insidehim sort of voice  well anyhow my papa is bigger and braver nor yours i know  if in these stories miss king had any gift of inevitability we should not mind but she has none death is never the necessary termination of the tale life would serve just as well hence our objection and if she displayed signs of possessing unusual insight into child nature or if there were valuable results of genuine observation we should mind less but again there are none the stories are so obviously pure invention and the endings are so obviously selected because of their nearness to the authors heart that we have a right to protest in a way that we should not protest did the characters or incidents in the least convince us of reality miss king can write deverly and it is plain from the extracts given above that she has humour we beg her to be as pleasing rather than as harrowing as she can,northamerica
  uncle remus and his friends rv tnl chandler harris osgood mcllvaine co mr harris in this volume gives to the world another and we regret to see from the preface the final series of undo remuss stories about the animals this collection is quite as delightful as the last and it would be difficult to give it higher praise than that in his preface the author or editor is unduly modest about his stories chiefly it would seem because they are not literature and it appears that this is one of the reasons which must prevent uncle remuss reappearance possibly mr harriss resolution is unalterable but as far as the literature question goes whether uncle remuss tales are literature or not they are infinitely better worth reading and written with far truer art than a very great part of what is dignified with the name the only stories that are not quite so successful are those in which the animals do not appear and certainly the best are those in wnich brer rabbit  takes points as he usually does from the other animals here is a charming passage ex5baining why brer rabbit was so full of evices i dont think brother lion had much sense remarked the little boy after awhile  yit he had some responded uncle remus 4 he blecdz ter had some but he aint got much ez brer rabbit dem what got strenk aint got so mighty much sense you take niggersdez er lots stronger dan what white folks is i aint so strong mysef remarked the old man with a sly touch of vanity that was lost on though little boy 4 but de common run er niggers is lots stronger dan white folks  the volume is made up with a selection from uncle remuss songs and ballads which aro not so good as his stories and with tales illustrating his relations with his master and mistress or his shrewd sayings and doings,northamerica

  fiction ithe wind blotveth by marion mole andrew melrose 6s thanks to an unattractive and misleading title we were some time in becoming aware that miss marion moles book was not a republished serial story but an emotional narrative of considerable power and a gallery of quite clever portraits as the story runs philip halcombe an imaginative and gipsylike child hated by his father is deserted by a roman catholic sister who becomes a nun and left to the upbringing of a young anglican clergyman his guardian out of respect to the sister whom he loved makes no attempt to influence his charge religiously and philip grows up much as he pleases in the matter of a creed events separate him presently from the clergyman now married to a foolish and jealous wife and send him back to his native cathedral town there he comes upon and lives with his father a helpless paralytic nursed all alone in a dismantled house by a  queer card  called jimmy a cheerful and inspiriting person when he is sober in this atmosphere philips lack of allegiance to any particular creed is still more emphasised on reaching manhood after the death of his father an sesthetic strain in him leads him upon the stage there follows a long and rather puzzling love affair with a leading lady a half imperious half clinging altogether pathetic and untrustworthy sort of woman not at all suitable as the intellectual educator of a young man of sensibility jimmy comes in presently and proves to be her husband philip turns tragic over the disclosure returns home once more and lives for a time with his old friends the bishop and his sister but the actors instinct calls him again and takes him much to the bishops disgust into the congregational church where he wages war upon the snobbishness and pharisaism of a provincial town community as a last trial the french girl who had been the tantaliser of his boyhood meets him and steals his heart this problem is complicated by the arrival of jimmy and the actress both in dire need of his spiritual aid the effect of the two ladies upon philips congregation provides a good deal of amusement in the end he overcomes his love and saves his difficult soul certainly the french lady would not have been an ideal wife for a congregational minister all this is very fine and subtle in its way philip is decidedly a person whom one could imagine oneself meeting and there are many characters as lifelike in the book the story is full perhaps too full of incident a richness permitted and encouraged by miss moles vague and allusive methods of creating her scenes the latter trait produces an effect of thinness which is the specific fault of the story if miss mole could have erected the framework of her story simply and strongly and clearly instead of flickering to and fro as she has done in a very feminine and discursive manner her book would have been far more striking  the wind bloweth by donn byrne 6s sampson low essentially this is the story of a mans quest for happiness the man is a sailor of antrim his father a poet his mother a frenchwoman himself a queer mixture cosmopolitan as it were by birth and by years of worldtravel in great sailingships of the midvictorian days but the book is not a  story in the ordinary sense of the word it is a prose poem a pilgrimage an epic of wandering of love sought in many ways in many climes with the beauty and the irresistible call of a corner of ireland haunting it as the theme of a fugue the author has a magic touch of his own a strange power to bring music from words and nowhere is this more appealing than in his quite wonderful descriptions of places and we must add of the women whose lives for a while intersected that of shane the sailor and poet and lover the story has at times the beauty and colour of a vivid painting and the scenes are so variedireland marseilles beirut buenos ayres with many intervals of seafaringthat full scope is given for the authors particular gift we have read this book with full appreciation of its lack of coherence its rapid changes and have recognised the art behind it and felt more than a little thrilled by its uncanny power,northamerica

  the seats of the mighty by gilbert parker methuen  co mr parker seems to become stronger and easier with every serious novel that he attempts good though some of his earlier efforts were there was generally a sense of  tightness  to use an expression borrowed from drawing about his works which to some extent marred their effect he also has had a tendency to study somewhat abnormal and ingenious characters for which he is in no way to be reproached although it to a certain extent exaggerated in him an inclination to artificiality however singularities such as these are no faults but rather merits in a young author for the worst thing they produce is overelaboration a failing soon cured by time and experience in  the seats of the mighty mr parker shows the matured power which his former novels have led us to expect and has produced a really fine historical novel the scene of course is laid in canada and the central fact chosen is the glorious capture of quebec by general wolfe mr parker perhaps wisely does not make the general the chief figure in his story but he shows enough of him to make more intelligible and real the extraordinary heroism and attraction in this physically weak man i but the great creation of the book is doltaire the bastard of a french king and a peasant woman who combines in an extraordinary manner the dignity courtesy and cynicism of the old court with the rude directness and occasional savagery of the soil his character is drawn with quite masterly strokes for he is a villain who is not altogether a villain and who attracts the reader as he did the other characters by the extraordinary brilliancy of his gifts and by the almost unconscious acts of nobility which he performs there is nothing overdone about him  ono can understand fully why he was so successful and why he almost succeeded in fascinating the heroine and one can equally understand the loathing felt for him by the hero capt moray and his fine doath is not unworthy of his life capt moray himself is by no means the shadowy creature that the hero of an historical novel is apt to be his sufferings in prison are well told and his exploits during the escape down the st lawrence river and in his brief return to quebec are almost worthy of dumas for their foolhardy ingenuity most sincerely is mr parker to be congratulated on the finest novel he has yet written,northamerica
  wat it bight to forgive by amelia e barr fisher unwin ecno answers  in the affirmative the author has put most forcibly the arguments why adriana filmer nee van hoosen should forgive till seventy times seven her frivolous and unfaithful husband and thereby make a man of him at last it is equally clear that antony van hoosen having a vain wife nee filmer who drags his name in the dirt should also forgive on her realisation of her need of such forgiveness but there is no assumption that the cases are exactly parallel and the writer deals fairly with the physiological grounds of the disparity it must not be thought that the moral in this instance swallows up the tale life in new york and in the village of woodsome is pleasantly realistic the elder van hoosen is a dutchman without guile but with plenty of shrewdness his distant kinsman filmer is a trifle more sardonic he is a bookworm with a pushing wife who is forcing her way into that  smart set which begins to usurp the place of aristocracy on both sides of the sea the figures of adriana and her brother antony are the noble outcome of worldly experience based upon the veracities of a religious home whether calvinism be generally conducive to such an outcome we need not question but peter van hoosen is a good man on account of or in spite of his creed an element not to be neglected in oldworld america,northamerica

inwardly demurred at the extra toil imposed on him was accustomed to fetch home his wifes cousin soon he found himself wishing that the village might give all its nights to revelry gradually the wifes suspicions are aroused a hired girl is employed and mattie must go poverty makes ethan helpless money might have saved two lives if not three but there is none so the blow falls in the last act that is to consign the three to a living death it is a beautiful sad but intensely human story working out to its final conclusion with all the inevitability of a great greek tragedy  ethan fromne by edith wharton macmillan 3s 6d net among modern american writers mrs edith wharton has long since attained a welldeserved reputation as one whose books are both in matter and manner far above the average she invariably compels attention and repays the attention which she thus forces in the coin of intellectual pleasure the present story is well suited to take its place beside mrs whartons previous volumes its extent is not considerable but mrs whartons very restraint in the matter of words has increased the power which she so ably wields her example might well be followed by many a novelist by whom superfluity of verbiage is almost acclaimed as a virtue many of them ought to be willing to sacrifice much in order to be able to produce a little tragedy of such power as this or to show themselves such masters of their common art as mrs whartons work repeatedly proves her to be the little story is a pure tragedy the scene is laid in a lonely semidesolate new england village which has been left aside in the modern march of progress here it is for the most part amidst the snowfor it is a commonplace in stackfield that no soul can survive many of its wintersthat the touching lifestory of ethan from is unfolded a victim of an unsuitable marriage suffering perpetually from the nagging and the querulousness of his invalid wife half of whose ills are rooted in imagination and are therefore all the worse to herself and all with whom she comes in contact for a moment happiness and romance play before him like a willothewisp ethan was not strong enough to seize them or perhaps we should say that circumstances were stronger than he not even the obvious halfconventional solution was permitted to him and ethan returns to life and the drabcoloured realities with his miseries increased a hundredfold and new agonies created of whichhe had previously been unconscious the only relief throughout the volume is the lovepassages and these are so vivid and so realistic that one forgets the shade out of which one passes in order to reach them and basking in their sunshine almost sees them pass before the physical eye the book is slight in form but in texture it is full  fiction ethan frome by edith wharton macmillan 3s 6d net in this small volume within the limits of a story half the length of an ordinary novel mrs wharton has done all and more than other novelists would have done in the greater space there is no living novelist who knows better how to construct a story the book is a model of compression every stroke tells every detail of conversation or incident has its essential place in the structure but the effect is not that of thin economy it is rich and full in the earlier part of the story there are incidents the suggestions of which are grimly and tragically realised in the conclusion mrs wharton has a skill which she can only have learned from the greek tragedians in preparing by dramatic contrasts irony and reversal of fortune for the passionate denouement but no skill alone could have produced such stress and tenseness such exaltation and depression so highly emotional a romance brought to the dust with realistic cruelty to mrs whartons vivid and romantic imagination is added a hard sense of fact conceive the elated moods of stevenson tempered by the grimmest touches of zola and you have the holocaust of romantic passion and horrid fact which mrs wharton can serve up to us she prepares us for the catastrophe from the beginning showing to us the old man ethan frome years  after the accident with the gash still showing on his forehead and his right side shortened and warped still living at the bleak solitary farmhouse on the hillside working his meagre farm coming in to starkfield rarely and speaking seldom for he has had troubles and the neighbours respect his gloom and then we see him in his youth aged twentyeight when the trouble is brewing his home is shared by two women one is his wife zeena older than himself who had nursed his dying mother whom he had married from sheer dread of solitude she is tall bony fretful a nalade imaginaire nursing herself on patent medicines her teeth are false she looks hideous in bed she complains at everything and nags mrs zeena from is shown in the fewest words of conversation and description but the portrait of this neurasthenic fixes itself on the mind a memorable thing the other woman is zeenas cousin mattie an orphan homeless she has been taken under zeenas roof to do the work of a hired girl without wages the situation is obvious enoughbut nothing is banal when it comes under mrs whartons hand ethan adores mattie a years companionship with two such women has wrought upon him in a sense it is a mere lovestory the love of ethan for a woman to whom he must not declare himself and the  this is our second notice of elhau frow love of mattie for ethan but it is a lovestory invested with the true tragic poignancy the two are only driven to selfrevelation by the jealousy and remorselessness of zeena for one day and night zeena goes away to see a doctor and hatch her plot in the evening ethan and mattie sit by the fire in the usual manner save that the seat of zeena is empty they talk about indifferent matters shyly and in dread of breaking the sweetness of their one evening they shun the name of zeena which creeps into their conversation hauntingly as a thing of dread and ethan sees mattie as she might be in his house were zeena dead we know no description of love equal to this in contemporary english or american literature since mr hardy was at his best every little thing that happens from the spreading of the table to the breaking of the picklepot is made ominous we will not tell how mattie is driven away by zeena how ethan takes her for the last time but one down the toboggan slide and how before the inevitability of parting they resolve on one more rush down the slope not past but into the dreaded elm we merely point out that this magnificent tempestuous passage concerning the lovers resolve to die is followed by the far grimmer conclusion the taking away of the two maimed but not dead bodies and the subsequent years of sinister grumbling and ugliness that is the way in which mrs wharton nerves herself to end her story it is the cruel modern way it is bitter it is almost intolerablefor we were absorbed in the fate of these personsbut it is brilliant  ethan frome by edith wharton macmillan and co 3s 6d net if one may judge by miss whartons story starkfield mass must be a very dreary place the story itself is another variation of the eternal triangle two women and a man with a rather good ending in that the man and the woman he ought to have married attempted to commit suicide in order to solve their difficulty and be at rest togetherand the attempt failed with such possibilities of psychological study as are presented by ethan from and zeena his wife to say nothing of mattie there was material for a great though somewhat sombre and tragic work miss wharton has suggested this and in the slight sketch which she has given of these three lives has conveyed a sense of reality with her pictures of american rural life,northamerica

  the ministers wooing by h beecher stowe a low  co 11 in this novel the leading events of which the p preface informs us are  founded on actual j p facts and the principal characters of which are historic mrs stow endeavours to depict the mannera and austere religious life of new england at the close of the last century she especially commends her work to the kindly  1 thoughts of the british firesidea compliment j c which we predict the british public will repay 11 by asking for the story at the circulating libra  s ries and in due course coming to the conclusion j that notwithstanding numerous blemishes which go a long way towards counterbalancing its i merits it is a tale to be read and for nine days  to be talked about the critical few will find amusement in comparing an american ladys description of the transatlantic puritanism to which whitfield imparted fresh earnestness more than a hundred years ago with the light satiric view taken of the same subject by mr thackeray in  the virginians the ministers wooing is a love tale a religious novel and an historicor rather biographicfiction all in one regarded as the first it deserves almost unqualified praise judged of as the second it merits a certain amount of blame but viewed as an illustration of history it is open to very grave censure the opening chapters as we indicated last december induce the reader to hope he is going to be treated with a series of simple domestic episodes although his feelings are early harrowed with an enumeration of the horrors of the slave trade but unfortunately these expectations are to a certain extent disappointed and the whole question of negro emancipation is dragged up for rediscussion in this the author has acted very unwisely with all its misstatements and onesidedness exaggeration and reticence uncle toms cabin was a powerful story and created a memorable sensation  equal perhaps to that caused amongst educated english people almost two hundred years before by afra behns oroonoko the first  nigger novel of our literature mrs stow would have decided well for her fame if imitating the caution of hamilton with his famous speech she had allowed this bril liant success to remain in solitary splendour and had not lessened its effect by endeavouring to repeat it the reception that  dred met with in this country must have convinced her that her english admirers were weary of listening to the cracking of legrees whip and that their craving for imagined woes must for some time to come be gratified with more refined sorrows than the tortures of slavemarkets and plantations down south very likely mrs stow is well aware of all this for the tone of her arguments against slavery in the present work is milk and honey in comparison with the scalding indignation of the story that first brought her into notoriety there is a wide difference between the inspired angel of abolition who penned  uncle toms cabin and the calm argumentative lady who in  the ministers wooing is content with coldly enunciating the moral obligation of all men to help the oppressed and this change can only be accounted for on the supposition that either she has so far outlived the ardour of her earlier impressions that what a few years since would have been the language of fervid poetry is now nothing more than a mere habit of sermonizing or else that accurately appreciating the state of public feeling she only breathes gently on the embers of a dying enthusiasm well knowing that a stronger current of air would altogether extinguish the feeble sparks that still linger in them the scheme of that part of the story on which the rest of the narrative is hung is simple and pretty enough the drama opens with a teaparty in the parlour of the widow scudder who is a lady blessed with a small farm and  a gambrelroofed cottage on the outskirts of newport a charming daughter the heroine a sweet little maiden just emerging from chudj hoodand a high reputation for the possession j of  faculty the precise meaning of which term  may be found in the athenmtm for december  25 1858 j the principal inmate of the widow scudders house is dr h the minister who does the wooing a divine of extreme calvinistic j opinions of pure life and of a gentle nature  a man dwelling in a world of spiritual abstraci tions guileless and simpleminded as a child  austere in his habits and of inflexible firmness of principle studious and abstracted he is a kind of coleridge divested of poetic faculty and imbued with moral stability the good man is a bachelor something over forty years of age and besides officiating zealously amongst j his congregation ministering to his afflicted j black brethren and writing a profound system i of divinity finds time to act to the fair mary scudder his landladys daughter the part that abelard did to heloise he is her tutor in religious and secular studies and she in return instructs him in the art of loving but unlike heloise of old mary only conceives for him that reverential affection which a young maiden naturally entertains for her pastor who appears to her an the expression of all the goodness that is possible in humanity the widow scudder would gladly see her daughter love the pastor dearly enough to wish to be his wife  but the meek gentle child wilful in one thing only bestows her heart on a wicked scapegrace of a cousin james marvyn who having run 31 away from home and been to sea returns from 3 foreign countries to laugh at the sanctimonious ways of the godly people of newport and to question the doctrine of election and predestination the young man of course is condemned by the surrounding respectability as r utterly reprobate and poor little mary is con tinually being informed that her cousin her playmate from infancy her dearest cousin is doomed to eternal perdition the child has also amongst other tenets of that religion which calvinism grafted on the stern nature of the puritan colonists called into existence has been taught that it is her duty to contemplate the idea of her own eternal punishment with lively pleasure if by such suffering the happiness of mankind at large could be increased naturally she applies this terrible doctrine to the state of her own mind in relation to her cousin until she feels she could willingly surrender herself a sacrifice to neverending torment in order to secure him admission to an eternity of bliss one afternoon james has a stolen interview with her to say farewell as next day he is about to start on a long voyage after much earnest and pathetic conversation on religion which we extracted when noticing the first number of this work james gives her a parting kiss and once more goes off to sea the voyage is one of disaster the ship is wrecked and news comes home that tames marvyn is drowned the intelligence well nigh kills poor little mary and for many a day she seems going the downward way to death her mother who has become possessed of her darlings secret watches her narrowly anxiously and prayerfully but mary does not die her physical strength is gradually restored to her and though her heart is saddened for life she prepares like the noble selfsacrificing girl she is to forget her own woes as much as possible and to devote her life to making others happy time passes on and dr h wno has comforted her in her sorrow and sickness ignorant of the nature of the wound her affections have suffered begs her to be his wife to gratify her mother to make a good man happy and to secure to herself a field of usefulness mary accepts him the wedding clothes are provided and the day for her marriage is fixedav the day is not a week distant on which january and may are to be united togetherand mary is training herself to look cheerfully on her future as the bride of the good and venerable dr h when one fine morning aa she walks in solitary meditation in the fields a voice is heard behind her and a quick step beats the ground and an arm is put round her waist and she falls fainting in her true lovers arms instead of being drowned james marvyn has returned home rich the rest of all this pretty romance can be imagined mary acknowledges to james that he has her heart but she is nevertheless determined to keep her promiseher solemn engagement to good dr h and bids her lover not to hinder her from doing her duty there is a pause of uncertainty and suspense the awful day draws nearer but ere it has arrived a jolly little dressmaker miss prissy who acts the part of an amiable sprite all through the play informs the doctor of the state of the case the finehearted man takes all the sorrow of the position to himself surrenders the timid child he loves so dearly to the man of her choice and sets his face resolutely forward to do his duty in that unwedded life which it seems providence has designed for him  you all know he said turning to mary who sat very near him  the near and dear relation in which i have been expecting to stand towards this friend i should not have been worthy of that relation if i had not felt in my heart the true love of a husband as set forth in the new testament who should love his wife even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it and if in case any peril or danger threatened this dear girl and i could not give myself for her i had never been worthy the honour she has done me for i take it wherever there is a cross or a burden to be born by one or the other that the man who is biade in the image of god as to strength and endurance should take it upon himself and not lay it upon her that is weaker for he is therefore strong not that he may tyrannise over the weak but bear their burdens for them even as christ for his church i have just discovered he added looking kindly upon mary  that there is a great cross and burden which must come either on thia dear child or on myself through no fault of either of us but through gods good providence and therefore let me bear it mary my dear child i will be to thee as a father but i will not force thy heart this is touching and well told but how does it all square with the facts on which the story ia founded who is this good dr h this pattern minister so forgetful of himself where the happiness of others is concerned who subsequent to the declaration of independence is represented as forty years of age childless and unwived  he is no other than the celebrated samuel hopkins dd pastor of the first congregational church in newport and cofounder with jonathan edwards of that awful that indescribably ferocious system of calvinistic theology known as the hopkintonian or hopkinsian but unfortunately for the truthfulness of mrs stowes tale samuel hopkins was born in the year 1721 and did not settle in newport till the year 1770 consequently instead of being forty at the outset of his wooing which commences after the recognition of american independence by england he must be regarded as more than sixty years old but further dr hopkins married in 1748 joanna ingersol who presented him with eight children and livea with him as his wife till her death on the last day of august in 1793 and on the 14th of september 1794 the doctor then in his seventyfourth year married again taking for his second wife miss elizabeth west a lady only sixteen or seventeen years younger than himself it is a matter of certainty that samuel hopkins was in no respect such a man as mrs stow has depicted him it is true that he was an abolitionist and published in 1776 a dialogue concerning the slavery of the africans but instead of being a shiftless dreamer incapable of looking after his worldly interests and wanting a religious landlady to rouse him up and tell nim when he was hungry he was a keen and energetic man and as well able to make a bargain as any other citizen of the united states although he owned a farm and made considerable sums by his literary productions he threatened to quit his congregation at newport if they could not provide comfortably for him and mrs stow can scarcely be ignorant of how active he was in organising prayermeetings amongst his flock such misrepresentations as these altogether overstep the limits which ought to restrain the imagination of a writer of historic fiction in such composition it is allowable to exercise the imagination in amplifying and giving colour to the views of history by the creation of any series of positions and incidents which are in accordance with recorded facts but surely a too daring disregard of veracity is exhibited by though writer who professes to sketch the life of an eminent person and at the same time misrepresents it in the most important particulars what object can mrs stow have in saying that her story is founded on facts when the masterincident of the book is pure fiction are the facts of uncle toms cabin of a similar kind  other historical characters besides dr hopkins are brought on the stage but not with greater felicity col aaron burr figures away with madame de frontignac deluging that lady and all the rest of the fair sex whom he addresses with very awkward adulation but this is a slight fault and one easily accounted for doubtless it has been mrs stowes pro vince throughout life to receive rather than to pay compliments we cannot discuss at length the religious side of this novel in that respect it forms a striking contrast to the tales of miss sewell being marked by a boldness of speculation and language which one would in vain look for in the writings of our own countrywomen it is we are willing to believe written in a devout and reverential spirit but it is to be regretted that one of the saddest exhibitions of the perverseness of the human intellect when directed to the contemplation of sacred mysteries should have been dragged into a pretty love story to disfigure ana even to mar it the eicture of mrs marvyns agony on hearing of er sons death and her despair of his salvation is as revolting a spectacle of spiritual buffering as uncle tom dying under the whips of his persecutors was of bodily torture if the hook should become popular its success will be won not by its polemical qualities but by the winning graces of the heroine and her little friend of the great world verginie in the construction and elaboration of marys character genuine artistic power is manifested in conception it lacks originality for in many respects she is a combination of longfellows evangeline and that form of youngladyism which has for some years been fashionable in american novels and many features of her mind and incidents of her life have been taken with judicious selection from the numerous puritan memoirs which formed an important division of american literature in the last and few preceding generations the memoirs of mrs harriet neweu and hopkinss memoirs of miss susanna anthony who died at newport rhode island in 1791 have manifestly been carefully read by mrs stowe in conclusion we may add that amongst the pleasant peculiarities of the book are innumerable americanisms some of them intentionally and some unconsciously employed by the author to educate young ladies is to  fetch them up and a matron wno superintends her domestic servants is said  to follow them round prominent too amongst its national characteristics the reader will notice the authors passion for  talking philosophy her familiar mention of plato as  an old heathen and her anxiety to display an intimate acquaintance with the art galleries and cathedrals of europe the annoyance of our transatlantic cousins at their own want of the memorials of ancient art is one of their most patent foibles and we are not awafre that it was ever more humorously expressed than by the new york merchant who on being reminded amidst the ruins of pompeii that his country was entirely devoid of any such interesting relics answered  yes stranger thats an almighty truth we have got no remains like these here buti guess we precious soon shall have some  tiik ministers wooiv0 literature in his splendid article on milton lord macaulay did justice to our english puritans the world

  nezv chronicles of rebecca fiction by kate douglas wiggin constable 6s miss kate douglas wiggin writes of a small world but it is a very happy one where little girls with tight  braids  of flaxen hair swing chequered gingham skirts through fields of nodding poppies on their way to school and in front carrying a starspangled banner marches the redoubtable rebecca  whoever is elected president you will be rebeccayoure that kind  said one alice who knew her rebecca well and she certainly was president of whatever society she found herself in something of a marjory fleming yet entirely american in her shrewd common sense she is an attractive little personality miss wiggins  chronicles are written with the quiet humour which is her characteristic that the best of rebeccas poems does not equal the poorest by scotts immortal marjory goes without saying for she was flesh and blood while rebecca is but a very delightful literary creation but all her sayings are full of much quaint wisdom like most great souls she had her trials and we can imagine the horror of the headgear which wrung from her such verses as these wheneer i take my walks abroad how many hats ill see but if theyre trimmed with hedgehog quills theyll not belong to me  we can also share in her pain when asked to admire the following refrain at the end of each of her best friends stanzas this is my day so natal when i will follow milton,northamerica
  i shahmah in pursuit of freedom or the branded hand translated from the original shaviah and edited by an american citizen low k co shahmah the superhumanlymagnificent kabylie chief writes very much in the tone of an abolitionist pamphleteer it appears that  bis mother was a frankish woman that be was sold as a slave in algiers that he laboured as a serf in bohemia and that he went with his shaviah eyes to study united states institutions the fact seets to be that some  american citizen  has determined to hit hard at his southern countrymen and with this purpose has borrowed a turban a dialect a burnous and a fuliginous pair of mockoriental eyes shahmah is shocked in the new world by the bad manners of freedom and the wantonness of slavery  the crimson scorpion of the south is a horror to him a hundred fantastic figures play their antics upon the horizon of his philosophic view but gradually he falls in with the new orleans interests and all the stockintrade of abolitionist sympathy is brought out he visits the slavemarket he sees the shameful whippingpost  he hears the sound of the lash he  sickened by female shrieksand he is very natural and irrational in his indignation a book so obviously artificial and at the same time so elaborately melodramatic can be but of little service to the cause it proposes to champion,northamerica

lepidoptera will commend themselves to all lovers ofnature  my southern friends mr kirke proposes to narrate in this volume nothing but what he has seen and though his incidents are startling enough there is nothing improbable about them still we must receive themn with caution that excellent woman mrs c m kirkland he writes said to the author shortly after the fall of fort sumter if you cannot shoulder a musket you can blow a bugle the book before us is the bugle and the blast against slavery blown from it is very lond indeed in mr fairfaxs  elopement which we noticed in the londox revivw may 16 an attempt and not an unsuccessful one was made to show how little practical sympathy for the degro exists in the northern states but though the writer vehemently pressed his argument he was unable to conceal that while the condition of the slave in the southern states under a benevolent proprietor is far better than that of the free negro in the north nothing can be more wretched than his case if he has the misfortune to belong to a savage mrs fanny kembles residence in georgia which we reviewed in our number of the 6th of june gave us a picture of slavelife on an estate which had the reputation of being humanely managed making allowance for the colouring which a woman possessed of strong feelings and considerable eloquence could not help ging to such a subject the facts which she recounted materially affected our estimate of the creature comforts enjoyed by the slave even under a kind uster the book before us written with strong abolitionist ypathies leads us to believe that humane as mrs kembles husband may have been his estate did not resent a fair specimen of slavelife in the south when mitigate by the benevolence of the owner mr kirkes desrptio xy sother fremda by bdaund kirao autor of asu th phos low son x of the slaves on mr prestons estate shows us the northeast pbis ultra of negro happiness in the south and from the picture he has drawn of their comforts and the paternal care of their owner we are induced to believe that he has blown his bugle more in sorrow than in anaer unfortunatelyr this term  paternal care  has a double imieanimg that a man shall have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing her husbands attachment to his offspring by phyllis by parting with her trinkets kirke and preston find phyllis while she is yet in the hands of the slavetrader at a village store in north carolinah er figure was slight and graceful and her face very beautiful she bad long black glossy hair straight regular features a rich olive complexion and large lustrous eyes which as she sat opposite the open door were fixed on the thick gloomy wood with an earnest almost agonised gaze as if she were reading in its tangled depths the dark uncertain future that lay before her never shall i forget the expression of her face never have i seen its look of keen intense agony and its full perfect utter despair one of the children was a little girl of eight years with a sweet hopeful expression a clear rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons plantation near newbern here we find that prestons humanity to his slaves is ruining him and that with a hundred and fifty darkies he is going to the dogs while a certain colonel dawsey with only seventyfive works his estate at a profit preston explains how the colonel is so successfuldawsey has seventyfive slaves forty childbearing women twenty men and fifteen children under five years the sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their children and the waking rest necessary to working people he never whips them on a weekday because it wastes working time but makes sunasy a general flogging season he has two women where he has one man and each woman is expected to bear a child every second year if she doesnt she is sold they are made to work in the field till the labour pains are on them and arm allowed only two weeks res ar confinement three of them have born children in the woods this season he keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children and as soon as each child is five years oldthe ag at which it can be legay sold awra from its motherit is disposed of to the trades in addition three of these women are his mixtresse and they must bave children as fast as the others he serves their children like the rat that is rears them to the age of five and then sells them as he would so many hogs mr kirke does not confine himself to details which tell against slavery his deseption of ms preston shows how the highest womanly qualities can flourish side by side with the most hateful of social institutions she was a perfect womana faithful mistress a loving wife a devoted mother an every want of her husband rully inscting breon overseeing every detail of her oueod ueting out th red allowance of the negroes viting daily the cabins of the ad the infi d with hw own d ds u om s ing or the king m iineor whm an medin fed bedbug the lowly bd o the dyin and

writes are seen nowhere more often than in the south her husband too was solicitous for the religious wellbeing of his slaves his connexion with phyllis had terminated with his conversion to nobler thoughts and he taught his slaves their catechism and regularly attended the ministrations of the negro preacher old joe his grandfathers son by one of the old reprobates slaves side by side with the negros pitiable condition there is a vein of irresistible grotesqueness running through his life in nothing nmore remarkable than in his religious exercises joe had a rival in his clerical vocation a negro named jack whose gift was prayer and whose predilection was whisky the predilection was necessary to the full development of the rift mr kirke went to hear him open the sunday service gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment he drawled out my bredrin less us raise our hearts ter de lord the whiuce congregation then kneeled and jack closing his eyes clenching his hands together and throwing his bead back until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building  lifted up his voice and prayed  after the fashion of very many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob us dat hab come inter de worse sence hab stumbled an broke de law case he did how noah though he was a white man and had a white wife begat a black son and how that black son was a great sinner and how all his descendants have taken after him and been mighty big sinners ever since  then he described the sinner particularly the black sinners preeent and if half of what he said was tie every one of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed frank and selma to the family pew tittering laughing and flaunting their redandyellow kerchiefs the black people were enjoying themselves amazingly when  dar dey comes darm de happy pussons went round the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand before them  rosey was dressed in white with a neat fillet of pink and blue ribbon about her head and ally wore a black frockcoat with white vest and white cotton gloves one of the groomsmena rustic beau from a neighbouring plantationwore an immensely longtailed blue coat with brass buttons a flaming red waistcoat yellow woollen mittens and a neckerchief that looked like a secession flag hugging a lamppost both of these gentry had hats of stovepipe pattern very tall and with narrow bms and they wore them during the ceremony s  silence in de meetin  cried joe  the boisterous sea of black wool subsided to a dead calm those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all the responses with great propriety but some of the congregation seemed less familiar with the service when joe repeated the words if any man kin show cause why dese olks should not be lawfully jined togedder less him now speak or ele fbr eber hole his peace dinah turned to the audience and cried out yas jess less him come out wid it now rd like ter see de man dats got onyting agin it  no one

be thy welded wife then dinah unable to contain her self longer joyfully exclaimed  ob course he will any youn fellerd be glad to hab htai the ceremony is then completed and is followed by a dance in which master joe prestons son1 makes himself conspicuous as roseys partner in one of the sets for his marvellous dancing but when the young mother is confined her child is white preston to his horror discovers that his son ignorant of the girls parentage is the father overwhelmed by this shock by his wifes cruelty and extravagance and by the hopeless state of his affairs hie dies and now mrs preston learns from phylliss slave husband that selma who has all along been supposed to be prestons daughter of pure white breed is the oflfpring of his amour with phyllis the girl has received the highest education and has grown up into a wouman of surpassing loveliness mr kirke describes her appearance at the opera in boston her mother was almost white her father pure white of such parentage selma is not the only issue famed for extraordinary beauty and now comes the crowning interest of the story selina is bought by her brother joe but frankan adopted son of mr kirkes and the illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread

  patience sparhawk and her times by gertrude atherton 65 lane try to conceive  the story of an african farm 0 without its passion for morality and you will get some idea of mrs athertons new book it is the novel of a clever woman of overflowing energy and burning interest in life but it is terribly crude and to european eyes terribly solemn with the aggressive solemnity of youth primarily it is a protest against the tame american novel and a claim that the people of the united states are very independent in ideals and conduct and very much themselves patience is a defiant portrait of a defiant woman to the mere reader she is a conceited badtempered and vulgar person a not unnatural product of a shocking bringing up but her creator proudly shows her with the manhood of new york at her feet paying her outrageously illbred compliments the refreshing thing about patience is her strong belief in the sanitary influence of brains which have been rather underrated by heroines of her order in recent fiction mrs atherton we are sure is not her apologist she likes her just sodefiant rasping grasping flattery and powerperhaps wishes she were worse but seeing she is neither exemplary nor charming a reader who cares more for general human nature than for any temporary phase of the american woman will ask what is the good of her to him her career is spasmodically interesting the society scenes we cannot accept as true to life but her experience among the temperance women and the newspaper men are at least very lively as a story however we own our real interest was first roused when bourke on his engine was racing the new york express with the confession which was to save patience from a criminals death in the electrical chair altogether it is a book that interests us more in its writer than in itself all the characters who have anything to say talk essays by this means mrs atherton has got rid of much matter weighing on her mind and so presumably she will move along more swimmingly next time  fiction patience sparhawk and her times by n gertrude atherton john lane dubing these two or three years certain social sketches published in vanity fair over the signature of mrs atherton have indicated the settlement in our midst of an american writer of much promise now comes the novel it cannot be denied that upon the whole the promise is fulfilled in one of its many aspects the book invites and indeed deserves ridicule it is ridiculous as the embodiment of mrs athertons philosophical proposition about the women of america these dames and damsels may really be struggling to be free from the conventions which keep society decent and girlhood charming but we cannot believe that they will ever as a class settle down into the humourless hetairism in which practically all the characters of this book spend the mid period of the romance mrs athertons philosophy of the american woman need not however trouble us long it springs from an excess of zeal and may be overlooked the story itself is fresh and arresting patience sparhawk is at school when we make her acquaintance her father is dead and her mother is given to drink and wantoning and young as she is patience who has a sensitive soul is bitterly at issue with the world dreary this state of affairs undoubtedly is but it is treated with extraordinary skill so keenly sympathetic is mrs athertons study of the strange rural life in america that we follow her for many chapters with a very unusual interest her perceptions are acute and her reflections are extraordinarily well phrased nor does the work fall off when having tried to kill her mother patience leaves home for the great city there she is taken charge of by two maiden relations whose evangelical activities george eliot herself could scarce have depicted with finer art meanwhile patience has been developing her spanish nature has blossomed into a critical reticent hauteur and she has become beautiful there ends mrs athertons essay in real literature the lovemaking and the wedlocks which follow will not bear examination the book reveals an unusual perspicacity as regards women but mrs athertons men are not good with the exception of the two editors under whose joint auspices patience becomes a  newspaper woman the male characters in the book are unnatural finally being suspected of having poisoned her husband patience is condemned to death thereupon the novelist finds her proper pace again and the pace is rapid times without record the same situation has been made use of by sensational writers but we should be surprised to learn that it has ever been more effectively treated than it is in this novel the narrative flies before our eyes as fast as the special ttain which is bearing the reprieve and a new lover to the gaol in which the heroine is about to be  electrocuted it is not literature of a high kind  but such ns it is it is brilliant,northamerica

  old rabbit the voodoo and other sorcerers by mary alicia owen fisher unwin  brother what a great deal of tea you do drink said the sister while handing him his fourteenth cup of weak tea  sister what a great deal of water you make mo drink in order to get a little tea  was his answer and it comes to our mind while reading this collection of stories it has mr leland says in the preface not been  made on the grimm principle of  pleasing tales for the nursery it is startling to hear that the brothers grimm had the nursery in their minds when they set the stone of collecting folktales rolling but it is manifest that miss owen cannot have had it in hers for except in an american not to say a missourinursery her book will be almost unintelligible some words are obscure even to grownup people and it is hard to have to toil through so much negroenglish before we can enjoy the items of true folklore earnest clear and welldefined that are promised by mr leland the promise is fulfilled there is a great deal of valuable folklore in the stories but it is injured not only by the uncouth dialect but by being laboriously introduced into the conversation of five negresses and one child who draws thenout one negress is from ole feginney another was bornded in tennisee but mosly brung up in mizzoury  a third has a french father a fourth a fox indian while the fifth aunt mymee is spoken of as the only pureblooded african of the group an african sorceress is indeed her mother but she is anxious to have it generally understood that her other parent was the devil she is acquainted with the mysteries of voodooism and can trick men and beasts and to trick in negroenglish means more than in english proper she lays  a turrble trick  on some dogs but explains that it is

of her associates miss owen who has we are told been initiated sufficiently into the mysteries of voodooism to divine its full scope and nature means to give her knowledge to the world at some future time that being the case she does not give so much of it now as we should like but what she does give is most interesting aunt mymee has a luckball which she believes contains her soul as well as her luck she calls it by her own name and bathes it in whiskey once a week to preserve its strength full directions are given for the making wearing and treatment of a luckball it is a thing or a being

fisher unwin this quaint volume is from the pen of the southern lady whose paper on  missourinegro folklore was one of the good things at the folklore congress of 1891 she now appears in the guise of the flaxenhaired listener irreverently dubbed towhead for whose benefit a remarkable group of black women pour out their treasures of ancient fable the form and method of the book recall of course uncle pe mus but the likeness stops there considered as humorous literature old rabbit cannot perhaps rank with the masterpiece of  joel chandler harris   but from the point of view of the folklorist it has a far higher value both are collections of  animal myths founded on widespread and immemorial traditions with many modern glosses derived from misunderstood phenomena and adorned with detail varying with the different races by whom they have been handed down but whereas uncle remus is saturated with the modern plantation nigger in miss owens book the bed indian medicine man is predominant and there is also a considerable tincture of the aboriginal african witchdoctor the stories here set down for us come from the missouri border where there is a large black population of mixed indian and negro blood a blend which not only has an individual flavour of its own but seems to have preserved certain voodoo elements not generally met with in the states about voodooism we know comparatively little but no doubt as mr leland tells us in his preface it is distinguished from aryan and also from red indian magic by its reliance not so much on penance and invocation as  on daring what is horrible and repulsive the discrimination of these different elements in miss owens stories is an engaging task for the reader who will also notice the considerable literary skill she shows both in the telling of the stories and in the portraits of those who tell them a the voodoo king if a slightly revolting and simian personage is typical and the black sibyls who foregather in the cottage of granny are admirably distinct in character speech and appearance chief of them is granny herself devoted to  the folks at the house whose slave she once was who claims to be a descendant of

for i have so many lations and only had just that one sweet kitty there is a whole series of rabbit stories usually funny though containing nothing quite equal to the tarbaby episode in which uncle remuss chartered libertine so nearly gets his  comeuppence we would call particular attention to this among other new and delightful words by which the blacks vocabulary is richer than the whites the rabbit with miss owen is much more of a magician much less an incarnation of the nigger than with  joel chandler harris  and a similar distinction is noticeable between the bird and reptile personages in the two collections chief among the birds is of course the woodpecker who was a very early bird at magical work for did not picus martius take romulus and remus from the month the umbrian augurs knew him well and in the eugubine tables we find the directions parfa kurnase dersua peiqu peica merstu by interpretation of prof donaldson  parram cornicem dextras picum picam simistros and it is noticeable that it is about these same birds that miss owens clients have most to tell us her woodpecker is however a far greater personage than the classical picus the king turned into a bird because he declined to serve a witchs sensual phantasy he is lord of the woods the greatest of all the magicians he makes the bat out of a mouse and a goatsucker and gives the redbird his gay plumage and endows his friends with all the good fortune and all the moral excellences that pallas and hera offered to paris perhaps this redheaded bird with his weird laughing cry the peculiar mimicry of his plumage and his curious exploratory methods of feeding is to be identified with the redcap goblins found all over europe but there is a vast difference between the treasureseeking folletto coila beretta of europe and the great sorcerer of the american continent perhaps the most curious passage in old rabbit is that in which the authoress describes the manufacture of a luckball price one

  thc good time coming by tsarthur hodg sonthis is a good and useful story but told in a style of mawkish sentimentalism which would always be in bad taste but it bas also gone by as completely as the shepherd and shepherdess figures of speech in which our greatgrandmothersall hoops and whaleboneespecially delighted the moral of the good time is very well brought out and in spite of the style the story deserves to be read  a good time coming by the author of mathew paxton 3 vols hurst and blackett this is a hearty lancashire tale of men and masters not only of a good time coming but at last also of a good time come  and of the energy and kindliness of common feeling that learned how they could live the bad times down and get prosperity out of adversity good out of evil the author understands lancashire life and appears sometimes to hover about existing things and people it was impossible perhaps to be in earnest and not do so,northamerica
  the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,northamerica
  other new books highways axd byways by inglis allen constable 3s od the genesis of these short sketches of mr allens is by mr pelt ridge out of  punch for they are mainly gathered from the pages of punch and while it would be unfair to assert that mr allen is an imitator of mr ridge it is impossible to dissociate him from the school of that master of tramcar model dwelling southeastern suburban dialogue here we have sevenandtwenty sketches of life as it is seen by those who get their beer in by the jug with the added distortion of the sjrson who looks at such life through the eyes of culture ut the sketches are funnyof that there can be no questionthough we may doubt if the originals could recognise their voices or their faces mr allen gives us swift little sketches of the auction room coronation night a policecourt witness the suburban train and so forth one only we select for special notice as typical of the rest the maternal instinct the story is well and simply done a tramcar at nightfull in it a stout and exhilarated woman a nervous young man and an elderly female with no children of her own strangers all to the young maus stare the stout woman returns in kind   all right bertie she remarks defiantly  yer neednt look at me so oldfashioned the young man scared at the sudden publicity thus thrown upon him reddens and looks away but the elderly female next to him champions him immediately and why shouldnt e look oldfashioned she returns sturdily  if e ts oldfashioned   this is a startler for though stout lady though urbanity of her expression vanishes immediately and she directs a cold stare at the elderly female  i wasnt speakin to you at all she observes with dignity  i was speakin to that gentleman  an i answered for im returns the elderly female cheerfully  because im is mother the story is amusing as are all the rest but they must be taken piecemeal if weariness is to be avoided this is but a mere confession of human weakness no one we think could read even mr ansteys  voces populi straight through without tiring at the constant change of focus  highways and byways in dorset bv sir frederick treves with illbstrations by joseph pennell 6s macmillan if you are acquainted with the vivid and sharply realistic prose etchings in that charming book of travel  the other side of the lantern you will know what to expect of sir frederick treves when you come to read what he has written of highways and byways in dorset it was no light matter to add a new and adequate volume to a series that has reached and maintained such a high level of literary and artistic excellence but sir frederick treves and mir joseph pennell have accomplished their undertaking with conspicuous success other counties may have more in them of antiquarian and historical interest but no county included in this series can well have had more of interest got out of it than sir frederick treves has got out of dorset his pages are coloured with stories and little impressionistic wordpictures of dorsetshire worthies such as fielding the novelist william barnes the poet thomas mlasterman hardy nelsons captain old thomas fuller sir walter raleigh and to name no others thomas hardy who has put so much of dorset scenery and character into his novels and whose birthplace is pointed out at upper bockingham  an ancient cottage almost hidden from sight by the bushes of its old garden on the one hand and by the slope of the downs on the other also these pages are rich in rumours and remembrances of old wars and glamorous romantic happenings you have glimpses of king charles lying hidden at charmouth after the flight from worcester of monmouth fleeing along the secluded lanes after the rout of sedgemoor of the tragic progress of jeffreys and the bloody assize all the story of what dorset has been mingling with the story of what it is now and then sir frederick strikes a more personal note when he touches in recollections such as those of his own boyhood at west lulworth a picturesque hamlet of thatched cottages with a mumbling old mill in the days when he sat in the church of sundays and was too small to see anvthing over the top of the high pew but could hear the orchestra in the gallery  a violin a bass viol a flute and an instrument called i believe a serpent lightly and picturesquely written full of

nottinghamshire than that they are excellent with the charm and delicacy of finish that always characterise his work froon highways and byways in nottinghamshire lacniill1a houses in the poultry nottingham  highways and byways in literature by hugh farrie i williams and norgate 5s highways and byways  is a scrap hook a most comprehensive miscellany of very short and not very profound papers mr farrie has touched upon an amazing number of subjects of general and peculiar interest and he has not adorned them he cannot deal greatly with a great subject and his thoughts on homer sappho socrates and dante are not worth considering it is frivolous to say of dante that  all the evidence internal and external proves the vita nuova to be a pretty artistic experiment to begin with intense passion is rarely articulate and the passion which expresses itself in sonnets accompanied by an epexegetic commentary is incomprehensible but in dealing in a small way with a small subjectin the section that is given over to forgotten bookshe can continue to be very entertaining how many people today read christopher christian sturms absurd  reflections for every day in the year on the works of god which saw the light in 1775 and had a vogud much longer and considerably wider than the most successful novels of modern times have obtained or are likely to obtain it was translated into french english dutch danish and swedish the philosophy of sturm tends to the conviction that man exists under the best of all possible conditions and he expresses a devout thankfulness for the presence of fertilising saltpetre in snow one of the most amusing paragraphs relates an ingenious calculation of the number of risen bodies that will be present at the general resurrection sturm takes an average of the yearly number of deaths in the town of hamburg from the date of the flood then by a bold speculation as to the date of the millennium he is able to continue his average to the end of time all that remains to be done is to express a proportion between the number of inhabitants of hamburg and the number of inhabitants of the world and sturm is able to inform us that the total sum of human beings who will be present on the occasion referred to amounts to one hundred and ten thousand three hundred and seventyfive millions nothing could be more convincing,northamerica
  the traitors by e phillips oppenheim ward lock  co there is something eminently satisfactory about mr oppenheim as a novelist for he knows exactly what sort of a story he has to tell and he knows how to tell it he has at his command an abundance of fine sensational matter and as he uses it with a strict and skilful regard for the best entertainment of his readers his romances are usually effective it is hardly an exaggeration to say of  the traitors  that its interest begins on the first page and continues to the last the plot is ingenious and well managed the movement of the story is admiralty swift and smooth and the characters though by no means deep or complicated are at all events exceedingly vivacious the tale is pseudohistorical and thus obtains that glamour which hangs about great events and high personages of uncertain identity its scene of action is theos  a country which we suspect is situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of buritaniaand what with a revolution the recall of an exiled king a war with turkey and various political intrigues of a dramatic nature the readers excitement is kept on the stretch to the very end,northamerica

  j go afishing by w c prime low co why peter went afishing the title of the opening chapter of this volume led us to believe that we had come across a serious book further on we met with signs of having fallen in with a modern izaak walton mingling maxims on angling with others on simple worldly philosophy now and then we listen to a story sometimes grave sometimes gay generally gracefully told and with or without a purpose in short mr prime has gone a fishing in order to catch a public he no doubt will hook a good many readers and safely land some we have only to add that his industry and his art merit all the profit he can acquire by the use he has made of them the volume is  de omnibus rebus and as many besides as ingenuity could pack into it the dialogues are kept up by various interlocutors and there is smartness in some good sense in others and occasionally commonplaces in both here is an example of the criticism of these anglers and companions one is reading aloud after a days sport the dies ira in which the following stanza occurs lacrymosa dies illa qua resurget ex favilla judicandus homo reus  huic ergo paree deua  the  ergo  is objected to as a  senseless word referring to nothing but to which strength and meaning can be given by simply changing qua in the second line to qua3 when the lines would signify oh that mournful day what shall arise out of the ashes  guilty man to be judged him therefore spare oh god  improving an unimprovable stanza after this fashion reminds one of the great personage who in pinching the nose of the dead alexander to give it seemliness found it crumble to dust under the touch on another occasion the doctor pronounces a line in another mediaeval rhyme to be a superb line it consists of the words  vale immunde munde the critic would therefore find beauty in ciceros alleged attempt at poetry oh fortunatam natam me consule romam would find much to extol in the epitaph on rosamund  rosa mundi non rosa munda and be ecstatic over the wellknown riddling fines on proculus who was killed by the bell of the church of st proculus falling on him on his grave in the churchyard these lines were to be seen perhaps  si procul a proculo proculi campana fuirset ip8e foret proculus nunc procul a proculo while the doctor displays as above his taste for poetry steenburger thus illustrates his philosophy    strange isnt it that so many men are known who ought to be unknown and so many are unknown that one would give all his old boots to know  it is not however the philosophy or the reflections in this volume which will attract general readers so much as the experiences of fishing and shooting which are told with the best effect for example  it is safe to be always ready to lose a fish nor have i ever known a more remarkable loss than occurred to me still later on that day frank had followed down the bank of the river and i had twice given him my full basket to empty after the second emptying the first tish which i took i put in it a threequarter pounder and standing on a fallen tree six feet above the stream cast below over a deep hole and as i cast saw this fishs head coming out of the receiving hole in the top of the basket before my left hand could reach him a flap of his tail sent him like a shot into the air before my eyes and he vanished in the pool below me john said i after that i am going home a solitary fish standing up on his tail and putting his head out of the hole in a twelvepound creel is a wonderful sight and means something let us be superstitious for once and stop work there must be compensation for losing a fish in shooting a deer under discouraging circumstances  i used to think that a deer was one of the most foolish of animals for he will even stand and look steadily at a man as long as the man is motionless but almost at the wink of an eye surely at the slightest movement of a head or hand he is away imagine the scene as we moved across the lake in the gloaming for it was past sunset of a rainy evening and tell me if that buck was not exceedingly stupid for an animal supposed to be timid beyond all others i was in the extreme bow a white statue i folded my arms cautiously at the start to cover even my hands john and the boat were out of sight behind me and the paddle was invisible and noiseless as we shot across the lake he was feeding on the grass on the edge of the water standing broadside to us with his head down at fifty rods distance he raised his head and saw us stretching up his long neck and turning his head full at us he stared in astonishment at first curiosity next satisfaction at last for the paddle had stopped and he only looked at a motionless white mass which resembled nothing he ever saw before as soon as he began to feed again we advanced swiftly some fifteen or twenty rods when he lifted his head again and again seemed lost in wonderment we were not more than thirty rods off and as he looked at me i looked at him for full two minutes but though i could see his eyes he clearly failed to see mine if he had ever been in the vatican gallery he would have recognised the queer object before him it resembled nothing so much as a herculean torso without arms of old marble a little yellowed by earth and age certainly he had never before seen a man in a white rubber coat for at length he went to feeding again now john sent his paddle into the water ten or a dozen sharp strokes and up went the head again to look at us but the bow of the boat swerved just enough to let john shoot over my left and at the instant the rifle cracked down went the buck dead at the fall i never saw a deer fall more suddenly after that i advised sportsmen to paddle up to deer with white rubber coats on we give one example of the many legends narrated in the book most of which show much power of memory perhaps also of imagination on the part of the narrator   i once asked a learned mohammedan in egypt whether he believed that women would go to heaven for it is an error to think that houries are mere women and what he thought of the prophets saying that there are no old women there he replied giving what is i believe the orthodox creed of islam that women will be saved like men and will all be made young againexcept one woman and her story is somewhat interesting when joseph wa3 viceroy in egypt he was riding out one day near memphis and an old woman seizing him by the knee demanded charity he turned to look at her and was so shocked at her appearance that he involuntarily exclaimed how terribly homely you are then why dont you pray to your god who answers all your prayers and ask him to make me beautiful  whereupon joseph lifted up his hands and prayed for her and instantly beheld her standing by him young and lovely so lovely that he loved her and made her his wife and she grew old and died long after him and went to heaven and is an old woman there and the only old woman in heaven for god makes all good women young again once but only once and she can never be made young again an egyptian village perpetuates in its name badrashain the story of this wife of joseph we are a little inclined to ascribe this story to the prolific author known as ben trovato and we are disposed to ask if  badrashain is not a corrupt form of the irish word bathershin however this may be the book taken altogether is a good book for an occasional halfhours reading in this way it may be perused with pleasure to the end it is to be praised too for its frankness at whatever cost mr prime not only declares that he loves to go afishing but confesses that he is not troubled with the thought of what the fish may think or feel about it if the fish is in pain so much the worse for the fish on the other hand there is a certain lady whose horse he would ride through flames to the killing of the steed and with safety to the rider rather than that certain lady should feel a single pain  fish were made to feel but if a certain lady be not exempted why then there is something wrong in creation,northamerica

  a face illumined by rev e p roe i vo london ward lock and coa face illumined is to be commended inasmuch as the author writes with a good moral purpose at heart and expresses himself in wellchosen language a perusal of the book is sufficient to make it apparent that the author has a high standard of what a novel ought to be but it is far from apparent that he has attained his end mr roe has been very happy in his title an artist sees a pretty face unillumined by cither thought or feeling and resolves to illumine it with both he ultimately succeeds in doing so and in making thc owner of the pretty face his wife this is the plot in a nutshell the characters are american  the scene is on the hudson  andmr rec judging from where he writes his prefacecornwallonthchudson  is an american the novel decidedly loses in interest from the sameness of place and the paucity of incidents mr roes grasp of human character is limited onesided and fragmentary,northamerica
  the days of old lang syne the days of old lang syne  is the complement not the supplement much less the sequel to beside the bonnie brier bush the scene is indeed the same the cast is substantially the old drumtochty onewith however lachlan campbell and donald menzies left out of the action of the piece though evidently looking on lovingly at the wings and ready as wellcoached understudies to rush in and do their best should hillocks or burnbrae or the redoubtable drumsheugh himself break down but the new play is essentially lay and mundane there are in it no seventh heaven raptures transfigurations or sermontastings a second reading of the book has left me in doubt as to whether there is any free kirk or any dissent worth speaking of in drumtochty there is burnbrae to be sure who would rather leave his farm than be disloyal to his disruption creed but even burnbrae   the days of old lang syne by ian macaren london llomer and stoughton 1895 is a man of strong common sense as well as of earnest conviction in another epoch he would probably have fought at irumclog and certainly at dunkeld though i should think not at ayrsmoss he was of the stock of whom burns in spite of his moderatismthe burns by the way of fact not of allan cunninghamwrote 1the solemn league and covenant now brings a smile now brings a tear but sacred freedom too was theirs if thourt a slave indulge

soldiers conception of loyalty to duty besides all through  the days of old lang syne hillocks bumbrae soutar drumsheugh and all the rest including even the doctor are thinking less of their ministers texts sermons and experiences than of such completely terrestrial concerns as sales crops leases weather and oldbut not coldloves  beside the bonnie brier bush gave us the firstdayintheweek drumtochty in  the days of old lang syne  we have the parish as it is six days in seven and the most of whose inhabitants are good churchmenor free churchmen as the case may bewhose  religion in common life  finds expression in silent action even more than in family worship it is perhaps because drumtochty in its weekday clothes is more difficult of adequate portraiture than drumtochty in its sunday best that i consider ian maclarens new book a distinct advance on its predecessor i think the transfiguration of donald menzies in  beside the bonnie brier bush  trembles on the verge of unreality and that the holder of the macwhammel scholarship would have been truer to life not to speak of conscience had he preached his new learning sermon semitic environment and allrather than have acted in the possibly beautiful and certainly carlylean way he did even although he thereby pleased his aunt and the spirit of his mother here i find no unrealityalthough there is abundance of what mr arnold in his ignorance of the depths of scottish nature termed  intolerable pathos not even in the little tragedy of the servantgirl who went to london or in the loves of the close drumsheugh and the nippytongued jamie soutar and this makes me hasten to say that while there is almost no spirituality there is a great deal of emotion in  the days of old lang syne that emotion overflows its banks as often as the tochty as a matter of fact ian maclaren while obviouslynever more obviously than in his new booka humourist by nature is a sentimentalist by mission that is to say he has set himself deliberately to lay bare the recesses of simple scottish tenderness and love to oppose these realities to the socalled realism of the rougonmacquart horrors andalas that one should have to say so of the wessex of  jude the obscure and that he has succeeded is beyond doubt in the death of lily grant in  a servant lass  the author is seen at his very bestbetter than in the death of the  lad o pairts which is to me a trifle too  exalted or in the death of maclure which is too long drawn out jamie soutar plays many parts excellently in this book but his intrusion into  a servant lass preventing it from becoming too depressingly sad is perfect ian maclaren is not always it is true up to the mark of  a servant lass drumsheughs lovesecret is too long and too elaborately sustained i for one should have preferred him to remain a consistent curmudgeon to the end instead of turning out a pilgrim of love in disguise but above all things excess of an essentially optimistic sentimentalism has induced him to make the one blunder of his new book to pen the almost maudlin last chapter ian maclaren can in most respects stand comparison with mr barrie but his oor lang hame can only be contrasted and unfavourably for its author with the return of the  son from london  in  a window in thrums which appears to have suggested it the appearance of this son in thrums as a pariah the agonies of his conscience the little touches of neighbourly kindliness which ought to temper the boycotting of him as a moral leper by his old friends but which in reality only add to its pangs his return to london presumably to make a dreary best of it with  the woman who has played the devil with his life these constitute the most awful piece of real for being moral it is real scottish tragedy that has ever been published compared with the return of jamie mcquhumpha to thrums that of chairlie grant to drumtochty to drumsheughs heart andhad that been necessaryto drumsheughs chequebook seems flat and almost poor if ian maclaren is a sentimentalist of set and almost scientific purpose he is a humourist by nature if  beside the bonnie brier bush  indicated this in unmistakable fashion  the days of old lang syne places the fact beyond all question what is more it demonstrates the variety as well as the quality of its authors humour when he keeps it free from emotion as he does entirely in a triumph of diplomacy and almost entirely in  good news from a far country and in the  nippy tongue  section of jamie soutars history he comes nearer to galt than any of his contemporaries mr barrie himself not excepted i have said that a servant lass  is ian maclarens high water mark as yet but for pure and dry but not ungenial drollery there is nothing in this volume or in its predecessor to match hillocks ingenious devices to secure the renewal of his lease on good terms or the successful efforts of the drumtochty worthies to magnify their professor in a far country who happily does not die like 1 omsie jamie soutars hits as at the cockney temperance lecturer and the too confident evangelical preacher are delicious his end is perhaps a trifle overdone and suggests the mendacious captain in  peter simple who affirms with his last gasp that he has known a man live with the deathrattle in his throat for six weeks but it is eminently quotable and dean

best and most toughly scottish character of the carl hemp order mr watson has yet drawnfull of the national pride as well as the national humour prone to small sinning in the way of an occasional dram but fiercely  independent in his sinning withal tender and as his death shows capable of giving away his life  past redemption  is not so perfectly artistic as  a servant lass but it is a very good second whether or not it be true as rumour has it that ian maclaren has said goodbye to drumtochty he has in hillocks jamie soutar domsie burnbrae posty and drum sheugh at all events drumsheugh before

  caleb west master diver by f hopkinoua smith 6s a conmtable sad co there is a frank naturalness about this story which we have found particularly attractive the characters are thoroughly human they speak and act like living people and secure the mr f hopiunson smith readers friendship from the first caleb west is a strong ad interesting character but there is a burlychested bighearted old seadog known as captain joe whom we prefer even to the diver there is something invigorating and refreshing in the briny atmosphere which he brings with him everywhere the young civil engineer too is an entirely satisfactory type of man clever sensible and honestly human a capital busneas man where lighthouse building is concerned a loyal and honourable gentleman in his friendship with mrs leroy in fact all the characters are good the details of engineering work are interesting the style is bzight and effective the writer is to be congratulated on his work  caleb west master diver by f hopkinson smith constable  cothis is a very typical american novel of the kind which is not by one of the few firstrate writers on the other side it shows a society full of young enthusiasms always eager to resolve fresh problems and looking on life as something new requiring investigation and not yet cut and dried these characteristics are what generally make even the worst american novel worth looking at as it may suggest some original way of looking at life but these novels have also the inevitable fault of a youthful literary societys work  they have little style and little sense of proportion the author is apt to be so interested in his own ideas that he forgets to rivet his readers attention by the unity of his story now caleb west is by no means a bad novel it is full of interesting matter and it has a subtlety of observation and a delicacy in characterdrawing rarely found in any but the best english novels  but as a consecutive story it is hopeless the account of the building of the lighthouse is most interesting even exciting but it has no more real connexion with calebs love tragedy or mrs leroys fine character than the account of a gold mine or a savage raid would have mrs leroy is indeed disappointing dramatically there is just enough of her tragedy outlined to attract intensely without satisfying the reader  the suggestiveness of it is so subtle as to be elusive nevertheless  caleb west is an interesting book and if the author would study form more he could write excellent novels  caleb west master diver by f hopkinson smith constable  co one seems to seo though evolution of this story very plainly though author is a culturod amiablo gentleman with literary tastes and some skill let me seo what shall my novol be about he asked himself  technical fiction is popular kiplings captains courageous pleased people a good deal ill bo technical too lighthouse building hasnt been done ill do that a description of how foundationstones are laid under though water should go well and for human interest well givo the diver a young wife who shall elope with one of the workmen and the chief engineer shall have artistic tastes and be loved by a new york society woman and it was done and the result is an agreeable and utterly unimportant story and we hope that the author does not talk about the inevitableness of his art hero is a passage   these breathing spells rest the lungs of a diver and lighten his work being at rest he can manage his dress the better inflating it so that he is able to get his air with greater ease and regularity the relief is sometimes so soothing that in long waits the droning of the airvalve will lull the diver into a sleep from which he is suddenly awakened by a quick jerk on his wrist many divers while waiting for the movements of those above play with the fish watch the crabs or rake over the gravel in search of the thousand and one things that are lost overboard and that everybody hopes to find on the bottom of the sea caleb did none of these things he was too expert a diver to allow himself to go to sleep and he had too much to think about to play with the fish he sat quietly awaiting his call his thoughts onthe day of the week and how long it would bo before saturday night came again and whether when he left that morning he had arranged everything for the little wife so that she would bo comfortable until his return once a lobster moved slowly up and nipped his red fingers with its claw thinking them some tidbit previously unknown the dress terminates at though wrist with a waterproof and airtight band leaving the hands bare at another time two tomcods came sailing past side by side flapped their tails on his helmet and scampered off but caleb sitting comfortably on his sofacushion of seaweed thirty feet under water paid little heed to outside things his eyes only saw a tossing apron and a trim little figure on a cabin porch as she waved him a labt goodbye according to the new york bookmans cables caleb west is very popular all over amorica it is a pleasant story enough and people might do much worse than read it but it is machine made from first pago to last it is not fit

  the spoilers by edwin pugh newnes 6s having read about half mr pughs book just before going to bed we passed a wretched night before the next day was out we had read the rest and slept soundly for if he tells us exactly how the next burglar will enter our house he tells us later by how simple and cheap a contrivance we can be sure that we hear him when he does indeed we are not sure that so thorough a knowledge of burglars and their ways must not be held to imply a misspent youth surely practical experience alone but there is a law of libel and we must hold our hand  hastening to assure mr pugh that if he forces us to suspect him of having been a burglar he forces us also to acknowledge him a very able novelist his story suggests in some ways  oliver twist here is bill sikes chick marketer here is nancy judith and here is fagin bill fix but here emphatically is not oliver mr pugh has a boy indeeddeuce marketer by name  but he is such a real boy such an absolute boy so full of actuality and life and  the real thing that we must apologise for mentioning him in the same breath with that bloodless little prig oliver perhaps miss porch and mr gandy are a little dickensy but they are genuine enough and fill a necessary place in a story that has turn and turn about thrilled us with dread and pity and set us laughing aloud with its natural inevitable humour the spoilers is a capital book  the spoilers by edwin pugh newnes in this curious and clever novel mr pugh has sought to combine uncompromising realism with a kind of genial humorous sentimental caricature of life upon the whole the story is successful but its success is rather despite than because of the combination referred to the book would have been better without the sections of dickensiana which are inserted among genuine studies of the netherworld of london  and that because the first named are not realthey are fustian pinchbeck a careful imitation on his central character a newly released convict on ticketofleave who takes up his abode with an old  fence and steals the affections of a girl who is engaged to a preacher and reformed thiefa careful and exact studythe author is to be congratulated the exconvicts adventures are unsavoury in the extreme but the sketch of the man is interesting because it is absolutely real there is not much art in the volume mr pughs literary judgement is faulty and he is weak in construction but there is vivid photography the authors stock of thieves slang is notable there is no makebelieve in mr pughs handling of his really lowclass characters and so his book is worth reading particularly for the student of london,northamerica
  northeast wigwam and the cabin second series by w g simms wiley and putnam london this is a very curious and interesting volume of tales told with rough vigour very characteristic of the subject the first  the giants coffin or the feud of holt and houston is a genuine border narrative with all the terrible features which belong to such tales sergeant barnacle or the raftsman of the edisto is perhaps as terrible a story as any we ever read it is painful in the extreme in the first we have the fate of a brutal husband pictured with startling fidelityin the second the awful retribution of god by the hand of man upon a seducer it is like a nightmare but it is good  which is the madman  the lazy crow and lucas de ayllon are clever but caloya or the loves of the driver is a gem we never read a better told story though it has faults referred to by the author himself  i have but a single word to deliver in regard to this little volume i am consciousin one at least of the stories in the ensuing collectionthat entitled caloys or the loves of the driverof a certain flemish freedom of touch which in the minds of very fastidious persons may subject me to a certain degree of censure the materials are coarse in character delineating the negro slave in his moments of excess and the indian in his condition of deepest degradation it has not been without a purpose that i have so designed it since i am free to believe that i have succeeded in showing how happily virtue can be seen to triumph even in the worst estates and with what loveliness of aspect purity can make her progress like the lady in miltons comus even through the foul rabble of lewd spirits that hang about her path i flatter myself that in this little story i have wrought out the most healthful and encouraging results of virtue even from an atmosphere wholly vicious and impure and that the indian woman caloya is in moral respects such a being as might serve for the model of the purest lady in the land  the wigwam

  v martins summtr by shirley smitei author of h1 is last stake c c hurst and blackett this very readable novel is in several strata beginning thirty years ago it introduces us to a set of pleasant young people in whlosc fortunes wc become intcrested and when in the course of events some of thee arc matrimonially disposed of and others apparently left on the shelf wc take a fresh start with a new generation of heroes and heroines we suppose that thc part of a  leading lady must be allowed to belong to catherine courtenay who certainly takes hold upon our sympathies from the first when it is declared that  at fifteen she was not a precxious hoyden with untitly hair and a flippant tongue neither wa she an adept in any of the newfangled modes of flirtation thc chicf of which is that the woman kindly takes all the trouble of thc courtship off the hands of the man it must however be pxinted out that the  cometh up as a flower  and  comin thro the rye type of girl had hardly a licensed existence at thc date when this story opens and therefore the abstinence of miss courtcay from slovenlincss slang and pronounced love inaking is less remarkable than if she had been a product of the present lay the evil genius of catherines existence is a disreputable brother who blights his own prospects and his sisters life by committing a forgery disappearing for a few years only to retuirn when his presence will create the greatest embarrass mnent by the process of misunderstanding so well known to fiction the somewhat dilatory lover who has just made up his mind to propose is led to believe that the unlucky brother is his rival and goes off piqued and chilled and ready to fall a prey to an extremely beautiful but evilhearted woman who is attracted by his rentroll selfish soulless

possession of a small property and a pretty hiousc near the cathedral town of w  another heroine now comes on the scene and in describing her the author again deals a sideblow at prevalent heresies in art and manners lora roland in the sweet freshness of her youth with brilliant beauty of face and unstudied grace of form was a living protest against the bold attempts now being made to thrust repulsive ugliness upon us as the highest form of art would these latter lay sjoilers and libellers of the divine gift of beauty have dared to tell any man that to make dora really lovely all her brilliant colouring should be washed away that the beaming eyes should become lustreless and full of unutterable woe and the soft outlines of her form lean lank and haggard as if the fresh pure air of heaven had never been breathed into the cramped lungs or nourishing food tasted by the pallid lips but happily in spite of paint and powder horrible cosmetics and abominable hair dyes in spite of the lath and plaster so liberally used to hide the deficiencies of nature and in spite of the new crusade preached by a few fanatics against the beauty of youth and health and vivid coloring we have still

constant but still endowed with good looks persuades her to take pity on his loneliness and to believe that although midsummer be over and autumn close at handteforc dreary winter sets in there is st martins summer the sweetest season of the year in this bare outline we have made no mention of the numerous secondary characters who agreeably fill the pages of the story the episode of louise courtenay the young lady of advanced opinions who tried hard to be a strongminded woman but was ignominiously converted to a more commonplace destiny is decidedly amusing and welltold it must however be objected that both social and artistic theories are considerably antedated that it is not the cant of fiveandtwenty years ago which is aptly signalised in the title of a jamphlet on the manysidedness of the moral idea in connexion with the gymnastics and music of ancient greece or the taste of that epoch which was characterised by black ceilings greygreen dados and fifteenth century chairs and tables it is a pity that those chapters are not transplanted to the latter portion of the book where they might figure with more verisimilitude it may also be noted that mr ruthven could hardly have come to w as the  bishops curate  and that although the notion of an archdeacon whispering soft nothings in a curly hat and gaiters is entertaining enough it must be looked upon as rather a glaring abuse of episcopal patronage when wsc find this dignitary a goodlooking young man with dark curling hair to be the bishops eldest son he is evidently an archdeacon unattached for we discover that his spiritual functions arc exercised at a fashionable proprietary chapel in london where exquisite masses are sung morning and erjixg under the presidency of the seductive archdeacon who acts as impresarso to this attractive sunday popular i we are aware that something of the kind is to be found in london but unless we are greatly mistaken the presiding clergyman derives his ecclesiastical style from a former colonial appointment and we believe he is now at liberty to indulge his errtic tastes as a freelancethese not being altogether ape proved by oldfashioned authorities st martins

little while and then she is shunted while a batch of advanced young ladiesattired in the artcolours and doing the crewelwork which the author loathes at least twenty years before either had come into beingare reclaimed and reformed by husbands they disappear completely on this happy consummation and the heroine is again resumed to be again shunted into a very long siding indeed while a totally new

mamma may i go to jesus christ said little anna to her mother whose hand she held and who in reply could only bury her face in the bedclothes to check her sobs nelson went on gently whispering to the child of the love of christ for his children his tender lambs and she with a quiet smile leaned back on jessies shoulder and fell asleep was it sleep or death  they could not tell nelson helped to support her and thus between jessie and him annas child went away from this world and was born by angels to him who 44 gathereth the lambs in his arms the minor characters are well drawn and deserving of attention pynsent burton the doctor brother louisa colville and two uncles are well distinguished the artist brother and tiny his artist wife are well described and naturally invested with some dramatic attributes there is however a total absence of counterinterest we deplore the absence of a villain mr michelson father of chatham is only cold and disagreeable and even he repents while mrs hicks a depredating housekeeper only becomes villainous towards the end of the story does very little beyond cheating her master and burning some letters during his illness her evil disposition causes but a temporary inconvenience and evidently did not enter into miss beales original scheme mrs hicks being at first represented as rather pleasant than otherwise the greatest fault of this novel as a work of art is the disregard of dramatic balance the story proceeds through three volumes equal in length to at least a dozen by alexandre dumas and there is no reason why it should not pro ceed for many years longer with sequels and continuations equal to those of that mighty weaver of interesting tales the story is too even and equal lt lias no rise and no fall and we should not feel surprised at the successive appearance of separate works such as 44 jessie a continuation of 44 simplicity and fascination 44annabella sequel to 44jessie chatham michelson being the second series 44 tiny and in fact a hundred other works gliding one after the other with the creamy smoothness of the one before us miss beales description of wales and her knowledge of somersetshire localities answer well to the general tenor of her work  and her apparently personal objections to our course of policy in india will meet with the hearty concurrence of many of our readers it is hardly necessary for us to tell our readers that mr brooks is a very clever man and au accomplished writer all who keep themselves au courant of the passing literature of the day know his pleasant epigrammatic style and recognise his versatile fluency in travels vaudevilles and weekly newspapers accordingly when it was known that this untiring author had a three volume novel in the press great expectations were raised among the lovers of good books for his name was full of promise we hardly like to say that the promise has not been quite fulfilled  for is not the book full of clever sayings  are not its pages pitillantes of wit  whereas ninetenths of the novels of the day are equally dull and flippant mr brooks then has written a book far superior to the general run of circulating library novels undoubtedly he has but a man of his talents is hardly likely to be satisfied with such an achievement as this we presume at least that he has the laudable ambition to fill a more prominent place in the walhalla of literature and to see his works classed with those of the few great writers of prose fiction whose tales we are almost loth to call novelsa good name in itself but dishonoured by its application to every sickly story without plot invention or character which corrupts the taste if not the morals of precocious schoolboys and lovesick milliners such a position mr brooks has hardly won for the book before us clever as it undoubtedly is with much excellent writing with considerable knowledge of the world and without ono particle of dulness still as an artistical work it has many grave blemishes and offences against taste these will prevent its taking the place in literature which a novel by mr brooks ought to take the story is very complicated a debauched spendthrift mr wilmslow with a channing wife and three pretty daughters is placed in possession of a fine estate in gloucestershire aspen court through the intervention of an attorney mr molesworth whose confidential clerk mr bernard carlyonthe hero of the bookis sent down to aspen court to superintend the installation of the family and to exercise a salutary control over mr wilmslowas ferocious a domestic tyrant and consequently as arrant a coward as ever beat his wife in seven dials mr carlyon in one of his walks in the neighbourhood rescues a young lady from some rustic robbers the young lady is lilian trevelyan the representative of the family ejected by mr molesworth to make room for the wilmslows of course mr carlyon falls in love with her  of course she reciprocates  and of course in the third volume they marry but there are plenty of difficulties to overcome in the second volume and one or two wily enemies to outgeneral or defeat the most formidable are the earl of rookbury and the reverend cyprian heywood a roman catholic priest lord rookbury is a clever unprincipled old roue very charming and very gentlemanlike very avaricious and an unblushing liar mr heywood is a catholic without faith and a jesuit who laughs at his vows he is a sort of mortal mephistopheles with a power of prescience omniscience and ubiquity more vraisemblable in a german romance or in a french melo drama than in a story purporting to describe english life and character in the reign of queen victoria the peer who for his own ends wishes to do good service to carlyon persuades mr selwyn a cabinet minister and one of the bestdrawn characters in the book to take the young man as his private secretary then come plot intrigue chicanery of ali kinds lord rookbury plots against mr heywood mr molesworth against both and all three mystify bemard who has a difficult game to play among them all the fault which we have to find with the story is that it is too intricate and perplexing and but this is the case very often in actual life that there seems no adequate cause no perceptible motive for some of the subtlest machinations of the jesuit or the most daring falsehoods of the nobleman the frequent episodical chapters and thc introduction of an undue quantity of supernumeraries to speak theatrically who have nothing whatever to do with the 44business of the book are also we consider drawbacks to the merit of 44 aspen court paul chequerbent is but a ghostly revival of mr dickenss dick swheller mr molesworths clerk is far less amusing than miss sally brasss assistant and though meant to be more gentle manly and made to associate with men of fashion he is after all but a poor snob the chapters describing his policecourt adventures and gravesend junketings with angela livingstone a transpontine actress are in the worst possible taste we are sure that if mr brooks had allowed himself time to 4weed and to revise his book he would never have sent to press such vulgar trash the supperscene at mrs foresters is still more unfit for the pages of an english novel mrs forester a warmlydescribed widow is in love with selwyn the secretary of state after the opera one saturday night she invites carlyon whom she has only once before seen to supper promising him a pleasant party no one is there however but the widow and a young protegee miss maynard  a strange young lady who in the third volume carries otf heywood the infidel priest to america whore they turn mormons ho played his part well whipped the trifle called talk with an adroit hand and finding that the slightest dash of foreign flavour was not unwelcome to the taste of mrs forester he availed himself of certain parisian recollections which if indiscreetho managed discreetly enough and which were quietly appreciated by lucy forester and it must be said still more evidently relished by mary maynard and the littlo supper being perfectly served and mrs foresters wine being so exquisite that carlyon wondered who could attend to it for her the party became exceedingly radiant as the sabbath came in mrs forester lay back in her delightful chair and resting her classic head upon a soft little cushion listened with the most charming smile and retorted without taking the trouble to move her eyes from the lamp while that strange mary maynard under some pretence or other had curled herself up in a corner of the couch on which bernard was and sat in a sort of oriental attitude which had many advantages not the least being that it enabled carlyon to observe that her foot was exceedingly pretty      44 take care of him mary said she in a curious tone as she left the room as the door closed bernard turned to his attractive companion and found she was gazing wistfully at him with something like preparations for a cry what hard creatures men are his thoughts immediately recurred to the wineglass  i know you think me very strange said she after a pause which he had hardly known how to break and the symptoms of an outbreak became more and more evident but she struggled with her impulse for a moment dont make a commonplace civil answer she said4 or i shall have no patience with you i know your thoughts you are sitting there despising me as hard as you can dont tell me   a phrase which the young lady seemed to affect  presently you will go away and as you light your cigar in the street you will smile and sny4 queer girl thatsomething wrong and tomorrow you will sit down and write to miss and tell your dearest love that you went out to supper and met the oddest sort of girl with her dress off her shoulders and black hair not altogether ugly but cracked you believe  and then you will make a sketch of me for misss amusement and assure her that she has no cause for jealousy i knowdonttellme  and she almost gasped bernard compassionately took her hand a very soft and warm one and she looked up quite piteously 44 say you will not write that in your letter said mary in the most earnest and petitioning way 44 certainly if you wish it said bernard not exactly knowing what else to say 44 o t do i do so much she replied sobbing 44 will you promise it will you pledge yourself to it there i am sure you will andand it was so evident that she meant to be kissed hy way of confirmation of the promise that there was really no appeal and though of course bernard under existing circumstances most reluctantly approached her lips he did touch them and whether she hod bent too forward in her kneeling position or however else it might happen a cloud of black curls fell upon his cheek and mary maynard into his arms he could hardly look up for a moment or so but as her curls fell back from his face he did and met another gaze which is the white hermitage young carlyon said mr heywood 4 ah this i think he added quietly filling his glass there is something in all this which reminds us painfully of eugenes sues pictures of high life in paris it is strangely unpleasing to our english taste this mrs forester thus acting a part unfit to name an unprincipled gambler the harbourer and cruel taskmistress of poor mary maynard an unscrupulous tool of the jesuit heywood afterwards employed by him in a still more disreputable work marries and without any reformation on her part the highminded pious selwyn and is chosen by bernard carlyon to present at court his pureminded wife  surely mr brooks must see the gross indelicacy of all this the man who draws such bewitching characters of women as jane wilmslow little amy and the lofty lilian cannot be utterly insensible to all the finer feelings the chapter describing the incarceration of the wilmslows girls by lord rookbury in his house at rookton woods is certainly as exciting as a chapter in monte christo but even more improbable the second title of this book is 44 a story of our own time we cannot quite believe in the existence nowadays in england of such wonderful mechanical contrivances to prevent escape to facilitate eavesdropping and to convert the drawingrooms of a countryhouse into a sensuous oriental harem as are described as part of the household furniture of the earl of rookbury such startling improbabilities not to say anachronisms greatly mar the effectiveness of the book as a description of modern manners it is more pleasing to read such a scene as this full of truth and tenderness where the two hard men of the world exchange a few words of honest sympathy and sorrow for the poor mother about to lose her darling child  441 hope nothing is seriously the matter with poor little amy 441 fear said lord rookbuiy4 that the poor child is not long for this world what amy exclaimed bernard much shocked 44that sunshiny little face he stopped to hear more 44 a cloud has como over that sunshine said the karl in a tone of real feeling  and i doubt whether a darker shadow be not approaching faster than is believed at aspen court i have seen some sad business in my time carlyon he continued 44 and there is not much that i need a physician should tell me but a physioian will have to tell a cruel story to poor dear mrs wilmslow before long 44 it will kill her said carlyon in a low voice 44 she is the best mother in the world and is devoted to all the girls but little amy she idolizes 44 and i will tell you why said lord kook bury once more speaking in the calm voice of ono who analyses a subject but without sympathy 4l that child was born just os the dream that henry wilmslow was anything but a selfish profligate came to an end amy is the link between her mothers happiness and her desolation that link is about to be broken but mrs wilmslow has too strong a sense of duty to let her heart break with sorrow carlyon listened with much surprise as lord rookbury uttered these sentences bernard had never heard him give so much proof that he coidd appreciate a womans nature or her goodness that evil old man who had walked in his reckless way over the worlds best gardens he had then sometimes owned the beauty of the flowers he had snatched and cast away more often perhaps than the younger man imagined carlyon accordingly takes down a great london doctor who having seen amy pronounces her to be dying rapidly the cowardly cur her father listening behind a curtain hears the sad statement without sorrow but with rage at his not being taken into their confidence and determined that the awful news shall not be broken gently to his poor wife rushes into the garden whither the gentlemen had gone to seek her and tells the terrible truth in his own vicious way amy had sat down upon a gardenseat then kate to bernards surprise laid her hand on his arm and made a gesture that she must speak to him apart they proceeded a few steps from the rest of the party 41 there is no time for more than one word is that a doctor and is amy dying 44 yes said bernard her hand clutched upon his arm and he felt her tremble violently but she mastered her agitation and said in a hasty and imploring voice  tell mamma you tell her for gods sakenow bernard guessed all sprang to mrs wilmslows side and made an imperative sign to rockbrook unperceived by her that he must instantly make his communication the readywitted physician understood him and without comprehending the emergency of the case offered his arm to his hostess with a request that she would permit him to say a word or two jane gentle as ever took his arm though with some surprise but they had scarcely turned from the others when a strong hand was laid upon her shoulder aud her husband stood among them he was excited by liquor but in the perfect possession of his faculties and hi face bloated by low debauchery bore a savage expression which as it seemed to carlyon at the moment would have justified him iu felliug wilmslow to the ground 44 ah  im in time i see he said as jane in her habitual effort to screen her husbands vices forced a smile and tried to frame some playful words to help him to excuse his rudeness the smile told him that she had not heard the fatal news 44 one word with you mr wilmslow said carlyon dashing in as a last chance for he saw henrys intention u i havo a message to you from lord liookbury just como and hear ita secret from the ladies 44 indeed returned wilmslow looking at him with on insolent scowl 441 ll hear it at my leisure mr soqretury carlyon sir what 1 have to say is what this gentleman says that a mother ought to hear from her husband i believe those were your words sir i was afraid that my daughter might have forestalled me 44 take her away said bernard to rockbrook 44 at your peril sir shouted wilmslow seizing his wife by the arm  i have only to inform you mrs wilmslow he said in a drawling malicious voice 44 that this gentleman is a london doctor brought down by th at gentleman to seo your youngest daughter and his report is that she is dying and cant live two months all eyes turned to seek amy who retained her seat at the foot of the old tree but the mother was the first to clasp her in her arms 441 knew it said amy quietly 441 thought you all knew it oh yes i am dying i from that day wilmslow is a doomed man molesworth and carlyon who never forgive pursue the wretch to his merited destruction the reason given for molesworth having brought about the wretched marriage between the brute wilmslow and the gentle jane tracy again reminds us of eugene sue that a man disappointed in winning for himself a woman whom he loves with the strong passions of his energetic nature should plot to consign her to the arms of a sot a villain aud a fool in order that she might never respect her husband or love him is too melodramatic a piece of absurdity for our sober english taste there is an excellent description of a debate in the house of commons from which we extract the following spirited sketch  he was hardly down whon one of the staunchest buders of the opposition stood at the red box on the other bide he confronted the ministers boldly as became the fearless and honest commoner lord of half a county and with a pedigree few lords can show lacking the practised composure of the minister he grew excited even with the game in his own hands and the broad hale face reddened up to the roots of the silver hair a fine kindly old man that county member and one who would far gladlier have led the whole house after one of his foxes than have hounded them on to tear down u minister but he thought ho saw duty and it had boen a wuy with the men of his blood for eight hundred years to do it the house rang again with his lusty old voice as he denounced the bad measure and the worse cabinet and moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months the speakers eye fell right and left with extreme impartiality now calling up an energetic barrister bent on a solicitorgeneralship and now a wealthy shipowner strong in wellapplied sense stronger in illapplied aspirates a professional orator delivered his prepared harangueit did not lit very well being un answer to what had not been said but was otherwise unexceptionable  and another gentleman primed with champagne let off a  smart speech which he had got ready for a previous night but had not been able to make  hie jokes missed fire certainly but so they would have done at any other time ireland pronounced against the minister and again enlivened the scene by another littlo internicene war in which munster scoffed mightily at and was scoffed at mightily by connaught the night wore and though great guns roared not timid cries of  divide  broke out as two or three bores successively rose watching his opportunity and springing up after the very stupidest of these in order that ho might snatch and mangle him by way of an opening compliment to the house which tolerates bores wonderfully but rejoices to see them tortured the great leader of opposition stood in the battle a perfect and accomplished debater calmest when apparently stormiest with a studied tone for every taunt and a practised gesture for every jibe his shaft missed no mark his arm struck no blow short he appealed to ancient principles to historic names to the honourable traditions of party to the proud clements of the constitution and he urged in accents alternately sonorous and bitter that for an old principle the advisers of though crown had substituted a manchestermade expediency that they read history backwards as witches read prayers and with though same desirethat of raising a destructive fiend that they had abandoned party traditions for disgraceful hucksterings and that if they had hitherto abstained from destroying thc constitution it was chiefly because they had hoped to make a better bargain by selling it with these and few other gentle imputations delivered in the most masterly and artistic style of which oratory is capable and with a glowing eulogium upon the party with which the speaker was advancing to save the country he concluded one of those dashing and deadly philippics which are a feature in parliamentary history lilian is a charming heroine but bernard carlyon though least loveable of heroes we were at first puzzled to account for our repulsion to this young man he is brave generous and openhanded courteous to womenthe qualities these of a true hero some of the qualities granted but not all there is no sympathy in his character no tenderness no enthusiasm he is cold worldly and calculating we are never led to suppose that he cares for politics or party of a sudden we find him the active energetic assistant of a secretary of state to whom he has been consigned and wc cannot help thinking that he is a mere political swiss who would serve a secretary of state of the opposite party just as strenuously if his doing so would advance his prospects sceptical in all things trusting in nothing but his own hard sense and unflinching boldness his very love for lilian trevelyan savours less of tender passion than of a tierce resolve to win what such clover schemers as lord rookbury mr molesworth afterwards and for no earthly purpose discovered to be his father and mr heywood his priestlyrival are equally determined to withhold from him such a man may be very clever very successful  but he will never bo much beloved even in real life and is by no means a good hero for a novel we like a man of tnier principle higher purpose and more generous impulses to be the winner of womans love and the sharer of our own sympathies we take leave of 4 aspen court with mingled regret and hope regret that mr brooks should have written no better a book with hope that his next work will be more genial in its tone less improbable in its plot and more refined in its descriptions of life and manners a book sad and beautiful and true as life itself wonderful and mysterious is the power which we denominate genius an artist with a soul for beauty and an eye for colour with welltrained taste and scholarly mind studies at rome drinks in inspiration at the hague and at dresden wanders entranced through the louvre and comes back to beniers street with matured judgment honest enthusiasm and mighty ambition only to throw away his pencil in despair and to kick down his easel with disappointment he loves his art intensely ho worships it passionately he understands it thoroughly but beyond this is a barrier which it has not been given him to overpass scholarship poetry taste study are there but the power which wo call genius has been withheld anon a young girl who has studied little in comparison and who has had none of his opportunities in a week or two with a few touches produces a picture before which he kneels with though honest homage of an unselfish worshipper and in whose work he recognises the magic power which he may never attain save in a dream why is this why when two artists draw portraits of living men and women and children is the one only a lawrence while the other is a reynolds  both paint likenesses as leonardo da vinci and benjam  simplicity and fascination or guardians and wards by anne beale 3 vols bentley the only foolish thing in this novel is its title which is certainly enough to deter any but an adventurous reader from its pages  those who begin will however find their virtue rewarded by as pleasant a novel as they would wish to read on a winters day it is a welldrawn picture of english domestic life the characters are well contrasted and the situations and incidents are interesting aunt betsy and uncle timothy are our favourites jessie the mothersister to her family is charmingwhich is saying no little for a model heroine the book ends happily which is always pleasant and a misanthrope must have hopes of a world where so many happy marriages can take root and flourish there areas many couples as in an english countrydance and although the figure is a little complicated yet the right partners find each other at last and everybody marries precisely the right person if the candid reader had been consulted ever so much he could not have arranged matters more to the contentment of everybody

  pawnee hero stories and folk  tales with notes on the origin customs and character of the pawnee people by g b grinnell to which is added a chapter on the pawnee language by john b dunbar nutt  blackfoot lodge tales the story of a prairie people by g b grinnell same publisher tne pawnee tribe ocaupied the banks of the platte river in nebraska where now stands the flourishing city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has several woodcut illustrations,northamerica
  young lives by richard le gallienne arrowsmith fis 7ms is mr le galliennes third novel and taken with these that preceded itthe quest of the golden girl and the romance of zion chapelit shows us clearly what ara his powers and limitations in fiction it shows us that tos the qelineation of a certain type of young man a product of the best two decades mr le gallienne has considerable gifts he young man is of the nonconformist middle dasses his home ls strict arid pious his own bent however is for poetry and gladness he is frank impulsive enthusiastic generous warmhearted intolerant of alltiiat is dull and mechanical and very tolerant of whatever is  done beautifully however it may conflict with the moral code he is an agnostic with leanings towards elaborate ritual a busy but superficial reader his gods being keats and pater a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of rossetti ana burnejones a sentimentalist he oan adore many young women at once and in rhyming  love  and  dova  and  bosom  and  blossom  he is expert if he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable but far less  lovable  and to be  lovable is his end in life that is the type of young man to whioh we refer a type whioh at this moment is common in london and in all the great towns all over the oountry and it is this young man whom mr le gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill and as we said last week in noticing another new novel every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction mr le gallienne is not a good novelist he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful he ia always the essayist astorytolling glad of an opportunity to digress but though he has little to toll in the book before us and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed the tone is bright and sunny and the characters are pretty and gay but the readers will have to be simple we fear because with the exception of the type who rings true there is a great deal of chocolatebox unreality about the story baptist ministers for example onwhose shelves is all the most exquisite literature of doubt are not really named chrysostom trotter it is largely these wilful little perversions of fact which mr le gallienne always indulges in that keep sophisticated readers from his works but for their especial benefit we take it the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher mr le gallienne here hits round him with spirit sparing not even himself we quote a passage presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hairlike a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood at the same moment there entered as if by design his very eatithesis a short firmlybuilt clerkly fellow with a head hkea billiardball in need of a shave a big brown  moustitohs aad enormous spectacles   that said the publisher referring to the

would hasten it if he would cut his hair but tbat he says he will never do his hair is his battlecry aad hair too he says is a gift well he enjoys himself and loves a fight though you mightnt think it to look at him in laying young lives aside we cannot honestly say it has interested us but it is innocent and bright and young and it is written with care  young lives bv richard le gallienne bristol arrowsmith a duet with an occasional chorus by a conan doyle grant richards here is another volume of secondrate sentiment from mr richard le gallienne we cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or notat any rate it reads as if it were meant to be it describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a northern town whose home surroundings as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes were uncongenial the young manto the benefit probably of the home to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his fatherdetermined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature he gets some poems published he falls in love and he keeps up his affection for his sister but it all reads false somehow the young man is most devoted to his sister which is very right and proper and charming no doubt but he is not content with that and must needs analyse his feelings and her feelings and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of it is the same with his sweetheart angel they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments they see a rossetti picture which they admire and they call it their church and their altar they are probably not conscious hypocrites but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites who having a fine feeling think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world the sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity this book is full of that kind of sentimentality and it is bad mr conan doyles tale on the other hand certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality it is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people who make love and get married their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet but they are fine in character and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward the book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middleclass respectability which is unassuming and not discontented of the two sets of characters mr doyles characters would certainly have less to talk about than henry and angel but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting for they are genuine and they are described simply and without affectation if mr le gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable but without a suspicion of satire they are duller than the limited yet excellent crosses,northamerica
  the riverman by stewart e white tiodder  staughton about this long carefully written story with its vivid descriptions of log drivings on an american river there is a delightful scent of the open air jack orde the strong resolute simplehearted lumberman whose will and resourcefulness are always being opposed and developed by storms and floods and  jams is a striking and pleasing figure his swift courtship of a new york girl and the homely scenes of his married life have an idyllic touch but the story when it carries orde away from its effective views of forest and stream is commonplace and unreal,northamerica
  the sacred fount new novels by henry james methuen  co mk james narrates this story in the first person so that the experiences and reflections of the narrator appear as if they were mr jamess own in order to keep up the dramatic illusion we shall preserve mr jamess own name in describing the narrator though it must not be imagined that we regard his use of the first person singular as anything but a dramatic fiction  mr james then one summer day found himself at a london terminus on the way to a country house party which we are to believe was one of the smartest for example not only do the husbands pair off as a matter of course with other peoples wives but they do not even take the same trains as their lawful partners moreover the food and the pictures and other luxuries of a decadent civilization are all to be found of the very best at this smartly unconventional establishment poor  mr james the dramatic character evidently not being wholly at home in such a smart set is naturally somewhat impressed and rather shy at the prospect before him but he very sensibly determines to make the most of a unique occasion by going about with a mental not ebook and an inquiring disposition  and he does not lose an instant j in beginning for at the station he sees a mr long whom he had once or twice before met at the same house but who had always hitherto consistently cut him at other places this gentleman he had consequently put down as a fool but on this occasion long recognises him with some warmth and the change is so remarkable and surprising to  mr james that he immediately assumes that long has become quite intelligent and devotes his inquiring mind through the rest of the book to trying to find out how such a change has come about he has not arrived at the end of his train journey before he has elaborated a theory in collaboration with a mrs brissenden who of course is travelling down without her husband and who in the wellknown way of smart poople habitually calls this husband  poor briss the theory shadowy as it is seems to be the chief point of these pages so we shall leave anybody who is sufficiently interested to find it out for himself to find confirmation for it 44mr james has a merry time of it with all the other characters of the book he goes about button  holing all the men generally opening with my dear man to show his intimate knowledge of polite society and even the ladies of the party have an occasional my dear woman tossed to them he does not impart to any of them his theoryhe is far too subtle for thatbut he tries to lead them by the most terribly long  winded conversations into admissions of a position of which they are supremely unconscious to do them justice most of his interlocutors are supremely bored by liim and have very little scruple in telling him so  you cant be a providence and not be a bore says one of the good women plainly enough to him but if his interlocutors are bored what must his readers be  for not content with writing out all these subtly incoherent conversations at length he sometimes interrupts them for four or five pages on end to explain the portentous signification which his imagination sees in a droop of the lips or a movement of the hand the book ends up with a conversation of about one hundred pages with mrs brissenden it takes place in the drawingroom after twelve when most of the ladies have gone to bed and the servants have been squared another subtle and characteristic touch of smart society to leave the lights on as a result of this terribly improper conference in the full blaze of the electric light it appears that not only is mr jamess  theory incorrect anyhow but that it is absolutely gratuitous as the fact which it should have explained is not a fact for long turns out to be as great an ass as ever the whole book is an example of hypochondriacal subtlety run mad the characters in the book are simple stupid english people direct and comparatively uninteresting and  mr james becomes simply a bore besides being vulgar in his absurd attempt to read into them subtle conditions of soul of which they are totally incapable  fiction the sacred fount by henry james heinemann 6s had anyone but mr james written this book his admirers might well have cried  oh tis sacrilege but since mr james himself is the author what can we say but that he has in his own brilliantly tedious way with his own inimitable art and with his own occult knowledge of what the lifting of an eyebrow or the movement of a back may meansucceeded triumphantly in an elaborate satire on himselfthat is on his own obsession  everybody knows what mr jamess obsession is and after achieving the last page of this volume it is evident to us that mr james also knows with him as with the character without a name who tells the story the vision of life is an obsession to him for real excitement  there are no such adventures as the intellectual ones  in every word or action of his fellowcreatures he perceives motives that like the lines on a railway siding have no beginning and no end mr james has never carried his analysis of the daintily unimportant further than in the sacred fount and never before to our knowledge has he after incredible labour with bricks of gossamer and mortar of sunbeams blown down the dainty edifice with such a goodhumoured series of puffs the last page brings a vision of mr henry james stepping forward and saying with a profound obeisance   you perceive how prodigiously i know myself the sacred fount we may say without more ado is youth the theme of the book is the hypothesis that youth has the power to rejuvenate and vivify age but at the cost of the oozing away of the sap of youth from itself but mr james is not a believer in his own theory or only to a certain extent he turns tail he allows his speculations to be derided and the end is more smoke than fire or perhaps it would be fairer to say that he uses his hypothesis merely as a means of showing to what prodigious lengths the analytical mind can go it is as if the princess in the fairy tale from the suggestion of the presence of the pea beneath her mattress had created a market garden of flowering shrubs the pea represents the cell from which mr james as master nurseryman has produced his garden of exotics a day and an evening cover the period of the story which passes at newmarch a country house of liberal ease and delightful appurtenances there a few choice guests are gathered among them is the narrator with his passion for embroidering on things and his genius for seeing a hundred complex reasons behind a cursory remark or a chance movement the way you get hold of things says mrs brissenden sometimes she is called mrs briss  is positively uncanny it is here is an example of just how much the nameless narrator we must restrain ourselves from the temptation of identifying him with mr james sees in a glance something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to hi in at the house he had met his wife she had in 8 me way dealt with him he had beeu with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him we have not space to quote the many things this rontgenrayeyed guest saw in mrs brissendens back but we can assure the reader that a page of the book does not cover them his awakening is due to mrs brissenden she patiently refuses to play the part of a pretty fly refuses to walk into the parlour to put a pretty copingstone to his palace of gossamer instead she fires her bright artillery at him and the concussion shakes down the palace of gossamer he has been elaborating his theories at infinite length and her comments are   how can i tell please what you consider youre talking about    you see too much    you talk too much    you overestimate the penetration of others     youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build upyou build up houses of cards are we extravagant in suggesting that this is mr henry james in a grimly humorous mood turning his analytical mind on himself the skill of the story is enormous  the triumph of its artistic presentment is indisputable only mr james could have written it so much we grant willingly but since an authors power of being able to interest his reader in his story as story must depend on the temperament and predilection of the reader we will give our personal verdict by slightly modifying one of mr jamess own locutions the narrator in the pause that follows some remarks he has made to mrs brissenden thus soliloquises oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it we would saythe transposition is slight oh how intensely we didnt like having to read our way to the very end of the sacred fount if mr james hadnt so handsomely put into it all his delicate talent and thus illumined the tediousness of the story we should not only have made a wry face but yawned ourselves away to the company ofwell of john silver or captain kettle,northamerica
  a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them dr holmes unlike some othersmay still be trusted with a pen did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it i waltek lewin,northamerica

  tales of the coloules by john iiou ion athor of sketche of upper canada 2 vols 12mv thcse tales are more unequal in point of interest than is usual in tales lpro ceeding front the same source of invention though only two of them strictly answer to the general title the first is the story of a halfpay lieutenant of the navy condemned to vegetate on some lone spot on the irish coast and dying of ennui wearying of existence and panting for excitement in this state of feeling approaching to one of despair luckily a stranger of most mysterious bearing lands on the coast who by degrees makes his acquaintance and finally gives himi his confidence 1le proves to be the last of a crew of buccanelrs who had long plundered the mexican shores and in a soli tary isle off the coast along with other spoil equally precious had buried a mass of churchplate this valuable booty the old man proposes to the lieutenant to go in pursuit ofhe himself renouncing all claim and professing only now to be preparing for the grave the lieutenant of course accedes as much for the sake of the adventure as of the plunder and receiving the necessary information starts forthwith his adventures in securing the prize constitute the staple of the tale which is full of improbabilities and presents little inducement to the reader to try the next the next however is considerably betterthe incidents are more stirring and striking leaving the impression of actual reality though of a very singular cast the scene is placed in the heart of antigua remote from other plantations where the worst passions might be indulged unchecked by the awe of a neighbourbood but the third tale takes by far the strongest hold of the feelings a young man of good family who having wasted a very considerable pros perty of his own and much of his mothers is in a moment of perplexity precipitated into an act of forgery to relieve the parent he has so deeply injured isle is sentenced to botany bay whither he is conveyed mixed up with the lowest of the human race the scene opens at sydney ihe is quickly assigned as a labourer on a farm in the interior where he finds some relief in being separated from his odious companions hle resolves to make the best of his condition and conciliate the good will of his master by diligence and usefulness unluckily he has a most untractable animal to deal with the colonist was one of the middle class of english farmers honest but rough and uncultivatedjust enough but coarse and prejudiced lie made no distinctions a convict was a felon and he knew nothing of the early history of his slave and cared nothing his family consisted of a sister and a niece both of them comparatively civilized the young lady especially seemned in that lonely spot one of the loveliest of human beings by degrees the youth contrives to snake some of the acconm plishments of his superior condition known to the ladies and is beginning to excite at least something like sympathy when the jealousy and vengeance of afeinale convict whose overtures to closer acquaintance he had rejected infuses some suspicion into the farmer and he in the rage of the moment loads him with abuse and accompanies it with a blow this is not to be borne the young man flies from the house and takes refuge among the bushinen with whom a few weeks before he had had an accidental encounter in a few days the gang propose to levy contributions on the farmer the youth for the sake of the ladies warns the farmer of the approaching attack a kindness which lie repays by betraying him to his associates from the indignation of these desperadoes he narrowly escapes by darting into the woods and elulding pursuit in his forlorn condition he joins a small party of the natives and again from somte misunderstanding with them he with difficulty escapes being speared afterroaming for some time in the woods exposed to a variety of perils he is suddenly arrested by a party of soldiers in search of an outlaw and by them conducted to sydney where he finds his mother who had procured his enancipation with her he continues for soeic time at sydney and is by the liberal party admitted into society here he encounters agrain his old masters niece whose affections he speedily wins and is finally prevailed upon to visit the uncle and endeavour to propitiate him the attempt is attended with fatal consequences he proved inflexible and was that very night inurdered by a bushmana fact which threw suspicion upon his visiter though not convicted of the crime in the course of the trial his flight from his master and intercourse with the bushmen became known and he was in consequence doomed to the public works at paraimatta reduced to a more deplorable condition than ever he joined a party in an attempt to seize a sloop and escape they were pursued and in the conflict the miserable youth was shot the tatle is entitled the false step and the p urpose of the writer is to trace its irretrievable consequences the moral is good in principle but it must of course fail in exact proportion to the excessive rigour with which it is pursued  11111 i i 01cdf lo it 4  w th a i r it fit

revised form his algie researches which have been out of print for some years the peculiar opportunities which the author has enjoyed during a lengthened residence among the ojibways on an exploring expedition have not been lost he has collected a large number of the wild tales of the indians and he relates them with a simplicity which creates confidence in the accuracy of the translations made by the author and various friends named in the preface to the algie researches but not mentioned in the present work that there is a want of variety in the legends is not the fault of the author and that history and fiction are blended in them is assuredly not a circumstance peculiar to indian myths nor does it detract from their value their true interest beyond the quaint poetry which is occasionally to be traced in them is the insight which they give of indian character in them the man appears no pompous enunciator of commonplace truthsno cold abstraction of courage and enduranceas he has been represented by some novelists we see him with all his sagacity in small thingshis lack of extended vision and of the art and power of combinationhis suspicions ignorance and superstitions even hiawatha or manabozho in prose is a very different person from that hero in the poem those who have formed his acquaintance when decked in his poetical garb will be shocked to find that he is a notorious liar even among his compatriotsthat he invites his friends the birds and beasts to supper and firings their necks as they march by him at his request with their eyes shut  that he murders his hospitable friend the beaver in cold bloodand in short is hardly more respectable than his mythological brethren of greece old nohomis also in prose is said to have had a paramour in the shape of a beara strange form by the by for a lover however it might have fitly represented a married partner but while we recognise the value of these traditions as illustrations of the character of the indian they by no means possess the charm of the poetical versions during the perusal of some of them we felt to adopt the indian creed that the little servants of the great weeng the spirit of sleep were hammering at our temples in a manner that prevented our keeping our eyes open the indians admit however that these little spirits have no judgment which accounts for the sleep which occasionally overcomes them when floating above a fall or in other positions of danger and which may explain certain phenomena sometimes observed in our own churches while some are dull however others have a certain poetry of conception and strangeness of events that may amuse even after the rela j tion of the same or kindred tales by prof j longfellow but the most generally interesting portion of the book is that denominated  wild notes ofthe pibbigwun which contains some songs and small poems in the simple ideas of which though the metre and treatment are different much of the charm of the poem of hiawatha may be traced a very pretty allegory of niagara we extract an old grey man on a mountain lived he had daughters four and one and a tall bright lodge of the betula bark that glittered in the sun he lived on the very highest top for he was a hunter free where he could spy on the clearest day gleams of the distant sea 41 come out come out cried the youngest one  let us off to look at

we are gone so far that if we flinch and return in fear nos he will cry ila  ha  now each was clad in a vesture light that floated far behind with sandals of frozen water drops and wings of painted wind ami down they plunged with a merry skip like birds that skim the plain  and  hey  they cried  let us up and try  and down the steep again  and up and down the daughters shipped like girls on u

but marktheir shapes are only seen in fancys deepest play  but she plainly shows their wings and feet in the dancing sunny spray there is a selection of such verses at the end of dr schoolcrafts

  e  mollies prince by rosa nouchette carey hutchinson  co mollies prince is of the nature of a survival and on this and other grounds not to be entirely ignored stories of the kind have it seems a measure of popularity the general intention and the treatment of human nature in this one are certainly of the kindliest and the outlook on life persistently amiable but from the intellectual artistic or worldlyknowledge standpoint it cannot for obvious reasons be praised in construction and character it consists of what was twentyyears ago considered good enough for girl readers four couples at least are made happy ever after and everything necessary to existence and a good deal more is showered on those who know how to wait the ward family is discovered in the first chapter at a very low ebb financially speaking in a house facing the chelsea hospital an  umble ome no doubt but not till now associated with dire poverty and bootless misery yet it is just boots or their absence that frequently blocks the conversational path at no 10 cleveland terrace soon however the acute reader detects the rustle of angel wings and guardian spirits hovering in the distance the first to materialise is a viscount with twenty thousand a year his wayward ideal is to be loved for himself and tothis end he woos the lovely mollie in the disguise of a virtuous bohemianwhatever that may be unrestrained by mr ward the father of the family and  a proud man the younger man loads the larder with delicacies  game fruit wine and so forth flowers nicknacks consulting physicians concert tickets sofas trained nurses and other articles of use or adornment follow mr wards protests against these lavish proceedings are so faint and perfunctory and his eventual yielding so certain that the author is the only person who takes his apparent reluctance at ali seriously what the reader is likely to take rather seriously is the family joke it is frequent depressing and of the english hearthrug pattern not to share a little in miss careys joy in the presents that are the leitmotifoi the story would be churlish when some oneprobably the disguised nobleman insists on providing the wards with a fixed income and two trousseaux mollie has a sister and cleaning decorating and refurnishing the chelsea house the impecunious reader suffers an envious pang the cup runs over when maiden ladies also play fairy godmother to this simple but not unreceptive family two sapphirecoloured velveteen gowns for the girls evening wear are presented the only blot on the opulence of the picture is that they are not of velvet i the joyful climax for the reader and every one else comes when mr ward with that native touch of ephemeral hesitation accepts the hand of the rich and benevolent spinster he has jilted in early youth we leave everybody in a perfect maze of cheerful discoveries as to hidden relationships and longlost friends exactly like the people in novels of the early victorian period,northamerica

  before the dawn by katherine james chapman and hall 6s the young authorand the mature one too for that matterwould do well to pay good heed to punctuation in the telling of a story and in this book the point is well emphasised paragraph after paragraph of otherwise good english is spoilt by the introduction of commas where full stops were needed the intrusions of semicolons into places where commas would have sufficed and similar jerks on the breath of the reader we may overlook an occasional split infinitive or faulty phrase for the sake of good subjectmatter but here is english as she should not be handled and we resent it the period is 1849 the place italy the hero is one leone who in the end gives his life for the cousin whom he loved in its personal scenes the story has airather melodramatic effect even for southern europe the characters are a little too stagey to be real and the mistakes arising out of the marvellous resemblance between philip sinclair and his brothermistakes which we know full well will be remedied in the last chapterdo not ring true on its historical side the novel provides good reading not so heavy as to weary the reader yet sufficiently detailed to attest its authors grip of a period difficult to follow in its intricate happenings we would recommend miss james to get a little manual on punctuation and also to beware of too much limelight in her next worklifelight gives better results at the same time while admitting its imperfections we welcome the present volume as pleasant holiday reading,northamerica
  with rank and file by arthur amyand osgo3d and mcllvaine these  sidelights on soldier life are kindly efforts to raise our appreciation of our soldiers by tales of their hardships their humours and their heroisms mr kipling has done it with genius once and for all it may be said but his success need not close the door on others with equally good intentions if less skill mr amyands stories are not very clever but they are generous and sympathetic and written with a close knowledge of military life the melancholy tale of slip and dandy and that of the unlucky clumps are touching in a simple wholesome way we must say however that the pathetic note is a trifle too much insisted on a little more high spirits in these rank and file stories would not have lessened our sympathy with the good fellows of which they tell,northamerica
  the harvest moon by j s fletcher eveleigh nash our author again lays the scene of his tale in yorkshire but there is no such delightful delineation as in his  mr poskitt though the heroine who widens and deepens her sympathies through tribulation is finely drawn the tale shows life in one of its most unsatisfactory aspects the heroine in dawning womanhood with all the latent powers of her being stirring within her is deliberately left by her father who believes in her purity but ignores her womanhood in a farmhouse with no other companion than a handsome young painter of undoubted talent and great ambition immediately after the painter is called away and apparently henceforward forgets her existence until their next meeting at the deathbed of their son meanwhile the woman has consoled herself with her child the story is told with delicacy but a false note is struck at the reunion of the parents  and we are left wondering if the future career of the reunited couple 9 would be anything but tragedy the minor characters  including a country doctor who patiently loves the heroine with slowly dying hope of reward and his housemate and helpmate sister also a pathetic figure of an old belgian schoolmasterare remarkably well done and add greatly to the other claims of the book on the attention of the public  the hawest moon fiction by j s fletcher eveleigh nash 6s those readers who know mr j s fletcher mainly as a brilliant and sympathetic interpreter of yorkshire life will hardly recognise him in his new novel in  the harvest moon  he has ventured on alien ground for the  enchanting north  plays but a subsidiary part in these pages the story however opens in yorkshire adrien darrell a young painter is touring the northern counties in quest of local colour an accident brings him to the farmstead of cornelius van de linde but it is less an accident than the inevitable workings of destiny that makes him fall in love with corneliuss pretty daughter mr fletcher is at his best in these earlier chapters he has succeeded in investing his narrative with the atmosphere of an english country house and there is an enchanting idyllic quality in those scenes which record the lovemaking of adrian and linda the idyll quickly disappears however to give place to tragedy and with the death of cornelius and the seduction of linda we enter upon a more gloomy phase of the narrative linda is left desolate expecting the birth of her child she leaves england and seeks sanctuary in bruges waiting and waiting in vain for the return of her absent lover meanwhile her life centres in her boy whom she cherishes with a fierce affection that is perhaps not far removed from selfishness the boy inherits the artistic instincts of his father and at the request of a visitor to bruges himself a famous artist he is sent to rome to complete his education linda quickly follows to find that the boy has just been killed in an accident she meets the man who has befriended him who is none other than the lover by whom she has been so cruelly betrayed there follows a flight from rome and a succession of months in which linda is learning the harctlesson of selfrenunciation and selfforgetfulness ultimately harmony is restored from so many discordant elements and the book closes on a scene of happiness and reunited affection the quality of the writing is excellent throughout and mr fletcher has been particularly happy in his delineation of the minor characters monsieur verbecke in particular a quaint but altogether lovable blend of the ecclesiastic and the pedant is a triumph of portraiture but the chief interest of the story lies with linda and it is for this masterly presentation of the development of a soul that mr fletchers book deserves the highest praise,northamerica

  the europeans the europeans  a sketch by henry james jun in two volumes macmillan by his clever essays on french poets and novelists mr henry james has made himself a reputation on this side of the atlantic as well as in his own country if  the europeans does not prove him to have as much skill in writing novels aa in writing essays it leaves the question open though spun out in the english edition into two volumes the europeans  might very well have been printed in one and it is altogether too light in its workmanship to be classed among regular novels superior as it is to most of them it is in fact a daintilywritten aud wellconstructed prose comedy containing very few incidents and some of these being rather preposterous but on the whole giving a lively  sketch as he very fitly calls it of one phase of life and one aspect of character in new england the story is of an enterprising lady the daughter of american parents but born and bred in europe morgauatically married to a jetty german prince whose family is now anxious to divorce him from her amicably and of the adventures that follow from her efforts to fall in with these proposals if she can make it convenient to do so she bears the title of baroness munster and has persuaded her brother a goodnatured bohemian whose name is plain felix young and who has no other occupation than that of a strolling artist and an amiable pleasure seeker in general to go with her from her german home on a visit to their unknown kinsfolk who live somewhere near boston there we meet them in the first chapter and in the chapters that follow we arc entertained with the small confusions and complications occasioned by the arrival of these harmless bohemians in ti new england arcadia whose inmates for some time do not know what to make of them thc head of the family ibo strangers uncle is a mr wentworth a wealthy man and in every way as good as his own gold but so oppressed with the solemnity of life and its duties as to find no room for pleasure in his scheme of existence though at the same time an excellent and indulgent father to his son clifford and his daughters charlotte and gertrude the son as drawn bv mr james is not a very interesting young man  but the daughters are charmine charlotte wentworth is thc martha of the family an ideal martha of modern times looking after cverrbody s comfort and anxious for everybodys happiness anet so unselfish that she does not know she is in love with mr brand the prim young unitarian minister whom sho is anxious to marry to her sister because she thinks the match would bc to her sisters spiritual welfaro and would be a very agreeable arrangement for mr brand himself gertrude wentworth is more visionary and something of an anomaly in this puritan family felix young comes as a revelation to her from the gay outside world about which she has been dreaming all her life and soon persuades her that ho is much more likely than mr brand to make her happy  there must be a thousand different ways of being dreary she says in one of her pretty naive flirtations with felix and sometimes i thinkwe make use of them all  i am trying for once to be natural she says at another time when mr brand is expostulating with her for her innocent levity  i have been pretending all my life why shouldnt i be frivolous if i want  one has a right to be frivolous if its ones nature no i dont care for great questions i care for pleasurefor amusement here is a bit of the last chapter in which the family is discussing whether gertrude shall be allowed to marry felix   havent you confidence in felix gertrude was frowning thero was something about her that her father and charlotte had never seen before charlotte got up and came to her as if to put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid to touch her mr wontworth however was not afraid  i have had moro confidence in felix than in you he said yes you have never had confidence in menever never i dont know why  oh sister sister murmured charlotte you have always needed advice mr wentworth declared you have had a difficult temperament 11 why do you call it difficult it might have been easy if you had allowed it you wouldnt let mo bo natural i dont know what you wanted to make of me       i havo nover seen you so passionate obsorvod mr wentworth with an air of indignation mitigated by high principles  i am sorry if i offend you said gertrude  you offend me but i dont think you are sorry  yes father she is sorry said charlotte i would even go further dear uncle felix interposed i would question whethor she really offends you how can she offend you  to this mr wontworth made no immediate answer then in a moment  she has not profited as wo hoped gertrude was very palo sho stood looking down i have told felix i would go away with him she presently said  go away sister asked charlotte awayaway to some strange country towhat do you call it turning an instant to felix  to bohemia  do you proposo to dispense with preliminaries asked mr wentworth getting up gertrude turned to hor father i tm re profited she said you wanted to form my character well my character is formedfor my age i know what i want i havo chosen i am determined to marry this gentleman what little romance there is in  the europeans  gathers round the baroness and a certain mr acton  but we will not weaken the interest of the story to its readers by detailing this especially as the real merit of the book lies chiefly in its descriptions of gertrude and felix and the matters immediately concerning them these descriptions are fresh delicate and artistic to english readers the europeans will be particularly attractive because of the graceful picture mr janies draws of a condition of society hardly possible in this country and perhaps the kindly satire with which he touches up the picture will be as intelligible to them as to the americans who know the realities of nineteenth century puritanism in its pleasantest aspects in the out of the wray suburbs of boston we may hope great things of mr james when he tries his hand at a more elaborate novel,northamerica

  boy life on the prairie american fiction by hamlin garland macmillan  coprairie folks same author and publishersthe life of a boy in northern iowa thirty years ago can only interest english readers in so far as it is told with artistic skill and in so far as it presents curiosities in the way of adventure or of manners and customs mr garlands skill may be admitted and it is true that he almost succeeds in making his book interesting unfortunately he gives himself away in his preface by asserting that his book is almost but not quite autobiographical and that the boys he depicts are almost but not quite real they are types rather than individuals the author therefore decides to limit his audience and to depress the spirits of some who might have been glad to come in and listen recollections of boyhood discussed between old friends are gloomy topics of conversation in a mixed gathering what hard times they had but how jolly  what good things they had to eat and what fun they used to have  but alas how horribly dull it all is to one who was not with them thirty years ago  besides all this mr garland will believe that he is a bit of a poet and all his chapters of prose are sandwiched with verses this is a sad pity prairie folks is a new edition this book deals with life in the same country here the characters are grown up and the human interest is stronger but the interest is rather special and local there is the same mixture of prose and verse but the poetry refuses to come the journal of william jefferay gentleman is described by john osborne austin the compiler and apparently the publisher as a diary that might have been many works of fiction have been written in the like style the great difficulty consists in mixing fancy and fact in due proportion the diarist writes that he did not meet with any seaserpents on his voyage to new england is not the seaserpent a modern invention  in 1667 he writes that he drank a bottle of good claret at that time what we now term claret had been but seven years in use while the betterknown claret was a compound of honey and spice and a light wine in 1673 the diarist says that a goodly plum pudding rightly set forth with brandy was eaten in remembrance of old england in the middle of the seventeenth century plum porridge was the common designation of what has since been called plum pudding during the rule of the saints both plum porridge and mince pies were forbidden dishes at christmas it was long after 1673 that brandy was used to denote what we now understand by the word the common designation being brandywine which did not imply a product of cognac mr brenton is said to have left 100002 in 1674 is not the sum in excess of any new englanders fortune at that period 1 despite slips of the kind we have noticed the narrative is worthy of praise and the book pleasant to the eye as well as to the mind with sword and crucifix by e s van zile harper  brothers is as may be imagined a romance of war and religion also there is naturally a love interest thrown in with the other ingredients the chief elements that go to the composition of the story are of stuff that should in capable hands lend itself to romantic treatment the time is nearly midway in the seventeenth century when religion versus pleasure had begun to be the guiding motive of the great french louis french jesuits are busy in louisiana converting sunworshipping indians and de la salle the great french explorer and a band of followers are investigating the unknown regions of the giant mississippi a courtier out of favour at versailles but still beruffled feathered and velveted cynical of speech but brave of heart has thrown himself into the expedition he is the hero of the love affair and the rescuer of the lovely julia de aguilar who has fallen into the hands of the heathen religionists other figures indian french or spanish play not uninteresting parts the aged crone noco the converted chatemuc and priests of both religions are amongst these there is a tendency to heaviness in the telling indeed a certain monotony of tone in the beginning makes one rather apt to lay the book aside but if persisted in it offers something of the shape of reward in good scenes and effects of nature and particularly of moonlight,northamerica

  rew jooks the years between the years between mark a period of sixteen yearstime enough for a lyre to rust and time enough for a fire to sink but in lyre and fire the kipling of i919 is still the kipling of 1903 nay even as  the child is father of the man so this last virile volume is the legitimate progeny of  departmental ditties the  little brown baby with a pink string round its stomach born some thirtythree vears ago the little brown baby aforesaid became an infant prodigy also an elanlt terrible and quickly attaining a precocious maturity acquired a style so original and individual as hardly to need the attestation of a signature and the precocious maturity did notas is often the caselead to arrested development and early decay kipling has continued to grow and is growing still and this last volume of poems contains some of the finest and ripest work he has achieved it will not perhaps receive the enthusiastic welcome that greeted his first work but if so it will be because his work is no longer a surprise and can no longer expect to enjoy the popularity of a debutante we have said that the kipling of  the years between is still the kipling of the  departmental ditties but we have also said that kipling has grown he has grown in height and in breadth he is no longer departmental he has become national he is no longer a storyteller he has become a prophet hle has become fiercer too more earnest and sometimes more bitter formerly he had a button on his foil now the button is gone that does not make him more popular it is apt indeed to make him disliked in old days he was accused of banjoplaying now he is compared to a streetcorner revivalist to a billy sunday to a jazzband and to other similar noisy nuisances we admit that he has the vehemence of a revivalist the fervour of a billy sunday and the fury of a jazzband and yet we maintain that even in his fiercest fulminations he remains a great poet and a great artist lie may dance a wardance with the muscular violence of a zulu but he is a nordkin not a zulu his rhythms are perfect and his agility and grace are even more remarkable than his vigour he mat sometimes wield a bludgeon but there is as much music behind it as behind a conductors baton and if he ci ush a hostile skull with a nasmyth hammer in the name of hate with the same hammer lie can crack a chrysalis to liberate a butterfly his anger is always in control and his hand is always steady and his head cool however unsteady and hot his heart may be jazzbands he never emulates he does not condescend to vers libre and ragtime his metres are simple sober and unpretentious and no poet has been less affected by the ataxias of the decadents in brief he is a great artist what could be more artistic than this  they had no heart for the rally and the roar that makes the whalebath smokewhen the great blades cleave and hdlw and leave as on the racing stroke the words go like oars the oars  cleave  and  leave   the years between by rudyard kipling s wd net methuen as if we had them in our own hands that is the work of a great craftsman what could be more artistic than his noble verses to lord roberts  take the last two verses  never again the warwise face the weighed and urgent words that pleaded in the market tilaue pleaded and wtas not heardl  yet from his life a news life springs through all the hosts to comle and glory is the least of things that follow this man home the critics who compare the poet to billy sunday may not appreciate the art of these lines but the simplicity and the inevitability of the words and the quiet ease of the metre are the work of a great poet some critic of kiplingwas it richard le gallienne once affirmed that he could write poetry only in patois but the two poems from which i have quoted and several others in this volume prove that he can also write poetry in classical english very seldom does one find flaws in kiplings workmanship and only a bold bad man would venture to alter many words but still occasionally a flaw does appear most lovers of poetic art would i think agree with me that in the sixth line of  the declaration of london  panting to shame us anew  panting is out of drawing some of the lines too in  the holy war challenge comparison with  sister susies sewing shirts for soldiers and  my boy jack though evidently intended to be a lyric has no lyrical qualities whatsoever to separate kipling the poet from kipling the politician seems difficult for some people but the writer though fiercely dissenting from kiplings political views finds no difficulty at all even though he may combat the poets views he is compelled to admit that he is  a bonnie fechter and cannot deny himto quote his own magnificent phrase that extorted word of praise gasped between lunge and guard the poet is in deadly earnest and his fiery denunciations are sometimes as shining as excalibur as beautiful as the spear of st george the faith in which we stand the laws we made and guard our honour lives and land are given as reward to murder done by night to treason taught by day to folly sloth and spite and we are cast away that is biting that is bitter and it may be unbalanced and untruebut it is poetry and almost as great poetry as sir william watsons invectives in  the purple east polemical poetry is not the greatest poetry but it requires a great poet to write it well and kipling does write it well and we must praise him and yet the magnificent phrase we have already quoted finds a chink in his own armour for alas between lunge and guard  kipling has no breath to praise a foe he is too murderous and too merciless he forgets to be chivalrous were he as great a man as he is great poet we think he might be a greater poet still but kipling is not always fighting his noble poem to lord roberts the tender feeling in  my boy jack the pathos of  recantation show with what skill he can interpret and express the gentler emotions of the heart and though so far he has been mainly  e poete le prophlee et le proesseutr deiiergie des 4 71glosaxois i venture to prophesy that when autumn comes and mellows the poets perfervid genius he will play ever

  the water witch  or the skimmer of the seas by j fenemoue cooper richard bentley new burlington street this is no xxxvi of the standard novels as a nautical romance writer mr cooper is justly celebrated there is certainly a little too much colouring in his descriptions and a little exaggeration in his characters  but this is not felt in the perusal and to a landsman at any time could hardly be perceptible we think the  water witch not quite equal to the  red rover yet it is full of interest life whim and vivacity we like his negroes excessively we assert for we know master snowball upon our ipse dixit that coopers drawing in this respect is all but perfect the plot is the worst part about this novel we may not as we read perceive how violent it is but a little reflection shows us how completely we have given up our judgement into the hands of one who knows so well how to enchant us it would be doing the great talents of mr cooper injustice not to read this novel and still greater to take the measure of his genius by it a work that has been so long before the public cannot call from us for any extended observations lt has been liked and we suppose that the predilection will last for that which has once gained a reputation is affected little by the praise or censure of the critic  the walerjvitch or the skimmerof the seas a tale by the author of the borderers the prairie kc 3 vols 800 we venture to say with historical truth that setting aside skill in prizefighting and the sublime of poetical description greater actions are to be found among the british sailors during one single war than in the whole iliad a seaman is one who lives in danger and exerts every faculty intellectual and corporeal to overcome it he contrives like a conjuror climbs like a monkey swims like a duck and dies like a martyr a fellow upon land who was obliged to support his existence by as many expedients as a sailor would probably become a paltry swindler a domestic cat prowling in a pantry but the generous soul of the seaman remains uncorrupted he is always a lion he will endure a dog in his den but where was the cat who ever did the like with a mouse  the feeling of the nation has ever been favourable to the  cubs of the british lion and we believe that for heroic bravery generous sentiment and uncorrupted patriotism they truly deserve it the skimmer of the seas is in character an argonaut who realises in his contraband profession all the labours of hercules he is a man only in the  homo sum  in all other respects he is a supernatural being and there is another inimitable character called trysail who has not even in the agonies of approaching dissolution a thought distinct from his profession in incident this novel has frequently all the grandeur of an epic poem we have heroes who if they do not wield the thunderbolt of jupiter yet wave the trident of neptune over the obedient ocean and the skimmer of the seas carries off his amphitrite and tritons blow their conches in hymeneal rhapsodies no critic in regard to this fine novel can be addressed with  cease rude boreas blustering railer but long before he has gone through it he and all readers will break out involuntarily into  rule britannia britannia rule the waves,northamerica

  a human trinity by ronald macdonald methuen os this is an interesting storyfine matter expressed finely by convincing personalities the drawing of the characters is free from all affectation and sincerely simply and especially in the case of mary frozier even beautifully handled this study of a really delightful woman is a very careful and intimate one the reader is strongly attracted to her in the first part of the book when she in her quiet studio seems at first almost only a restful background to the vivid youth of anthony le dane but in the last chapter of this part where she comes forward and takes her place beside him it is the woman who fills the picture the reader feels quite grateful to the author for the true dignified and tender treatment of the situation the beginning of the second part contains some of the most charmingly written pages of the book and deals with the fresh and pleasant youth of mary the naturalness of it is remarkable and the descriptions which give the impression of being the outcome of a vivid feeling for the subject rather than the ordered force of words are most convincing this element of intenseness gives to the writing what it lacks in actual style the author is certainly a psychologist of no mean merit and as well as the real insight into the temperament and heart of the woman whom he presents to us as so really lovable in character he gives us an interesting study of the mind of another type of woman through the medium of the unsatisfactory loveaffair between anthony and elmira corder the other characters too are drawn with the feeling of an artist and not those of a mere writer of a story although in this aspect also the book is essentially a tale tolda tale with a very interesting motive which is admirably dealt with in the telling  new novel8 a human trinity by ronald macdonald methuen  co there is only one disadvantage in mr macdonalds novel and we hardly see how it was to be avoided the story is divided into three books and the action of the second book takes place twentyfive years before the action of the first it is explanatory of the storys secret which is hardly a secret from the intelligent reader not that this matters  in fact it lends interest to the narrative to wonder how the beautiful and womanly lady mary is going to face the situation which is being gradually created for her mr macdonald is a frank writer but his frankness is justified by his delicacy of treatment the atmosphere of this tale is liberal and philosophic anthony le dane has a peculiar candour in speaking to his mother which the circumstances of their relationship excuse anthony in fine for one perilously near being a prig behaves magnificently he is one of those creatures rarely achieved in fictiona good young man who is interesting his uncle lord ingestow is of a more usual type which is generally attractive of the chief characters the celebrated explorer bethune convinces us least of all nor is it possible to us quite to forgive or explain his treatment of the girl he loved we notice an admirably drawn american man and an equally admirably drawn american woman we welcome mr macdonald in a higher role he has written a novel of tenderness and power and he must henceforth be reckoned with,northamerica
  litth women or meg jo beth and amy part second by louisa m alcott low  co tms is a cheerful domestic story which appears to be written for the especial use and behoof of the fair sex as it deals with the gradual development of character which takes place in the four young heroines whose earlier years have been described in a previous work the scene is in the united states and our fair countrywomen will find here portrayed a state of society to which they are utterly unaccustomed although at the same time the book abounds with touches of human nature and traits of character which are common to all the world probably but we speak on such topics with diffidence there is something very lifelike in miss jos confession some time after refusing an offer of marriage that perhaps if teddy had tried again she might have said  yesnot because she loved him any more but because she cared more to be loved than when he went away but teddy has now found elsewhere the haven of rest which jo denied him and jo has to content herself with the gift of an awakened but as yet unsatisfied heart it is almost needless to say that miss jo is one of the strongminded race of young women and that she has started in life with the fallacious idea that a mans love is by no means essential to a womans happiness now she has found out her mistake and deigns to make confession to her mother who congratulates her on her progress in natural feelings tm glad of that jo says the calm but sympathising parent for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward jo takes the advice very kindly but assures her mother that her heart has become so elastic lately that it cannot be properly filled as of yore with family affections i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it says poor jo i do says her mother with a meaning smile this seems all very pretty and sensible and it is a fact we believe that young ladies do sometimes get confidential with their mammas on these subjects when softened by a little disappointment miss jo in her early days aspires to literary success the other sisters one artistic one consumptive and so on follow out their several destinies and most of them get  settled  in due time though not so to speak according to the  first intention there is a good deal of innocent fun in the book and there is no lack of quaint transatlantic expressions and turns of thought she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it you must promise not to cut up any pranksdont be a peacock i only moaned a trifle just to keep the other girls company  i dont wish to get raspy so lets change the subject no wonder that young mr lawrence the hero gives up all thought of jo the individual who doesnt wish to  get raspy and seeks happiness with the gentle amy who vows that she is prouder of her handsome husband than of all his money and addresses him with the tender words  dont laughbut your nose is such a comfort to me  the reader will find more truth and more humour in this story than in many works of fiction of a more pretentious character,northamerica

  dile blazed trail by stewart edward white constable  co a titlepage announcement informs us that a previous work by the author of this interesting story of north american pioneer life was likened to the late bret hartes  luck of roaring camp such comparisons are inevitable it would not be easy for any author to produce a story dealing with simla without learning that it reminded some one of mr kipling in the same way the mention of american pine and balsamic scents infallibly suggests to some minds comparison with bret harte as a fact point of view and method of treatment are sounder bases of comparison than subject or locality and in point of view and treatment mr white does not in the least suggest the author of  the heathen chinee he is far more strenuous and proportionately less humorous more earnestly realistic and less picturesquely romantic and withal he has not as yet at all events attained to anything like bret hartes command of language but the blazed trailis none the less a book to read and it will repay the reader a good deal more generously than the majority of everyday modern novels there was a novel published some few months ago which dealt in a healthily ambitious manner  in a would  be epic manner  with the great wheatgrowing industry of the pacific slope mr white has made a similar and a fairly adequate attempt on behalf of the logging industry or timbergetting in north america both subjects smack of great primaeval interests both have lent themselves to large vigorous treatment by the painter in words  the blazed trail forms very spirited and interesting reading  the blazed trail by stewart edward white mr white is of the pioneer and mining camp school of writers that has just lost its greatest figure in mr bret harte in the story which opens at a logging station in michigan we are concerned with the american pioneer  a strong man with a strong mans virtues ancl a strong mans vices the story lacks nothing of the flavour and excitement promised by its title constable os,northamerica
  norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale barton cathcart is the son of a farmer who had from a small beginning worked his way to a position of independence and comparative wealth and from this father barton inherits the strong new england spirit of pride energy and force of character modified by a trait of melancholy derived from his mother his sister alicesilent shy and gentleis until the last vohune little better than a lay figure serving as a foil to the brilliancy of her friend rose wentworth the daughter i of the village doctor who himself plays no mean part in  the drama around these twobarton and roseare col  lected various persons who have little indeed to do with j the furtherance of the plot but not one of whom we would 1 be willing to have left out they are as the seasoning to i the dish barton goes to college without any disclosure of 1 his feelings for rose returning to the village only for occa  sional vacations meanwhile she grows up to womanhood i her character formed partly by her fatheran idealist j owning a sympathy with all things animate and inanimate and partly by her fathers housekeeper agate bisselin  every respect the counterpart of miss ophelia in  uncle 1 toms cabin the same conscientiousness the same in  dustry and the same untiring energy which marked that i indefatigable lady rose under this training became as  near perfection as is possible for mortals barton finally i returns from college to take the head of the norwood ara i demy but rn such a state of religious doubt as to prevent j his speaking to roseunwilling to unsettle her peace of mind by confessing his doubts and yet too honourable to conceal them in the meantime frank esel boses artistcousin and tom heywood a young southern gentleman bid fair to become rivals of barton and indeed in the case of frank bose takes the rather doubtful step of refusing him before he proposes heywood is one of the bestdrawn characters in the booka perfect contrast in all things to bartonfair aristocratic with a sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a gentleman wants a decorous faith a good plain sensible worship and then with a good conscience he turns to the enjoyment of life leaving to the deity andexcuse meto the yankees the management of unfathomable mysteries he makes little progress with rose but the arrows aimed for her find their mark in alice cathcart and she learns to love the bright young southerner an accident which happened while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely broken in upon by the news of the bombardment of fort sumter and we have an animated description of the rapidity with which the war summons was answered our friend barton forms a company of soldiers and is joined by young arthur wentworth roses brother who falls in the first battle hereupon rose resolves to join the army as hospital nurse alice and agate bissel join her and we are carried with them through scenes of carnage till we arrive on the fatal field of gettysburgh where alice finds the dead body of tom heywood and rose also hears of bartons death a letter from him declaring his love being given to her at the same time as the announcement of his death it turns out however that he has been only severely wounded and taken prisoner on the receipt of the intelligence rose is about to make her way to the headquarters of general lee when she hears of bartons escape she follows with her father to the quaker settlement where he has taken refuge and we take leave of general barton for such he had becomeand his wife in the village of norwood apart from the general merits of the story there is much that will interest the english reader as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a representation of american inner life we can thoroughly recommend this work of a man who is in his own person a remarkable representative of the public life of america,northamerica

  mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and his only child to explain their views and positions  papa

delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy

exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his

vividly the enn and tediousn of life in camp the restraint of discipline and the frequent negligenes of volunteers the reckless rush of some to the charge whilst others are skulking behind the terrors of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special qualification we have on our table thc epistle

  captains courageous we have met mr kipling the educationist before now but have never quailed under his eye for so long at a time his latest story is addressed first to the young millionaire youth of america but european youth with limited pocketmoney cannot chuckle very loud for some of them must certainly be included in the  unfortunate young people  who never in all their lives d received a direct ordernever at least without long and sometimes tearful explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the request and who are here warned by the tale of harvey cheyne a softreared lad taught the way he should go by hard living hard work and a ropes end it is a new  sandford and merton harveythe millionaires heir saved from drowning by a fishing schoonerwe like aswe always liked tommy dan is a still smugger harry the amount of moral advice and virtuous example which that young man gives out is appalling granted that the discipline of the ropes end and hard living made a man of the spoilt child of fortune yet the fisbermans son had evidently been frightened by an earlier course of the same into an excellece of conduct and a selfrighteousness as ruinous as it was disagreeable disko troop is the mr barlow of an unphiosophical end of the centuryan admirable preceptor but one who finds his fists a shorter way than arguments to the reason of youth the story is a paan to what seems to be the strongest conviction that mr kipling holdsthe value of strict unreasoning discipline it is a conviction many share but one which harped on outside the services is dangerousto discipline it is also an eulogy of the fishermen of the grand banks of the astuteness the patience the tenacity the cool daring of their  captains courageous we have no doubt that the book tested by these would prove a marvel of information and accuracy the daily adventures in calm and gale the slow appren ticeship to the work the conversations of the men the code of bauklaws the technical phrases are explained and described with a patience which alas i is not contagious if we had ever been on one of the schooners for a day no doubt it would delight us to have the life reproduced photographically but to outsiders it is more instructive than enticing it all sounds very accurate much of it is certainly very dull the  actuality of mr kiplings former stories was not explained by mere technical correctness imagination uade his facts live  captains courageos a story of the grand bmit by rudyard kipfing with l lustratious by j w tabu a mac ulb and imagination is left out here indeed though the book must be the result of much difficult learning and hard experience it has evidently no pretensions to be anything but a slight affair judged by literary standards if it incites some lads to throw off the yoke of overindulgent parents and hunger after the toils that will make them men it has hit its only mark  reviews the new kipling captains courageous by rudyard kipling macmillan  co mr kipling is flashing a new facet upon us he has become the archimandrite of technicalities  the inspired journalist who must see things from the inside it is now his passion to grasp details to understand the work of mens hands what they think and how they act in the making of things in the guise of stories he writes bluebooks upon locomotives and upon ships giving life to the inanimate parts and firm characterisation to the workmen that control them those and they number many who are following his career closely read these technical stories diligently with astonishment at his grasp of detail and admiration of his power of marshalling and vivifying commonplace incidents but to say that they are generally attractive is to say the thing that is not these technical stories need more attention than the ordinary reader of fiction cares to give there are parts of captains courageous where the mind wearies and the interest flags nevertheless it is well to persevere and those who do so will be rewarded for the workmanship is finevery fineif somewhat overlaid  mr kipling may have had either of two motives in his mind when he set himself to write this story let there be a boy he may have said to himself the son of an american multimillionaire a spoilt boy a nuisance and a cub but with the right stuff under the crust of his caddishness i will plump him down among mon honest sailormen godfearing white all through who cure whims with hard work and affectation with a ropeend through tins ordcri he shall pass and he shall come out a man or mr kipling may have mused ill tell of polyglot folk  hairy newfoundlanders howling portuguese reckless galway menwho fish in the deep sea on the grand banks of newfoundland even to the hoarseroaring virgin ill give a six months intinerary of their buxom schooners dancing dories and the hardy orews that wrest a living from the seasfor i know i know it allthe dories that are sunk by the swift liners and the auction held over the drowned sailors kit and to make the yarn palatable ill drift into it the story of a boy and the sea shall be his master and water and men together shall buffet and lick the cub into something good but the real yarn shall be the story of the men who go down to the deep sea to catch cod if the evolution of harvey cheyne the multimillionaires boy was the motive of the story it might have been told in a quarter the length captains courageous need have been no longer tuan loveo women again and again mr kipling delays the march of the story to rollick with extraneous incidentspages of themprofoundly well done but not vital more than twothirds of the book are allocated to cod to the voyaging of the were here of gloucester mass and the doings of her crew codfishing may not be your hobby but you must grip the paragraphs line by line if you would learn what technicalromantic writing is at its beet even then some passages are ill to digest this for instance   hi shouted manuel stooping to the fish and bringing one up with a finger under its gill and a finger in its eye he laid it on the edge of the pen the knifeblade glimmered with a sound of tearing and the fish slit from throat to vent with a niok on either side of the neck dropped at long jacks feet    the cods liver dropped in the basket another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying and the empty fish slid aoross to uncle salters who snorted fiercely there was another sound of tearing the baokbone flew over the bulwarks and the fish headless gutted and open splashed in the tub a landsman is quite at sea with a description like the following except perhaps the last two lines  she was running before the witd yawing frightfully her staysail let down to act as a sort of extra foresail scandalised they oall it and her foreboom guyed out over the side her bowspritcocked up like an oldfashioned frigates her jibboom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond further repair and as she hove herself forward and sat down on her broad tail she looked for all the world like a blouzy frouzy bad old woman sneering at a decent girl but an illuminative picture like this is not easily forgotten  at the first glance a silverywhite ghost rose bolt upright from the oily water and sighed a wend whistling sigh harvey started back with a shout but dan only laughed  grampus said he  beggin fer fishheads they upeend that way when theyre hungry breath on bim like the doleful tombs haint he p a horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of oil sank and the water boiled oilily mr kipling glosses nothing in his descriptions he has a genius for fixing the dramatic moment in a scene how convincing how photographic is this whale  the deep fizzed like freshly opened sodawater and cod men and whales together flung in upon the luokless bait harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of dans net but in all the wild tumult he noticed and never forgot the wicked set little ejesomething like a circus elephants eyeof a whale that drove along almost level with the water and so he said winked at bim as the reader ploughs his way through the book it becomes plainer that mr kipling is more interested in the were here and the fortunes of her crew than in the growth of the millionaires boy so great is the authors delight to find himself aboard the schooner so avid is he to spread himself over technicalities that he has somewhat neglected to express the nuances that must have gone to produce the change in harvey cheyne the miracle works all too quickly some plain speaking a blow on the nose the wave of a knotted ropeand he is a man finally the were here returns to gloucester mass and harvey telegraphs his safety to his parents who are away out at  their raw new palace  in san diego old cheyne bids him meet them in boston and the next step in the story both for the reader and in the hoary convention of fiction is that meeting between parents and an only son who was lost and is found but mr kipling delays the meeting for several pages to describe the millionaires race ngninst tim ncrops america its nniazingly well done but is it artthe art of fiction still we would not have missed that journey for a world of pedestrian novels properly constructed on the best french model thus does genius override law by making another law oonvinoing us of the legality of the act and demonstrating its fitness with a triumphant example mr kipling finds nought common on the earth he takes the common things by choice and they become distinguishedeven cod  captains courageous literature by rudyard kipling macmillan  jo the novel is tending to replace the treatise and the essay is it also going to take the place of the volume of travel and the guidebook mr kiplings latest venture ia a description of life on the cod banks of newfoundland as seen through the eyes of a youngster who has fallen overboard from an atlantic liner incidentally by the training he receives during his three months stay among the fishermen he is made a man of and saved from becoming a plutocratic cad mr kipling presses this slight and somewhat obvious moral rather unduly but the main purpose of the book as indicated by the subtitle is to describe the life of the  fullblooded banker with admirable fullness mr kipling has achieved this end and added another portion of the globe to his ever  widening empire by rights both of conquest and discovery the book is a series of studies in the psychology of them that go down to the sea in ships  a succession of portraits of the very varied crew that go to make up the contingent of a fishing schooner from manuel the portugee who takes up harvey cheyne to disko troop skipper of the schooner the reader learns to know them all no not all for there is a somewhat theatrical took on board a full negro answering to the name of macdonald who speaks gaelic and has the gift of second sight he is so improbable that he must have been drawn from life the relations of the skippers brother who is a farmer at heart and as mr kipling would say a bad one at that with a moravian preacher who had been driven mad by seeing his whole family swept away in a flood form a pathetic idyl worked out with considerable subtlety mr kipling has used a larger canvas than he has hitherto been accustomed to except in  the light that failed if his method is still episodical he shows increased mastery in posing his groups and he may yet write his novel but this is not it it is something other and more difficult in its way it might perhaps be described as a sociological study put dramatically or perhaps one might say novelistically if there were such a word now and again we have novels of this type whose aim is to describe a state of society rather than the imagined fortunes of particular individuals george eliots  middlemarch was in the main such an attempt and more recently mr zangwill has bestowed the shape of a tale on his account of the london ghetto similarly much of the work of mr barrie and his imitators is rather devoted to a dramatic presentation of a certain social state than to the novel pure and simple mr kipling himself gained his reputation by making known to us in a series of vivid sketches the warp and woof that go to make up the particoloured web of indian life it was impossible for him to do justice to the complexities of indian cultitr in a single sketch but the simpler relations of life on the bank have proved capable of being treated on one canvas and that of no groat dimensions but in the compass of two hundred pages for the rather poor illustrations take up forty pages mr kipling has managed to sketch for us both the life and the environment of a cod fisherman off the newfoundland banks one of the points of interest about a book such as this is the study of the art by which the writer makes his readers roalise the atmosphere and tone of a strange mode of life in the first place there is the difficulty of the technical terms if the writer does not use them he loses all semblance of reality if he does use them the reader will not understand them it is not mr kiplings way to avoid using technical terms experts indeed are inclined to hint that his use of them is often more according to zeal than to knowledge his pages are simply peppered with them on the present occasion and the readers for the oxford dictionary will find plenty of new material in  captains courageous at first sight they look repellent and incomprehensible enough torn from their context they would be absolutely unintelligible what for instance is the exact process meant by  dressing  down or  under  running a trawl or being  scrowged upon  what are the shape and use ofa topping lift pawlpost hogyoke gobstick muckle what particular infirmities are referred to if a man is described as a  logy  baulky or  deader limpsey  idler  how does a thing wiggle swedge off snarl up  slatt    nubbles  kenches  schloop  sunscalds  barnyard tramps  cockly swells a judgmatic tweak yohoes  burgess  modelled haddock er are a few other verbal felicities which aid in giving a local colour to mr kiplings pages yet replaced in their contexts there is scarcely a single one of these which does not become comprehensible a word or two of explanation is occasionally thrown in without any loss of dramatic force since the derelict youngster is supposed to be learning to know the ropesanother expression the literal meaning of which is brought home to the mind of the reader in a very vivid way we have nothing but admiration for the manner in which mr kipling has solved this part of his problem it says much for his skill in this regard that a careful reader can go through page after page filled with technicalities of this sort without the need of a glossary having by this means got his reader as it were actually onboard and familiarised him with his human and physical surroundings mr kipling proceeds to give the atmosphere of his picture bya series of literary seapieces which constitute the value of the book from an artistic point of view never in english prose has the sea in all its myriad aspects with its sounds and sights and odours been reproduced with such subtle skill as in these pages one could compile from them a series of thumbnail sketches as effective in their way as the river scenes of mr whistler the following catena though it by no means exhausts the number of passages that might be quoted to illustrate this quality of the book is sufficient to indicate it the low sun made the water all purple and pinkish with golden lights on the barrels of the long swells and blue and green mackerel shades in the hollows the shadow of the masts and rigging with the neverfurled ridingsail rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight and the pile of bah by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver there was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging jibboom while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn pale waves whispering and lipping one to the other up and up the focsle climbed yearning and surging and quivering and then with a clear sicklelike swoop came down into the sens he could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch and there was a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above like a volley of buckshot followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawsehole a grunt and squeal of the windlass a yaw a punt and a kick and the were here gathered herself together to repeat the motions a gentle breathing swell three furlongs from trough to barrel would quietly shoulder up a string of variously painted dories they hung for an instant a wonderful frieze against the skyline and their men pointed and hailed next moment the open mouths waving arms and bare chests disappeared while on another swell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in a toy theatre  harvey being anything but dull began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wavetops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing  the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purpleblue cloudshadows  the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise  the folding and packing away of the morning mists wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors the salty glare and blaze of noon  the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead flat square miles  the chilly blackening of everything at the days end  and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight when the jibboom solemnly poked at the low stars and harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook this last passage in particular shows with what a few lines mr kipling produces his effects in many other ways as well as this he may be described as a phil may in black on white this book then may be pronounced a decided success as regards the aim which the author appears to have had before him mr kipling it would appear aspires to be the hogarth as well as the tyrteeus of the british empire and that he has in him the qualities to enable him to play the former rdle his angloindian sketches and the present book amply testify but literature is a jealous mistress and hardly allows of a divided allegiance whatever patriotism may gain from books like the present it is to be feared letters must lose,northamerica
   melbourne house by the author of the wide wide world nisbet there is something pleasant in this little book ia spite of the tenuity to which the story is drawn out the characters are distinct and like life they have each their individual aspect and are real human beings but we should hesitate before we placed the book in the hands of a child and finally decide not to do bo it is repugnant to the filial loyalty that ought to be cultivated and guarded in children to set before them a heroine whose claim to their admiration lies in setting up her own judgement again st that of her parents and in being not only much wiser but much more religious than they superior to them in every respect daisy is a very charming little girl of six years old who having been to church wishes to put in practice what the bas heard there her parents are both worldly her mother especially so she is a violent unreasonable woman towards whom even in these early years miss daisy has to exercise  diplomacy daisy wishes to be religious and having read the commandment about the  sabbathday the refuses to sing a song out of an opera when desired to do so by her mother because she does not feel it to be right she suffers very severe punishment both from her father and mother like a little spartan and behaves like a young christian martyr in a heathen household she rejoices in a fractured ankle because it relieves her from another cruel flogging at the hands of her mother on the disputed point of singing a song on sunday which she will not give up now daisy acted up to her light and showed a high sense of principlewe do not complain of her but we do complain of the author for putting the father and mother hopelessly in the wrongsetting them in a cruel and persecuting light and making a young child rise up in judgement against them bothit is bad teaching mrs randolph the mother is utterly disagreeable and worldly in all she says and does the father is a little better but the aunt is vulgar daisy alone is the preacher of goodness and the exemplar for everybody it is not a good moral to teach children the office of a parent is sacred at the age of six years a spirit of reverent obedience to parents pastors and masters is better than any amount of doctrinal accuracy,northamerica
  a little traitor to the south by cyrus i townsend brady macmillan co american novels according to the present fashion are not complete without a bit of history mr brady describes his little book very well as a wartime comedy with a tragic interlude this interlude contains the true story of a daring exploit in which seven southerners lost their lives on board a sort of submarine torpedo boat after succeeding in blowing up one of the enemys vessels the exploit is related with spirit and is very cleverly worked into the lovestory which furnishes the comedy the comedy at the end is perhaps a little overdone but mr brady compresses the whole thing into a reasonable space and mixes grave and gay so as to furnish a highly agreeable story which is both exciting and amusing,northamerica

  the auction block by rex bcach 6s hodder  stoughton this is in some ways the best story mr rex beach has yet given us it breaks new ground and instead of carrying us away as is usual with him into the outlands on the verge of civilisation it unfolds a vivid and very human story of modern new york loreli knight the beautiful country girl whose brother and parents secure an engagement for her in a fashionable theatre with the avowed intention of seeing that she captures a millionaire husband who can be made to maintain them all is admirably portrayed and the narrative of her experiences among the richest and fastest of new yorks rich and fast set is varied picturesque and literally alive with interest so set about with snares and temptations loreli preserves a charm and force of character that enable her to win through to an end that is sharply and beautifully in contrast with the unideal life from which she at last emerges the realism of the book is good so too is the romance of it there is plenty of sensation and excitement but nothing is pleasanter in it perhaps than the human note that sounds through all the story and dominates its closing chapters she was a wife   another possessed her from the auction block by rex beach hodder  stoughton  the auction block tt j j  by rex beach hodder  stoughton 6s  tim auction block  has real power it is a study of luxurious living in new york and it shows the inner working of the rich mans insatiate thirst for pleasure satisfiedor rather maintainedby the wildest extravagance in festivities night rioting drink of the utmost variety and extent and women who go more than halfway to meet the desires which alone can give them some joy or at least excitement as well as livelihood the story has as its chief thread the career of one particular girl who marries the son of a wealthy man breaks him of his habit of drink and stimulates him to work and become prosperous in spite of the poverty imposed upon him by his parents wrath eventually reconciliation with the parents is effected but it is the writer of the story who brings this to pass rather than any genuine and natural development indeed this chief thread has no real importance for the reader as compared with the picture given of a state of society appalling in its corruption the society is that touched upon in  the jungle and it deserves studynay exacts it we talk about civilization progress reform and the like  but these are mere catchwords in the face of unlimited wealth and the unbounded raw appetites which it serves any book which exposes the problem of this world clearly and fearlessly is of value  the jungle did excellent service in this way  the auction block  does not rank so high but it is a fine work and we trust that it will reach a wide public,northamerica
  a fascinating traitor by col r h savage ro uti ed ge sonsthe lively author of  my official wife need not claim much in the way of literary style but he succeeds very well in interesting and mystifying his readers with elaborate details of plot and circumstance and he has made a thorough study of all the arts and contrivances of the cosmopolitan adventurer to make a pricis of the plot of  a fascinating traitor would occupy many an hour of hard work but the authors plan of italicising all the important statements in the narrative as well as in the conversation relieves one of a great deal of trouble and a reader who has any taste for the sort of adventures that col savage describes must admit that the author gives full measure though he appears to know many parts of the world he is perhaps at his best in this book in his descriptions of angloindian life at delhi,northamerica

  fiction the custom of the country utl1  s  by edith i   vvnarton piacmnuan  uo the modem american young woman with her wondrous selfassurance her arrogance towards the male creatures who support her and her physical perfections has often been portrayed in fiction but it has been left to mrs wharton to expound her whole significance in  the custom of the countrv we are introduced to a state of society as chaotic crude and purely imitative as that of hayti or liberia but full of force and held together by a curious patriotism from this strange soil there rises like a flower undine spragg whose history is the subject of the book the daughter of a leading citizen of apex undine was engaged while yet a child to a young dentist of that city and ran away about the same time with one elmer moffatt an adventurer whom she married and divorced in a fortnight all this was no more detrimental to her maiden pride than water on a ducks back she had quite forgotten the adventure by the time her parents on a rise of fortune moved to new york to a splendid suite in the stentorian hotel she married into one of the best oldfashioned new york families not mentioning her previous marriage and divorce but the real aristocracy of her new relatives soon disgusted her attracted by the vulgar splendour of some millionaires she made decided overtures to one of them forsook her child divorced her husband but for once miscalculated the millionaire for reasons of his own declined to marry her and she retired to paris in a state of temporary disillusionment reviving presently she married a french count and in the course of time divorced him when she finally joined hands with the same elmer moffattnow a multimillionairewith whom she had eloped from apex city in her teens it is of course a monstrous record from the sentimental standpoint but mirs wharton by avoiding the least hint of sentiment and laying stress upon the sequence of environment upbringing character has made her heroine a natural and pathetic figure she succeeds in winning for a cold and selfish character the kindly sympathy which comes of understandingan achievement of which any novelist might well be proud undine spragg is always striving for the best obtainable as she conceives it it is her misfortune that her aims are all material and egotistic no sooner has she attained a social height than her minds eye discerns another yet more radiant and desirable this explains her strange inconstancy in the married state she has no scruples fails to see how any one on earth can justly blame her for discarding men who do not give her everything she wants with the readiness her father showed for abner e spragg whose  private rule of conduct was as simple as his business morality was complicated and whose lips were often  busy with a phantom toothpick had served her will at home   why havent we taught our women to take an interest in our work   inquires a cynical observer in the book simply because we dont take enough interest in them the slaving is no argument against the indifference to slave for women is part of the old american tradition lots of people give their lives for dogmas they ve ceased to believe in then again in this country the passion for making money has preceded the knowing how to spend it and the american man lavishes his fortune on his wife because he does not know what else to do with it  where does the real life of most american men lie in some womans drawingroom or in their offices  the passage is suggestive of a curious parallel between the freest of all women and circassian pets when on the last page of the book undine learned that as a woman who had been divorced she could not hope to be ambassadress in london she burst into an angry laugh and the blood flamed up into her face  i never heard of anything so insulting she cried as if the rule had been invented to humiliate her the cry rings truly of the spoilt circassian mrs whartons latest work is no mere entertaining story it is a courageous and at the same time sympathetic study of americans  notes on novels  these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser the country is japan on which mrs fraser is known to be an authority in this volume are tales of new japan all with enchanting backgrounds tokyo is a garden says for example the author in the first of them in which a city has grown up by accident and the flowers have the best of it still in the foreground is the stormy play of passions mrs fraser can handle her pen as indeed a sister of mr marion crawford should hutchinson 6s  the custom of the country by edith wharton 6s macmillan the heroine of this american tale is a muchmarried person undine spragg finally weds a man to whom as a girl she had been married clandestinely and from whom she had been separated forcibly by her parents then the second husband came on the scene marriage for him turns out to be a tragedy he commits suicide when undine deserts him a french nobleman is the ladys next husband and finally mr moffatt who is now a wealthy man mrs wvhartons irony calls this rapid mating the custom of her country but she is too fine an artist to exaggerate the point one of the notable features in her novel is the artistic restraint she has shown on two occasions she depicts the troubles inflicted by this divorcecustom upon the child but the pathos is not overdrawn again she draws with admirable skill the parents of undine people who have made money rapidly and come to new york in order to let their daughter get into society the description of mrs spraggs loneliness in the new york hotel of her pathetic isolation and helplessness is one of the best things in the story but it is written without overcolouring mrs wharton uses these scenes and situations in order to bring out the character of her heroine and the characterisation is subtle clever and convincing it is an unlovely plot nmrs wharton does not conceal the inner misery of a woman who is inferior to all the men she marries thanks to her greedy love of pleasure but no moral is drawn the story is left to tell its own warning it is this which makes it effective there is less bitterness than in  the house of mlirtlh though the situation is practically the same but the subordination of the satire to the artistic construction of the tale is equally prominent hardly any of mrs whartons recent novels displays quite such unity and penetration as this incisive study of the modern american woman of fashion  the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson 6s it was inevitable that mrs hugh fraser having made some reputation with a diplomatists wife in japan should forthwith collect some short stories and republish them as a book but it is a uttle unfair since there is no outward indication that the volume is made up of five tales and that  the custom of the country  is the title of only one of them and that not the first it is also rather a pity mrs fraser as she has shown us in her earlier work knows japan weu sympathises with its people and is we use the phrase in a compumentary sense an agreeable rattle but these qualities though they suffice for a couple of volumes of observant gossip are not enough for the building of one good short story mrs fraser to teu the truth does not play the game she breaks the rules with an insouciance which almost disarms criticism we will take an example from the titlestory we are sitting with thornton the hero on a balcony watching the father and uncle of the japanese girl whom he loves they are talking confidentially in the opposite house and thornton and we want to know what they are saying obviously thornton and we should learn no more than we can hear or see this is how mrs hugh fraser cheats at the game 44 but now rinzo san he said  wiu you not ask me why i came  44 for a good and brotherly purpose i ana sure replied the other trying to look unconcerned and filling up the teacups with a trembling hand  for a better purpose than yours was when you left us said his brother 441 come to undo the wrong you did and to offer ybu reconciliation and friendship from all the family 44 what am i to pay for such precious things kato san p  asked rinzo eying him suspiciously and stroking his cbio such an offer from such a quarter seemed more duvgnous than a threat 44 there is nothing to pay between brothers kato spoke as loftily as confucius could have done 44 there will be his hotel bill thought old rinzo but then ht was comforted fur kato evidently wanted something and was disposed to be polite about it the points we have italicised could not possibly have been observed by a stranger sitting on the balcony opposite mrs fraser must really learn the rules and stick to them for the breach that may pass in a novel is blatant in the short story further we would beg her not to use praughfas the past tense of  preach even in fun and finally we must point out that even if there were such a word as  anthrophoby an  anthrophobic woman could not denote a female who disliked men those who know nothing of the elements should not try to coin words  fiction american divorce i the custom of the country by edith wharton macmillan and co 6s a dmirers of mrs edith whartons books have no need to be told that any story bearing her name is sure to possess many remarkably good passages that the style is excellent and that the author knows well how to illustrate and adorn her theme yet in spite of all the custom of the country cannot be said to be a great success as a novel there is a purpose in the story a by no means undesirable and probably a necessary one but the reader feels that at times it very nearly overrides the story itself which in a novel is an error easy american divorce is the theme mrs wharton has chosen and undine spragg a beautiful girl of plebeian origin is the one upon whom the author has fixed to show the horribleness and evils of the diabolical system allowed by some of the american states it may be that undine is a type of woman evolved by the artificial surroundings of a debased society but it seems almost incredible that any society or any training could make even an american woman so heartless and callous a creature as undine is represented to be she is beautiful certainly but that is all she is never presented as a fascinating woman yet she has in her trainafter her first runaway marriage of a fortnights durationa man belonging to one of new yorks oldest and best families ralph marvell whose wife she becomes peter van degen the vulgar husband of ralphs cousin a young french marquis of old family her third matrimonial ventureand her girlhoods husband who eventually becomes her last the courtship period in each case is passed over very lightly it is with the married life and the break in each case that the book is concerned and these periods are admirably dealt with ralph and the french aristocrat have much in common each is guided by custom traditions and high honour in their private and public lifeobservances which the young american beauty never for a moment grasps or understands the only intuition she possesses is to further her own aggrandisement although she pathetically just misses her desired goal every time after doing her best to ruin the two families into which she marries she at last finds her level with her first husband now more than a millionaire thus the end of undines ventures is reached so far as the reader is allowed to know of them that the book has interest no one will deny and if it does nothing else it serves to show the scandalous state of the american divorce laws although mrs whartons purpose would have been better served had she presented a character in which the reader could more easily have believed,northamerica

  swallow barn or a sojourn in virginia an american tale 4 vols 12mo london newman and co 1832 this appears to be a reprint of a tale originally published in america and is ushered in by an introductory epistle indited bv one mark littleton to his friend zachary huddlestone esq of new york explaining his reasons for visiting swallow barn in virginia the residence of their common friend ned hazard the four volumes of which the present work is composed comprise a full and particular account of the sayings employments and amusements of the several parties inmates and visitors at swallow barn the work before us is written with considerable vivacity of humour by a man of no common talents and we have derived much pleasure from a perusal of this virginian tale which in adldition to the enjonmient of its airiness and elasticity of style and the pleasant variety of its characters affords us an insight into country manners anl customs in america with which we were heretofore but imperfectly alcquainted we cannot lass over without commendation the animated description of a hunt after  an oppossum up a gumtree  and we regret not a little that we have it not in our power to extract many passages which wouli fully justify a very high praise of this work certain it is there are descriptions here which fall very little short of those so much admired in the works of our own

the court was the marshalling of the grand jury to whom the usual charge was delivered this office was assigned by the court to one of the members of the bar a young practitioner who did not fail to embellish the summary of duties which he unfolded to their view with a plentiful garniture of rhetoric notwithstanding the portentous exaggeration of the solemnity of the occasion aud thu multitudinous grave topics which were urged upon the grand inquest it seems that this quintessence of the freehold dignity was sadly puzzled to lind employment in any degree commensurate with the exaltedness of its function it is said that the jurors revolved in their minds the whole list of national grievances one party suggested the idea of presenting the established mode of electing the president of the united states as a grievance to the good people of the county another thought of a formal denunciation of the tariff a few advocated an assault upon the supreme court but all were happily brought into a harmonious concurrence in the design of presenting a madcap ragamuffin by the name of jemmy smith for disturbing the peace of a camji meeting by drinking whisky and breeding a riot within the confines of the conventicle accordingly after an hours deliberation upon these various suggestions they returned to the courtroom with a solitary bill made out in due form against jemmy and this matter constituting the sum total of their business for the term they were thereupon discharged with the thanks of the court for the able and vigilant administration of their inquisitorial duties jemmy smith had anticipated this act of authority and was now in court ready to stand his trial isle had already selected his counsel  a flowery and energetic advocate whose strength lay according to the popular opinion in his skill in managing a jury the name of this defender of jemmys fame was taliaferro pronounced tolliver or as it was called for shortness toll hedges

conceited fashion which nevertheless gave some indications of having been recently slept in as it was plentifully supplied with down from a featherbed he was conspicuous also for an old straw hat that had been fretted at the rim by a careless habit in handling it this learned counsel had apparently been keeping his vigils too strictly the night before for bis eyes were red and his face inflamed his frame had all the morning languor of a sedulous nightwatcher and altogether toll did not appear to be in the best condition to try his case however he had now taken his seat at the bar and close beside him sat his client jemmy smith an indescribably swaggering saucy blade who had the irreverence to come into court without coat or waistcoat and to show a wild grinning disorderly countenance to his peers whilst the gentleman who conducted though case for the commonwealth was giving a narrative of jemmys delinquencies to the jury and was vituperating that worthys character in good set terms toll was to all appearance asleep upon his folded arms resting on the desk before him when the charge was fairly explained one witness was called to support it this individual was pretty much such a looking person as jemmy himself he was rather downfaced and confused in his demeanour before the court and particularly shabby in his exterior but he told a plain straightforward story enough in though main and his evidence went the full length of all the traversers imputed enormities the truth was  jemmy had certainly broke into the camp and played some strange antics considering the sanctity of the place but during all this time taliaferro hedges esq maintained his recumbent position except now and then when jemmy feeling himself pinched hy the testi mony would recline his head to whisper in his counsels ear which act would rouse him enough to bring upon jemmy a rebuke that was generally conveyed by pushing him off and an injunction to be quiet at length the whole story was told and bad enough it looked for jemmy  the attorney for the commonwealth now informed mr hedges that the witness was at his disposal at this toll completely roused himself and sitting bolt upright

  cease firg by mary johnston 6s constable taken by itself miss mary johnstons new novel  cease firing may seem a ragged piece of work it is likely at times to perplex a reader unacquainted with the authors last book and some misunderstanding would we think have been prevented if the new volume had been plainly put forward as a continuation of  the long roll it is really the second part of a trilogy which is not yet completed slowly and carefully miss johnston is composing a great panorama of the american civil war taken from an unusual point of view a daughter of the south descended from a famous fighting stock she writes with intense and yet restrained partisanship nevertheless she treats the north with the courteous fairness becoming in a virginian of the old school but sadly lacking in the multitude of modern american novelists who take the popular triumphant side in some respects she is rather more of an historian than a novelist in the fine and important work on which she is now engaged the story in  cease firing  is a mere thread which scarcely connects together all the chapters of the book what miss johnston aims at depicting and succeeds in depicting is the whole life of a dying nation for the south was a nation distinct from the north in manners spirit and tradition and this distinction was the fundamental cause of the civil war properly handled the slavery question might have been settled without an armed conflict for a majority of the planters was inclined to some pacific scheme of emancipation but between the industrial democratic northerners and the agricultural gentry of the south there was a division as deep as that which once separated our puritans and cavaliers  free government says one of the characters in cease firing is founded on the consent of the governed and every community strong enough to establish and maintain its independence has a right to assert it my father fought great britain in defence of that principle but being behind the north in industrial power the planters were at last defeated and broken and it is as a tragic picture of a highspirited people in their day of irretrievable disaster that miss johnstons new work fills and touches the mind it is not an historical novel built from books and deriving all its animating power from the writers imagination the author has woven her fine work out of the living memories of her relatives and friends of the older generation the result is a peculiar vividness of treatment the whole struggle of the south is seen in so intimate a way that the living fighting desperate nation becomes the real hero and the individual figures count for what they represent more than for what they singly are the characterization is always clear and interesting but it is merged in the larger subject,northamerica

  a master of life by philip gibbs 6s cassell titus harsnett the leading character of mr philip gibbs new novel is a kind of hamlet of the modern industrial world burdened not with the purple or with revenge but with introspection hesitation a conscience that speaks of duty to those who have helped to make the huge fortune of twoandahalf millions left to him by his father the artistic temperament and a mother who drops her  hs and can no more drop her servantlike devotion to her late husbands memory than she can enter into the humanitarian ideas of her only son one feels that but for the constant coaching from his old tutor gerard langbaine and his cousins wife nmrs jack lavington titus would have made a hopeless mess of his life and his inheritance as it is titus and mrs lavington betray a woeful ignorance of the ways of a censorious world and pay very bitterly for their blindness mr gibbs is one of the most interesting of our younger novelists and in his latest book he displays a marked increase of power power of maintaining the readers attention power of depicting character of displaying tne warp and woof of modern political and social dife there are constant flashes of epigram particularly in the pages devoted to the philanthropic duchess and the style is sustained throughout at a high level it was perhaps a pity to make will jennings accept the bribe but if there is cold cynicism here there is cynicism enough in the portrait of the  living image of nell gwynne who  would rob a graveyard or bleed a millionaire to death or flirt in a disgraceful way with satan himself for  the sake of her precious societies the denouement is cleverly disguised and as much as anything else sets a mark of distinction on a book which will make every reader eager for its successor,northamerica
  john halifax gentleman by the author of the head of the family c 3 vols hurst ft blackettjohn halifax is an improvement on the last novel by the same author of plot there is not much but there is a design which is followed without haste and without weariness john halifax the hero is intended to be the type of a man who from the lowest depths of destitution works his way up to fortune and a position in society there are many such men more than the world ever heard ofbut john halifax cannot be accepted as the type of such he is too much idealized a boy who begins by being a farm servant until he is fourteen and who then is employed in a tanyard to fetch the skins from market might possess all the fine characteristics bestowed on john halifaxhis selfreliance his energy his integrity his passion for selfimprovementbut he would nothe could notattain the bearing and manners of a fine gentleman he could not by mere effort of selfculture attain the tone of good society the real men who have raised themselves from nothing polish as they rise and as their intercourse with persons of breeding and education extendsthat is if they have an innate refinement of their own otherwise they remain coarse and unpolished at the end as at the beginning amongst the orientals the conventional manners of the great and those of the meanest are of the same qualitya watercarrier or a donkeydriver may dine with a grand vizier without shocking any of the external punctualities but in england it is different and john halifax is made producible in a drawingroom without ever having seen any one better than himself this is the mistake of the book  the authoress has been too anxious to make her hero perfect and has by so doing thrown a fictitious rosecoloured tint over a character that could have dispensed with any such aid the story is however interesting the attachment between john halifax and his wife is beautifully painted as are the pictures of their domestic life and the growing up of the children the strife between the two brothers when they discover they are each attached to the same object is vigorously drawn and the conclusion of the book is beautiful and touching there is a blind child muriel very prettily done but she might have died earlier with advantage to the bookher part is too long drawn out the friendship between john halifax and phineas fleoher is well managed and opens a source of interest and emotion which we wonder is not oftener and more efficiently used in novels friendship has capabilities of interest quite as deep and as universal as love only it requires more knowledge to handle it nobly and adequately  fiction ai ijohn hlalifax gentleman by the author of the i s  a s head of the family c a new edition reviseu london hurst and blackett  this was miss mulochs last and best novel it obtained an immediate and deserved popularity insor much that the publishers have been tempted to give to it the rare honour of a reissue in a single volume at a small price so that all who have not vet enjoyed the reading of it may do so without borrowing it for it is one of those books which mav be put upon the shelf for permanent preservation it is not one of the novels of the season but a fiction of enduring worth  polit halilfax gentleman by the author of  the head  of the family  olive c c three vols hurst and blackett this is a very good and a very interesting novel its faults are but excesses in a certain kind of merit and arise out of full occupation of the author in the subject and a rare intensity of purpose perhaps its two chief merits maiy admit of being reckoned as a fault it is designed to trace the career from boyhood to age of a perfect man a christian gentleman and it abounds in incident both well and highly wrought but the carrying of such a hero through a lifelong series of trials and showing him in each heroical suggests impossible perfection john halifax is indeed much such a hero to his author as was thaddous of warsaw to miss porter with the one favourable szceptiou that although he is representd as a godlike man h is wi ontialwlyis not once evendirectly honoured with that this john appears first as a boy of unknown parentage fiked up out of the streets yet not without so much concesion pid to claims of blood as to leave some indication of his rwing gentle born he is picked up by a quaker tanner and obfl into friendship by the quakers crippled son phineas fletcher the same who in his old age is supposed to be the writer of this his instructive history john is a perfect servant and a perfect friend he errs once only when out of the perfection and strength of his expanding intellect and isehood and before falling in love he allows a yearning for action beyond the sphere of the tanyard in a country villge to carry him with his friend phineas to the next town to see a play but for that escapade he atones by submitting to the displeasure of his master and by obeying so well t order to see no more of his friend as not to come near him for two whole years at the end of which time he has more than redeemed his character as a youth he quells rioters by christian conduct and is the best guardian of his masters property he falls in love and is the most highmindea of lovers then he becomes a model husband then a model father and afterwards prospering in life he becomes a model master model neighbour model landowner and squire in every relation he is sorely tried apparently by every form of trial that the author could invent and by each in an exceedingly severe form but out of every trial john halifax gentleman rises sublime his later trials are all born for many years under the dispensation of a heart disease angina pectoris which is brought on by violent emotion and always at risk of life when his last troubles are over and except the one child in the churchyard all are happy his disease proves fatal and his faithful wife nestles against his corpse and dies now whatever fault there is in such a book as this arises as we have said out of the very worthiness and earnestness of its design but conceding its obvious defects we have to say that throughout it is conceived in a high spirit and written with great abilitybetter than any former work we think of its deservedly successful author there is much delicate pathos there are charming touches of nature scattered about there are many picturesmoor scenes bome scenes scenes of lovers in the beech wood or of the death of the beloved in the quiet chamberrepresented with great truth the picture of the two friends in youth the manly and strong john halifax the wealthy phineas is new in many of its features and not new only but beautiful the general tone of the novel we may show by one quotation john halifax has lost his first and dearest daughter the blind muriel shortly before whose death another daughter had been born and though the author has felt too much the pathos of muriel in her story and dwelled on it too long still for all that it is pathos john went early to the room upstairp it was very still ursula lay calmly asleep with baby maud in her bosom on her other side with yes wide open to the
