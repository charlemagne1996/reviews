B6153	"['9420680', '3157947']"	  between the acts by henry w nevinson ivtuuvu murray the drama of life says mr nevinson is divided into acts and only in the intervals when the actdrop falls do we become conscious of the real significance of what has passed that is certainly true of most men and applying it he remarks that in the majority of autobiographies we are most interested when the writer forgets his own prominence and introduces figures which have  moved upon the distant stage and but for his notice would have been forgotten we are to understand apparently that these sketches represent such retrospect casual episodes and situations which i have observed or imagined  in these entractes of life that  imagined has we think much virtue it is difficult to conceive that most of these sketches are actual experiences unless mr nevinson has been given unusually romantic opportunities in fact apart from the two opening essays for such they may be called these sketches based on observed fact or not take the shape of short tales nowise to be distinguished from the short story in general whatever their origin they are well written and that is all which matters the first two essays are personal reminiscences of childish or boyish scenes the second is a record of schooldays very well done but we prefer the first  a london merchant it is merely a sketch of a grandfathers family prayers and the various members of the household assembled for that rather gloomy function but it is done with an excellent quietness and geniality of humour from the evangelical and tory grandfather tb the housekeeper on whose head fluttered the supersensual essence of a cap they are all types and types of that older world well worth preservation the evangelical grandfather is a delightful personage dexterously remembered for sunday reading he chiefly commends the children to  the family sepulchre he once alarmed the household by reciting a poem of moores but his customary attitude towards such sinful frivolities was stern the family aunts in their youthful years he led to hear joanna baillie recite one of her  plays of the passions yon know or you do not know those  plays of the passions they are perfectly academic passions but midway he arose  my dears this is no fit place for you he pronounced and led the four daughters out in file leaving the licentious poetess to finish her drama as best she might after such a testimony to its seductive power poor academic joanna yet despite his evangelicalism he was a rigid tory because un ancestor was reputed to have rendered some vague service to king charles the martyr you know that old man though you probably never have met him but the remainder of the contents as we have said are veritably short stories they are all psychological studies phases of character not of special originality not what we should call brilliant they are yet skilfully handled with a mastery over the mechanism of the short story and with much delicacy in the analysis of temperament one for instance  a dons day is the study of a university don with an undecided and undecidable vocation for the church it is we think a lit le overemphasized the valetudinarian and incessant diagnosis of his own spiritual state though recognisably possible and in the picture awakens the readers impatience to a degree we scarce think intended the man is an insufferable and weakminded prig who wants shaking that may be the authors verdict  since he ends by making him set off as a foreign missionary but one is not hopeful of his missionary future one doubts whether he has the pluck or unselfishness for the zeal to be lasting his vacillation and selfabsorption are overdrawn in fact another sketch shows a journalist unselfishly spending himself for a girl who accepts his devotion blindly and is in love with a poet we do not recognise that poet he is too brilliant in talk too romantic altogether the poet of commerce is not that way and we would back the journalist against him with the young lady but it is sympathetically done  en revanche a further story presents a poet as the luckless lover outrivalled by a professor who deserts the lady of their common affection they meet her afterwards as a worn and toomarried woman with a sick husband and the other appurtenances of the situation but the thing is worked out with a tenderness which effaces its conventional elements in truth these are very clever sketches possessing both emotional and humorous power at once delicate and restrained they stand well above the usual level even of the wellwritten short story  between the acts by henry wv nezinson gs net murray in this exceedingly interesting miscellany nmr nevinson has embodied much of personal observation and experience the two opening essays give very vivid and pleasant glimpses of the authors earlier years both at home and at school and are written with a charm and a quiet humour that tempt one back to read them through again the stories are wonder fully varied  in twentyfocr hours an episode of the terrible stampede of the greeks in their war against turkey is charged with a tense but reticent pathos and the fearsome panicstricken flight itself is described with such an imaginative realism that it haunts the reader almost as if it were an actual memory of his own other stories are of the boer war of various phases of life abroad of journalistic life at home and one  the last rag is of lower london and will rank with mr nevinsons masterly and never sufficiently recognised neighbours of ours the lyrics interspersed among the stories are touched with a grace and melody of poetic fancy and emotion of the ballads perhaps a ballad of gods mercy is the most powerful and the most finely imaginative this is an arresting and a memorable book written with the sureness of touch the knowledge of life and broad humanity that marks all mr nevinsons best work	englishfiction

yonges publishers exercised a wise discretion in issuing  the pillars of the house  in instalments of a volume at a time the heart of the boldest and most eager novelreader might have quailed before the achievement of mastering the four volumes at once 1220 pages each containing we should say at least half as much again as a page of an ordinary novel the book is in fact hardly so much a novel as an imaginary family history an account during a period of eighteen years of the fortunes of the thirteen sons and daughters of the rev edward underwood and mary his wife the youngest of whom a twin boy and girl are born on the very day of their fathers death for purposes of reference we are favoured with a copy of the first page of the underwood family bible setting forth the christian names in full and the dates of birth of the thirteen heroes and heroines as well as with a rough outline map of the vale leston estate and a ground plan of the house mr underwood had married his distant cousin the niece and adopted daughter of the rector of vale leston with the assurance of ultimately succeeding to the living and meantime acting as curate it was a family living always held conjointly with a tolerably good estate enough to qualify the owner for what miss young considers the dangerous position of squarson but the uncle dying suddenly and with a flaw in his will an undesirable nephew and heiratlaw whom he had desired to exclude stepped in and disliking mr underwoods high church opinions made his own son take orders for the sake of the living edward underwood took a curacy at bexley and as his stipend did not increase and his family did overwork and worry have so told on a not naturally strong constitution that he dies before we have got through the first 100 pages of the book and his wife soon follows him then felix the eldest son a boy of sixteen for the sake of his family renounces all thought of oxford and the church and becomes assistant to mr froggat the bexley bookseller who combines with his business the proprietorship of the pursuivant a local journal and he and wilmet the eldest girl resolve to be pillars of the house and keeps home together for the younger ones it is the history and result of their endeavour that forms the theme of the story we shall not attempt any summary of the book which indeed would be impossible within anything like reasonable limits it will be sufficient to say a few words as to its general character it is prolix  it is sometimes tedious  it is so overcrowded with characters that we get into a maze as to whos who  we are often bored with its nursery and schoolroom moralities and long to escape into a higher and freer atmosphere and yet somehow we are interested in it and carried on to the end as we often fail to be by many books showing far higher mental gifts in their authors miss young is one of those who receive the blessing promised to whosoever is faithful over a few things her range is of the narrowest but within it she shows herself thoroughly the artist nearly all her characters herecertainly all the thirteen underwoods have a distinct life and individuality of their own though author hardly tells us a word about them but shows them to us as they are and makes us watch them through a growth and development which poor and stunted as it must be deemed by all whose minds are not cramped by the shackles of her prim anglicanism we yet feel is true and consistent naturally she succeeds better with her women than her menor rather wo should say with her girls than her boys for whatever be the time of life  assigned to them her leading dramatis jvrsona always bear distinctly the stamp of nonage the austerity and excessive prudence and carefulness developed in wilmet through her youthful responsibilities when she has to think hard how to make the most of every halfpenny in the shilling a devotion to the commonplace strangely at variance with her faultlessly beautiful faceis excellently and most amusingly sketched indeed the beautiful face i9 to the practical wilmet  w w as her brothers cali her from her two names wilmet ursula rather an annoying superfluity im sure she says i should be glad enough not to be pretty but it is a trial and one must do the best one can even greater skill is shown in the picture of the lame girl geraldine or cherry who is to us the most interesting of the group and with her genius her passion for art and beauty and her bright wit reminds usa long way off it is truebut still does remind us of the charming eugenie de la ferronnaye though miss young is quite without any deep humour she has a great appreciation of liveliness and wellbred fun andwe have laughed heartily over many of her scenes her pathetic passages too have often great tenderness and beauty though she is here on dangerous ground for she has a hankering after melancholy details and mere sentimentalism which continually threatens to lead her astray wre have wished sometimes that miss young could at a sufficiently early age have been brought under the influence of wider and freer modes of thinking and viewing things than that prevalent in the refined and scholarly but intensely narrow clerical circles whose spirit she reproduces so faithfully she might so have been led to apply her powers of realistic painting which in a certain way are really great to the production of something higher and worthier than pictures of the rather small lives of some halffledged boys and girls more or less good or  naughty yet probably for her readers at any rate it is better as it is she would have been puzzled and overwhelmed if told to see life with her own eyes and finds ecclesiastical leadingstrings a support more than a restraint we doubt if she would have ever done really better work than she does now in the field that has become natural to her a field hedged in by the proprieties and respectabilities with the creeds and the church catechism accepted on all hands as the dernier mot of speculation and morality thence she can look out on the waste lands of schism that lie beyond and on those gloomier regions in the far distance the  antres

B8017	['8538348']	  novels the dukes cahihren by anthony trollope chapman and hall limited london in his last novel mr trollope pursues his old plan of bringing many of the familiar and absurdlynamed characters of former works again on to the scene a few die and fresh ones immediately take their place but the haunts they frequent the society they mingle in and the manners they adopt show but little variation the dukes children  of course keeps the reader almost exclusively in those upper circles which mr trollope describes and loves so well we are introduced immediately after the poor duchess of omnium has died and we find the poor duke plunged in grief not only is he heartbroken at the loss of his wife but he is dismayed at the prospect of having to look after his daughter lady mary palliser aged nineteen he takes counsel of mrs phineas finn his late wifes most intimate friend and she advises that a companion should be found for lady mary the duke proposes that mrs finn should be the companion for the time being at any rate but to this plan the latter is strongly disinclined because she suspects that lady mary has formed an attachment for a gentleman whom the duke would certainly not approve of asa husband forhis daughter hersuspicions turn out to have been well founded lady mary confesses to her that she loves mr francis tregear the gentlem3n in question who will only have fifteen hundred a year when his mother dies when mrs finn learns this she tells lady mary that she mrs finn must inform the duke at once unless mr tregear will save her the trouble then with lady marys consent she determines to see mr tregear and talk to him on the subject we may say at once that mr tregear has no disqualification for being the soninlaw even of the duke of omnium except that he is poornd has no title he is a gentleman highly educated extremely handsome and the intimate friend of lord silverbridge the dukes eldest son even the duchess had smiled on his suit but now she is dead and gone so mrs finn goes to see tregear they have a long conversation the end of which is that tregear against his will is persuaded into promising that he will tell the duke of his love for lady mary within a week and he fulfils his promise he enters the dukes studio one evening  looking beautiful as apollo as he stood upright before his wishedfor fatherinlaw the duke however is not sufficiently overcome by his appearance to entertain his proposal for one instant when he has got over his surprise at tregeares astounding audacity he simply replies  of course it is impossible you are not so ignorant but that you must have known as much when you came to me but tregear will not admit that it is impossible and they proceed to argue the matter out the dukes non possurnus prevails in the end however and tregear after having let out that ms finn was aware of the young peoples attachment is dismissed with a curt  good morning sir a form of adieu which testifies to the dukes confusion of mind it being at the time 6 pm the duke soon afterwards sees his daughter and tells her also that it is impossible but she is just as difficult to convince as tregear she will not even promise not to write to tregear though she declares that should she feel obliged to do so she will tell her father what she has written the duke is discomfited but he determines to hand lady mary over to some stern female friend who would aid him in preventing the contemplated ilsaliance while these events are occurring the reader is taken with lord silverbridge to the beargarden club and there made acquainted with several other scions of the nobility as well as major ti to a sporting associate of the dukes son then a little later on we make the acquaintance of lady mabel grex a rather basese young beauty the daughter of earl grex a shabby genteel and somewhat scandalous old nobleman it is soon apparent that lord silverbridge is half inclined to fall in love with lady mabel presently the reader is permitted to see that lady mabel is in love with frank tregear although she will not own to it the truth is they had very nearly been engaged once and would have been quite if lady mabel had not seen that for two paupers as she described frank and herself to think of marrying would be absurd and now frank tregear has fallen in love with somebody else and though it was her own doing lady mabel cannot but feel wounded that her lover should take her so readily at her word and now she is resolved to have lord silverbridge who seems nothing loth yet on one occasion when he almost proposes to her she almost tells him she will not have him but she feels sure that he will not be content with this answer and when he next asks her she will accept him but she has not reckoned on the appearance of a certain miss isabel boncassen a very beautiful american heiress who with her father and mother now comes on the scene lord silverbridge is at once captured by the new belle and of course as the duke is horrified at the thought of his eldest son marrying an american whose materr al parent says 11oh laws  and the like further complications at once ensue additional interest is given to the development of the plot by the introduction of various subsidiary episodes there are some election scenes occasioned by lord silverbridge going into parliament sporting readers will be interested in the chapters devoted to horseracing and the manner in which lord silverbridge is sold by his friend major tifto but the main purpose of the story is to show how the duke of omniums children fell in love with people of inferior station to themselves how their father quarrelled with them for so doing and how in the end the noble family were reconciled mr trollope tells this story with fluency but whether after all it is worth the telling is another matter mr trollopes great fault as apparent as ever in his last work is the superficiality of his characters it is impossible to feel any real interest in their fortunes or in the storms in teacups which the authoreis perpetually rousing frank tregear shows only one conspicuous quality from first to last and that is his determination to marry lady mary the converse of this may be said with equal truth of the dukes daughter no reader will have any doubt regarding the ultimate end of the lovers difficulties which end by the way is exceedingly tame when it does come the story of the dukes injustice to mrs finn fills several pages and is told with great circumlocution but not a particle of interest attaches to the imbroglio the only person in the book for whom any real sympathy can be felt is lady mabel grex with all her faults she is womanly and has to endure real suffering tregears treatment of her is as cruel as it is unnatural  i i i moreover it seems to us as much a mistake to wake lady mabel so far forget herself as to actually ask lord silverbridge to marry her as to afterwards allow her to tell him that she never loved him yet despite these blemishes in her character the sympathies of most readers will be with lady mabel especially as she is the only person in the book who is left

among the cottagers in scotland the present volumes consist of twentyfour tales of infinite variety including home adventures deeds of heroism military exploits an affecting tale of seduction country dreams and superstitions c c relating to various periods and some of them not very remote whether they all have for their foundation some traditionary tales related among the peasants or not we cannot determine but certain wear that they are indebted for their present garb to the author of the  queens wake whose simplicity of style and vigonr of description are strikingly evident the work has reached us too late in the week to allow a detailed criticism on its merit and this we suspect our readers would dispense with to get to the work itself we therefore select one tale entire and shall return to the subject next week the tale is entitled the long pack in the year 1723 colonel ridley returned from india with what in those clays was accounted an immense fortune and retired to a country seat on the banks of north tyne in northumberland the house was rebuilt and furnished with every thing elegant and costly andamongst others a service ot plate supposed to be worth 10001 he went to london annual y with his family during a few of the winter months if 4i thesetllnes there were but few left at his country house at the tune we treat of there were only three domestics remained there a maid servant whose name was alice kept ine house and there were besides an old man and a boy the fcrvk   e orn and the other took care of some cattle wtne two ploughmen were boarded in houses of their own n9r5  i 00n asaice was sitting spinning some yarn for a smirni5 kings j hersef a pedar entered the hau with a sepack t hs back aice had seen as long a pack and snedeiri30  but a pa equally long broad and thick ter whl st never saw h was abot the middle of win wearsomp 4ays wfre short and the ni8hts cold long and and very l j  pedar was a handsome welldressed man maid as ansy avery asreeable companion for such a that from t onsnch a night as that yet alice declared he ntrodnvvvy sh d not hke him greatly and though of ss sh iuke ribadrand a reat deal ne hem wk yet when he came to ask a nights lodgject said hi hlr perelmptor refusal  he jested on the su6ybefrredtewm in the  for that it would auttu creaturealice was an old maid and any vine but beautifulhe then took her on his knee caressed and kissed her but all would not do no she would not consent to his staying there  but are you really going to put me away to night   yes  indeed mv dear girl you must not be so unreasonable i am come straight from newcastle where i have been purchasing a fresh stock of goods which are so heavy that 1 cannot travel far with them and as the people around are all of the poorer sort i will rather make you a present of the finest shawl in my pack before i go further at the mentioning of the shawl the picture of deliberation was portrayed in lively colours on alices face for a little  but her prudence overcame no she was but a servant and had orders to harbour no person about the house but such as came on business nor these either unless she wes well acquainted with them  what the worse can you or your master or any one else be of suffering me to tarry until the morning  i entreat you do not insist for here you cannot be but indeed i am not able to carry my goods further tonight  then you must leave them or get a horse to carry them away  of all the sweet inflexible beings that ever were made you certainly are the chief but i cannot blame you your resolution is just and right well well since no better may be i must leave them and go search for lodgings myself somewhere else for fatigued as i am it is as much 3s my life is worth to endeavour carrying them further alice was rather taken at her word  she wanted nothing to do with his goeds the man was displeased at her and might accuse her of stealing some of them  but it was an alternative she had proposed and against which she could start no plausible objection  so she consented though with much reluctance  but the pack will be better out of your way said hef and safer if you will be so kind as lock it by in some room or closet she then led him into a low parlour where he placed it carefully on two chairs and went his way wishing alice a good night  when old alice and the pack were left together in the large house by themselves she felt a kind of undefined terror come over her mind about it  what can be in it said she to herself that makes it so heavy surely when the man carried it this length he might have carried it farther tooit is a confoundedly queer pack  ill go and look at it ance again and see what 1 think is in it and suppose i should handle it all round i may then perhaps have a good guess what is in it  alice went cautiously and fearfully into the parlour and opened a wallpressshe wanted nothing in the press indeed she never looked into it for her eyes were fixed on the pack and the longer she looked at it she liked it the worse and as to handling it she would not have touched it for all that it contained she came again into the kitchen and conversed with herself she thought of the mans earnestness to leave it of its monstrous shape and every circumstance connected with itthey were all mysterious and she was convinced iq her own mind that there was something uncanny if not un earthly in the pack 1 what surmises will not fear give rise to in the mind of a woman she lighted a moulded candle and went again toto the parlour closed the window shutters and barred them before she came out she set herself upright held in her breath and took another steady and scrutinising look of the padu cod of mercy  she saw it moving as visibly as she ever saw any thing in her life every hair on her head stood upright every inch of flesh on her body crept like a nest of pismires siie hasted into the kitchen as mst as she could for her knees bent under the terror that had overwhelmed the heart of poor alice she puffed out the candle lighted it again and not being able to find a candlestick though a dozen stood on the shelf in the fore kitchen she set it in a waterjui and ran out tothe barn for old richard  oh richard oh for mercy richard make haste and come into the house come away richard why what is the matter alice  what is wrong  oh richard  a pedlar came into the hall entreating for lodging well i would not let him stay on any account and behold he is gone off and left his pack  and what is the great matter in that  said richard  i will wager a penny he will look after it before it shall look after him  but oh richard i tremble to tell you  we are all gone for it is i living pack a living pack said richard staring at alice and letting his chops fall down richard had just lifted his flail over his head to begin threshing a sheaf but when he heard of a living pack he dropped ene end of the handstaff to the floor and leaning on the other took such a look at alice isle knew long before that alice was beautiful lie knew that ten years before but he never took such a look at her in his life a living pack  said richard  why the woman is mad without all doubt  oh richard  come away heaven knows what is in it but 1 saw it moving as plainly as i see you at present make haste and come away richard richard did not stand to expostulate any longer nor even to put on his coat but followed alice into the house assuring lier by the way that it was nothing but a whim and of a piece with many of her phantasies  but added he of all the foolish ideas that ever possessed your brain this is the most unfeasible unnatural and impossible how can a pack made up of napkins and muslins and corduroy breeches perhaps ever become alive it is even worse than to suppose a horses hair will turn an eel so saying he lifted the candle out of the jug and turning about never stopped till he had ins hand upon the pack isle felt the deals that surrounded its edges to prevent the goods being rumpled and spoiled by carrying the cords that bound it and the canvas in which it was wrapped  the pack was well enough he found nought about it than other packs wanted it was jiibt like other packs made up of the same stuff isle saw nought that ailed it and a good large pack it was lt would cost the honest man 2001 if not more it would cost him 3001 or 3501 if the goods were fine but he would make it all up again by cheating fools like alice with his gewgaws alice testified some little disappointment at seeing richard unconvinced even by occular proof she wished she had never seen him or it howsomever for she was convinced there was something mysterious about it  that they were stolen goods or something that way and she was terrified to stay in the house with it but richard assured her the pack was a right enough pack  during this conversation in comes edward isle was a lad about sixteen years of age son to a coaldriver on the borderwas possessed of a good deal of humour and ingenuity but somewhat roguish forward and commonly very ragged in his apparel isle was about this time wholly intent on shooting the crows and birds of various kinds that alighted in whole docks where he foddered the cattle isle had bought a huge old military gun which he denominated copenhagen and was continually thundering away at them isle seldom killed by if ever but he once or twice knocked off a few feathers jm after much narrow inspection discovered some drops of wo6d on the snow he was at this very moment come in a great hste for copenhagen having seen a glorious chance of rrows and a robinred breast among them feeding on the of alcorn rick but hearing them talk of something mysterious aa a living pack he pricked up his eats and was ali attention m faith alice said he  if you will let me ill hoot it  hold your peace you foolsaid richard ed v t j s r t e tt r d e v 9 s lt d e if it e x e e s ward took thc candle from richard who still held it in hihand and gliding down the passage edged up the parlour door and watched the pack attentively for about two minutes he then came back with a spring and with looks yerv different from those which regulated his features as he went down as sure as lie had death to meet with he saw it stirring hold your peace you fool said richard edward swore aaia that he saw it stirring but whether he really thought so or only said so is hard to determine  faith alice said he again  if you will let me ph shoot it  i tell you to hold your peace you fool said richard no said edward  in the multitude of counsellors there is safety  and i will maintain this to be our safest plan our masters house is con signed to our care and the wealth that it contains may tempt some people to use stratagems now if we open up this mans pack he may pursue us for damages to any amount but if i shoot it what amends can he get of me if there is anv thing that should not be there lord how i will pepper it and if it is lawful goods lie can only make me pay for the few that are damaged which 1 will git at valuation so if none of you will acquiesce i will lake all the blame upon myself and ware a shot upon it richard said whatever was the consequence he would be blameless a half delirious smile rather distorted than beautified alices pretty face but edward took it for an assent for he had been advancing so snatching up copenhagen in one hand and the candle in the other he hasted down the passage and without hesitating one moment fired at the pack gracious heaven the blood gushed out upon the floor like a torrent and a hideous roar followed by the groans of death issued from the pack edward dropped copenhagen upon the ground and ran into the kitchen like one distracted the kitchen was darkish for he had left the candle in the parlour so taking to the door without being able to utter a word he ran to thc hills like a wild roe looking over each shoulder as fast as he could turn his head from the one side to the ether alice followed as fast as she could but lost half the way of edward she was all the way sighing and crying most pitifully cid richard stood for a short space rather in a state of petrefaataon but at length after some hasty ejaculations lie went into the parlour the whole iloor rio wed with blood lise pack had thrown itself on the ground but the groans and cries were ceased and only a kind of guttural noise was heard from ii knowing that then something must be dene ha ran after his companions and called on them to rome back though edward had escaped a good way and was tiil persevering on yet as he never took long time to conquer oi the utility of any thing but acted from immediate impulse he turned and came as fast back as he had gone away alice also came homeward but more slowly and crying even more bitterly than before edward overtook her and was holding on his course but as he passed she turned away her face and called him a murderer at the sound of this epithet edward made a dead pause and looked at alice with a face much longer than it used to be isle drew in his breath twice as if going to speak but he only swallowed a great mouthful of air and held his peace  they were soon all three in the parlour and in no little terror and agitation of mind unloosed the pack the principe commodity of which was a stout young man whom edward had shot through the heart and tui bereaved of existence ia a few minutes to paint the feelings or even the appearance of young edward during this scene is impossible he acta little spoke less and appeared in a hopeless stupor the mos of his employment consisted in gulping down mouthful  breath wiping his eyes and staring at his associates 4 it is most generally believed that when edward tiiea a the pack he had not the most distant idea of shooting a ua but seeing alice so jealous of it he thought the colonel w0ujj see how many folds of the pedlars fine haberdashery ware voy hagen would drive the drops through so that when the stream of blood burst from the pack accompanied with the dying groans of a human being edward was certainly taken by surprise and quite confounded  he indeed asserted as long as northeast lived that he saw something stirring in the pack but his eagerness to shoot and his terror on seeing what he had done which was no more than what he might have expected had he been certain he saws the pack moving makes this asseveration very doubtful they made all possible speed in extricating the corpse intending to call medical assistance but it was too late the vital spark was gone for ever  alas said old richard heaving a deep sigh  poor man tis all over with him  i wish he had lived a little longer to have repented of this for he has surely died in a bad cause poor man  he was somebodys son and no doubt dear to them and nobody can tell how small a crime this hath by a regular gradation become the fruits of richard came twice across his eye with the sleeve of his shirt for he still wanted the coat a thought of a tender nature shot through his heart t alas if his parents are alive how will their hearts bear this poorcreatures said richard weeping outright  poor creatures  god pity them   the way he was packed up was artful and curious his knees were brought up towards his breast and his feet and jegs were stuffed in a wooden box  another wooden box a size larger and wanting the bottom made up by the vacancy betwixt his face and knees and there being only one fold of canvas around this he breathed with the greatest freedom  but it had undoubtedly been the heaving of his breast which had caused the movement noticed by the servants his right arm was within the box and to his hand was tied a cutlass with which he could rip himself from his confinement at once there were also four loaded pistols secreted with him and a silver windcall on coming to the pistols and cutlass  villain said oid richard  see what he has here but i should not call him villain said he again softening his tone  for he is now gone to answer at that bar where no false witness nor loquacious orator can bias the justice of the sentence pronounced on him he is now in the true world and i am in the false one we can judge only from appearances but thanks be to our kind maker and preserver that he was discovered else it is probable that none of us should have again seen the light of day these moral reflections from the mouth ot old richard by degrees raised the spirits of edward  he was bewildered in uncertainty and had undoubtedly given himself up for lost but he now began to discover that he had jone a meritorious and manful action and for the first time since he had fired the fatal shot ventured to speak  faith it was lucky that i shot then said edward  but neither of his companion answered either good or bad alice though rather grown desperate behaved and assisted at this bloody affair better than might have been expected edward surveyed the pistols all round two of which were of curious workmanship  biit what do you think he was going to do with all these said edward  i think you need not ask that richard answered  faith it was a mercy that i shot after 11said edward  for if we had loosed him out we should have been all dead in a minute i have given him a devil of 3 broadside though but look ve richard providence has greeted me to the right spot for i might as readily have wdged the contents of copenhagen in one of these empty boxes  it has been a deep laid scheme said richard  to murder us and rob our masters house  there must certainly be moro concerned in it than these two ideas beget ideas often quite different and then others again in unspeakable gradation which run through and shift tn the mind with as much velocity as the streamers around the pole in a frosty night on richards mentioning more concerned edward instantaneously thought of a gang of thieves th m8hthow he would break the leg of oneshoot another through the headand scatter them like chaff before the wind e would rather shoot one robber on his feet or on horseback n ten lying tied up in packs and then what a glorious prey 1 of pistols he would get from the dead rascalsbow be would 1 prime and load and tyre away with perfect safety from within  how alice would scream and richard would ar and all would goon with the noise and rapidity of a windmill and he would acquire everlasting fame so high was the young and ardent mind of edward wrought up by his train of ideas that he was striding up and down the floor while his eyes gleamed as with a tint of madness  oh if i had but plenty of guns and nothing ado but to shoot how i would pepper the dogs  said he with great vehemence to the no small astonishment of his two associates who thought him gone mad  what can the fool mean said old richard  what can he ail at the dogs  i oh it is the robbers that i mean said edward  what robbers you young fool  said richard  why do not you think the pedlar will come back at the dead of the night to the assistance of his friend and bring plenty of help with him too said edward  there is not a doubt of it said old richard  there is not a doubt of it said alice and both stood up stiff with fear and astonishment  oh merciful heaven  what is to become of us  said alice again  what are we to do u let us trust ia the lord said old richard  i intend in the first place to trust in old copenhagen said edward putting down the i frizzel and making it spring up again with a loud snap five tr j six times  but good lord  what are we thinking about  vu run and gather in all the guns in the country the impulse of the moment was edwards monitor off he ran like fire and warned a few of the colonels retainers who he knew kept guns about them these again warned others and at eight oclock they had twentyfive men in the house and sixteen loaded pieces including copenhagen and the four pistols found on the deceased these were distributed amongst the front windows in the upper stories and the rest armed with pitchforks old swords and cudgels kept watch below edward had taken care to place himself with a comrade at a window immediately facing the approach to the house and now backed as he was by such a strong party grew quite impatient for another chance with his redoubted copenhagen all however remained quiet until an hour past midnight when it entered into his teeming brain to blow the thief s silver windcall so without warning any of the rest be set his head out at the window and blew until all the hills and woods around yelled their echoes this alarmed the guards as not j knowing the meaning of it but how were they astonished at hearing it answered by another at no great distance the state of anxiety into which this sudden and unforeseen circumstance threw our armed peasants is more easily conceived than described the fate of the masters great wealth and even their own fates was soon to be decided and none but be who surveys and overrules futurity could tell what was to be the issue every breast heaved quicker every breath was cut short every gun was cocked and pointed to the courtgate every orb of vision was strained to discover the approaching foe by the dim light of the starry canopy and every ear expanded to catch the distant sounds as they floated on the slow frosty breeze  ihe suspense was not of long continuance in less than five minutes the trampling of horses was heard which increased as they approached to the noise of thunder and in due course a body of men ou horseback according to the account given by the colonels people exceeding their own nurobe  came up at a brisk trot and ben to enter the courtgate edward unable to restrain himself any longer tired copenhagen in their faces one of the foremost dropped ana his horse made a spring towards the hall door this discharge was rather premature as the wall still shielded a part of the gang from the windows it was howerer the watchword to all the rest and in the course of two seconds the whole sixteen guns were all discharged at them before the smoke dispersed they were all fled no doubt greatly amazed at the reception which they met with edward and bis comrade nu down stairs to see how matters stood for it was their opinion that they had shot them erery ont and that their hones had taken fright at the noise and gallopped off without them  but the club below warmly protested against their opening any of the doors till day so they were obliged to betake themselves agaitt to their birth up stairs  thoujjjh our peasants had gathered up a little courage and confidence in themselves their situation was curious and to them a dreadful one they saw and heard a part of their fellow creatures moaning and expiring in agonies in the open air which was intensely cold yet durst not go to administer the least relief for fear of a surprise an hour or two after this great brush edward and his messmate descended again and becked hard for leave to go and reconnoitre for a few minutes which after some disputes was granted they found only four men fallen who appeared ali to be quite dead one of them was lying within the porch  faith said edward  heres the chap that i shot the other three were without at a considerable distance from each other they durst not follow their tract further as the road entered betwixt groves of trees but retreated into their post without touching any thing  about an hour before day some of them were alarmed at hearing the sound of horses feet a second time which however was only indistinct and heard at considerable intervals and nothing of them ever appeared not long after this edward and his friend were almost frightened out of their wits at seeing as they thought the dead man within the gate endeavouring to get up and escape they had seen him dead lying surrounded by a deluge of congealed blood and nothing but the idea of ghosts and hobgoblins entered their brains they were so indiscreet as never to think of firing but ran and told the tale of horror to some of their neighbours the sky was by this time grown so dark that nothing could be seen with precision and they ali remained in anxious incertitude until the opening day discovered to tbem by degrees that the corpses were removed and nothing left but large sheets of frozen blood and the mornings alarms hythe ghost and the noise of horses had been occasioned by some of the friends of the men that had fallen conveying them away for fear of a discovery  next morning the news flew like fire and the three servants were much incommoded by crowds of idle ami officious people that gathered about the house some inquiring after the smallest particulars some begging to see the body that lay in the parlour and others pleased themselves with poring over the sheets of crimson ice and tracing the drops of blood on the road down the wood the colonel had no country factor nor any particular friend in the neighbourhood so the affair vas not pursued with that speed which was requisite to the discovery of the accomplices which if it had would have been productive of some very unpleasant circumstances by involving sundry respectable families as it afterwards appeared but too evidently dr herbert the physician who attended hie family occasionally wrote to the colonel by post conen hing the affair but though he lost no time it was the fifth day efore he arrived then indeed advertisements were i ut and posted up in all public places offering rewards for a discovery of anv person killed or wounded of late all the dead and sick within twenty miles were inspected by medical men and a most extensive search made but to no purpose lt was too late  all was secured some indeed were missing but plausible pretences being made for their absence nothing could be done but certain it is sundry of these were never seen any more in the country though many of the neighbourhood declared they were such people as nobody could suspect  1 lie body of the unfortunate man who w as shot in the pack jay open lo inspection a fortnight but none would ever acknowledge so much as having seen him the colonel then au ed him to be buried at bellingham but it was confident reported that his grave was opened and his corpse takei away jn short not one engaged in this base and bold attem t was ever discovered a constant watch was kept by fgiit for some time thc colonel rewarded the defenders o his house liberally old richard remained in the family during the rest of his life and had a good salary for only saving prayers amongst the servants every night alice was manied to a tobacconist at hexham edward was made the colonels gamekeeper and had a present ofafinegold mounted gun given him his master afterwards procured him a commission in a regiment of foot where he suffered many misfortunes and disappointments he was shot through the shoulder at the battle of fontenoy but recovered and retiring on half pay took a small farm on the scottish side his character was that of a brave but rash officer kind generous and openhearted in all situations i have often stood at his knee and listened with wonder and amazement to his stories of battles and sieges but none of them ever pleaded me better than that of the long pack  alas  his fate is fast approaching to us all he hath mainyears ago submitted to the conqueror of all mankind his brave heart is now a clod of the valley and his grey hairs recline in peace on that pillow from which his head shall be raised only when time shall be no more to be continued  jvinter evening tales sc rv james hor concluded from p 270 i on returning to the winter evening tales we find that  manx of them are very stale and we believe as well i known anion the cottagers in the south of fngluud as j in the south of scotland where mr hogg professes to  have collected them we hi vc already said that they are indebted to the author lor their present dress and while we admire thc spirited manner in winch many olthem are  narrated we are sorry to observe the frequency and oue i nos of though oaths with which he has interlarded them j air hogg ought to know that  to swear is neither jelite j genteel nor brave1 and that while he indulges p riinps j ins own propensity and gratifies a few persons who may j think that an oath givc a zest to an expression he shocks ill the better part of snriety and renders that disgusting j with which they mi ht otherwise have been dchedile i j we may also remark that there is often an extravagance  of language that is iiite unnatural in the tale enti i tied 4 wt ildean hall1 tiie fears of andrew drive him to a  stammering which is truly ridiculous j wc shall only makvj two extracts from the econd j volume of this work  the first is a singular epistle from a  subject to his sovereign and for the antin ntcite of which i air hogg pledges himself   the following is a copy of a letter written nv ard ie io a  greit personage dated aberlosk may i7ih isoo j  4i to gtrlre the third london    1 ktt sini went thirty miles on foot yesterday io j nay your

returned in ni e course of pot  but tiie truth is  an  for the jokes ake t is a great pity it should have been so that the singularity of the address caused onie friend to ocn the letter and re  tarn it with the iiuney to the owner but not bettie tiny hiul taken a copy of it from winch the abve is exactly transcribed we shall conclude with the last tale of the volume which appears to us the best

B4754	['5781119']	  the history of matthew wald i i e i f is no feature in which the novels of our age liffer more from those of the last than in the speculative and ideal cast which they have assuned the bustling plots crowded with incidentsthe characters leveloping themselves only in action the brief and meagre descriptions the system which considered subjert as every thing and execution a matter of comparative insignificance have been supplanted by more intellectual and we cannot help thinking more interesting views plots have become simple even to poverty the province of action has been narrowed to extend that of thought feeling has become the mainspring of interest and its analyses and expression the test of talent descriptions of external nature have become more graphical and mi nnte and their connexion with the business of the taleas influencing by their secret but sensible power the feelings of the agentsis better understood and rendered more effective and available the first of these systems certainly indicates a want of refined feeling in the public it was altogether of a meaner and more mechanical castit addressed itself to a lower class of feelings and might have been acted on by minds of no deep feeling and even of scanty invention for though the process of creating an original story is one of no trifling effort the task of combination or disjunction is not a difficult one and a very slight acquaintance with the history of fiction enables us to see how frequently the composition of these novels of incident has been a work of alteration rather than invention they had one advantage however in the very mediocrity of the principle on which they were constructed they were seldom tiresome if the reader perused them with little of that deep thrillin interest which he now feels we have no doubt he yawned less also if he wept lessbe laughed more there were fewer chances of failure for the effect of a sequence of ludicrous or striking incidents admitted of little variation and in the hands of an author of the greatest or the most slender talent produced only a pleasure differing a little in degree but the more ambitious system of modern novelists while it renders the power of genius more visible and vindicates more certainly its lreeminence over mediocrity makes the works of the lesser herd utterly wretched and intolerable destitute of those hum bler attractions of plot and incident which they might have attained andl filled with ludicrous and impotent straining after those more magnificent qualities which it is hopeless for them to emulate or aspire to the present work has nothing to do however with these it belongs to the higher class and if we wished to prove the superiority of that principle of effect on which our modern tales are constructed we know not where we should find a better example wdith a plot of a grosslydefective kindwith few incidentsfew characters of importance and one the most interesting of these appearing only and disappearing as in a dreamwith little aid from humour and less from the mere paint ing of external nature in short by the mere force and grandeur of individual scenes and the general eloquence and beauty of the writing this tale creates and maintains the deepest and most vivid interest and we close it at last with those feelings of dreariness and desolation with which we peruse the remorse of caleb williams or the settled gloom of st leon after his final parting with his son often in the course of the story we feel the unsatisfactory na ture of some of the incidentsthe want of connectionof explanation theunreasonablesupinenessof some of the characters at one time and their fiery and needless impatience at others with a multitude of et cetera but still we are hurried along by the impetuosity of the narrative and it is only when we have fairly finished that we have time to think of all the authors offences against consistency and to wonder how with so many faults obvious to every one we should have so yielded to its influence but the truth is aw this only shews how little sucl things 4 d weigh in the balance of excellence and how easily the atoning power of genius can efface such errors the author is evidently a man of great talent his humour to be sure we do not much like but his pathos his scenes of passion and his eloquence are of the highest kind his conception of character we estimate more highly from his reginald dale tonne than from the present work yet even here there is a wonderful effect about his sketches his females we have always thought particularly captivating athanasia was very good andl helen hesketh admirable of the heroine of this tale we see almost nothingsbe is remorselessly married in the beginning and passes only once before our eyes until the conclusionand yet even this unsubstantial pageant has something about it that lingers in our memory another beautiful and quiet female is opposed to her gentle affectionate and tinged with religious melan choly and her character is touched with the same chaste and powerful pencil wald himself we cannot help thinking disagreeable and none of the subordinate agents of the story are particularly interesting but we suppose the reader would rather form his own opinion and though it is difficult to select any pasage that can give a proper idea of the characteristic vigour of the book we shall extract a few of the shortest accompanying them only by such a notice as to render them intelligible the story is related like those of godwin in the first person an arrangement well suited to such tales as depend for their effect on the expose of feeling and particularly to those where the narrator poees no extraordinary qualities euther of evil or good and may therefore detail bin feeings without any great violation of modesty on the one hand or of wba bility on the other matthew wald is te descendant of a family et norman extraction which

fixed my eyes on the opposite wallthe side of the room along which she was wot to pass i was fixedi was a statue and yet i trembled to the bone to think that perhaps the skirt of her gar ment might be

upon laseelynes face he dis mounted and i could not but hear what he said to his groom  tell them said he  that your lady will require the car riage immediately after breakfast in the morning mty horses at the same time for we have a longish sttage tomorrow  yes my lord said the man and i saw the one enter the house and the other take the way towards the stables i prowled about the woods a while and then denned myself in my garret and i need scarcely say that i did not honour the distinguished company with my presence at their breakfasttable next morning but how acute was my ear how distinctly did i hear the carriage steps slap and the wheels begin to roll the death of sir claud breaks up the party wald commences sur geon in the county town in the neigh bourhood and joanne retires to the residence of that old servant who had related her story to matthew wald the following is the picture of their retirement and of one of the visits of wald i deferred this visit therefore till the last evening of my stay when i easily found my way to a lonely and as lovely a retreat certainly as ever sheltered the infirmities of age or the sorrows of youth fast by the green margin of the noble ora and embowered among the fading foliage of his birches stood the little rustic shieling for which that gentle child of misfortune had left the hall of her fa therm the hill rose precipitous behind clothed to the loftiest crag with copses wood from the midst of which here and there the red gigantic trunks of the native pine towered upwards waith their broad sable canopies the wide stream rolling in heavy murmurs close under neath the branches of the trees its dark brown waters gleaming with the gold of the sunset appeared to cut off the wilders ness it embellished from every intrusion of the world asmllu skiff lay chained to the bankand slowly did i urge it with my single strength against the deep and steady flow of the autumnal river from without the appearance of the cottage itself was rude and even desolate but within the habits of another life had already in the course of but a few days begun their triumph i had to stoop ere i could pass the threshold and i trod upon a floor of naked earth but the exquisite cleanliness that had entered with the new inhabitants had of itself robbed poverty of all its meoness every thing upon the walls shone bright in the blaze of the nicelytrimmed wood fire and mammy sat in her elbowchair at the side of it a perfect specimen of the nmajestic repose of extreme but unbend ing age it seemed to me that there was something far more grand about the whole appearance of the old woman now that i saw her under her own paternal roof the bluntness of address and expression which had before been a sort of oddity to amuse a circle of tolerant superiors was now the natural privilege of indepen dence though indeed i am not sure that the sense of home and the instinct of hospitality had not somewhat softened already the external manifestations of a temper which no change of circumstan ces could have essentially altered i was received with courtesyeven with grace and when a minute or two afterwards miss joanne came into the room and modestly saluting me drew her stool towards m1ammys knee i really could not help thinking that in spite of all the young ladys native elegance of aspect and carriage a stranger might easily have been deceived and supposed himself to be contemplating a family group i you will have no great difficulty in believing could not contemplate it with out some feelings of awkwardness as well as of admiration the situation in which i saw joanne bar was new and her demeanour i could not help thinking was almost as greatly changed we had been used to treat each other like friends some spell seemed now to hover over us both our eyes seldom met and neither addressed more than a few syllables to the othershe took her work and i sat listening or pretending to listen to mammy at last i contrived to make it be understood that i had come to take my farewell that i was to leave the country the next morning mammy gave me her blessing very affectionately and i bowed to joanne the poor girl said nothing but in a very low whisper it was  i wish you well sir wherever you go she did not put out her hand and i retired stammering more good byes i jumped into my little boat and had pushed myself a few yards from the brink when i heard my name called in joannes sweet voice and perceived that she had followed me to the bank of the river and was holding something towards me in her hand i ran theskifin again and shc tooped to give me my gloves which i had le behind me our hands touch ed each otherand in the deepening twilight and in the midst of some con fusion of my own i could not be blind to the blush the deep grave timid blush and the troubled workings of that half averted eye how much may pass in a moment my little boat was out in the stream again almost instantly and yet the words return and hope had been whispered and while in rowing acros the river my eyes were fixed upon the lowly cabin i perceived that a shadow was still lingering in the windowand a soft dream floated over my heart that some day i should indeed return and that the world after all might still re tain some visions of hopeay of tender ness and soothing consolation for me even for me no fiery pulse beatno maddening ecstasy or passion fluttered in my brain these were strings which had been snapt but a calm pensive feeling was deep upon me i cannot explain it no man loves twice perhaps in the same sense of the word but although the pinetree will never sprout again after he has been levelled to the ground what need hinder plants of humbler statute yet of softer foliage to spring from the soil beneath which his ponderous roots are mouldering joanne and wald are marriedand great changes follow wald re covers evidence that the connexion between sir claud and the mother of joanne had been such as would according to the law of scotland amount to a regular marriage and that his wife was consequently the heiress of his estatesand the fa mily of sir claud are glad to com promise the matter by ceding to him the property of barrmains his hap piness is qualified however by a strong metlodistical feeling to which the gentle mind of joanne had been for some time yielding and to di vert her

over a good deal of a comic cast which is fairly executed but exceedingly inferior to the deeper parts of the book to which we now approach with rapidity wald receives the unexpected intelligence that katharine had been deserted by her husband and had disappeared and by one of those strange accidents which never occur anywhere but in novels and not in the best of thee either the lodginghouse of

B5860	"['6797323', '8842702', '3163024', '3451157', '6766105']"	  evelyn innes by george moore fisher unwin we have an immense respect for mr george moore as a novelist tris patience his laboriousness his remarkable fidelity to the artistic light that is in him are rare and invaluable qualities in an age of facile production and ready compromise starting we should say with almost no initial equipment of genius for fiction he has worked his way by sheer dogged perseverance to a manner of expression and a point of view which though they may excite discussion cannot at least fail to rivet attention and enchain interest neither the expression nor the point of view indeed is or is likely to be in any ultimate sense personal to shake off critical preoccupations and to see absolutely for himself seems to be an impossible thing for mr moore but if you compare esther waters or evelyn innes whether for style or insight with some of the authors earlier work what an advance the student of human nature has acquired a real knowledge in some at least of the secret things of the heart the eye of the realist has been trained to discriminate and select to a perception of the significant instead of the obvious in the external shell of life and the pains devoted to mr moores style have not been without fruit verbal melody he generally misses grammatical correctnesssometimes there is no place in paris he will tell you  where you get abettor petite marmite than the ambassadeurs his sentences are frequently stiff and frequently jerky too short or too overloaded with coordination butand it is a big buthe has learned to paint to visualise to callup an image not of the outlines merely but of the atmosphere of a room of a garden of an environment here is one of fifty examples the broad walk was full of the colour of spring and its perfume the thick grass was like a carpet beneath their feet they had lingered by a pond and she had watched the little yachts carrying each a portent of her own success or failure the albert hall curved over tiie tops of the trees and sheep strayed through the deep may grass in arcadian peacefulness but the most vivid impression was when they had come upon a lawn stretching gently to the waters edge owen had feared the day was too cold for sitting out but at that moment the sun contradicted him with a broad warm gleam he had fetched two chairs from a pile stacked under a tree and sitting on that lawn swept by the shadow of softly moving trees they had talked an hour or more the scene came back to her as she sat looking into the fire she saw the spring easily victorious amid the low bushes capturing the rough branches of the elms one by one and the distant slopes of the park grey like a piece of faded tapestry and as in a tapestry the ducks came through the mist in long pulsing flight and when the day cleared the pea fowl were seen across the water sunning themselves on the high branches evelyn inns is an elaborate and minutely analytic study of the musical temperament the heroine is a singer of opera wagnerian opera she is one of those who as plato has it pipe away their souls in sweet and plaintive melodies her spiritual life is confined almost entirely to vague emotions and to such ideas as find their natural expression in musicideas very slightly intellectualised hardly raised above the level of sensations and emotions she drifts along through lifewith mr moore watching and studying her trying to disentangle and isolate the currents iii and out of a couple of liaisons and finally into the bosom of the holy catholic church precisely the same kind of mental processes determine her conversion as those which lead her out of the arms of one lover and into those of another this is the spirit of it   then to rid herself of the remembrance she thought of the joy she had experienced that morning at hearing in the creed that gods kingdom shall never pass away her soul had kindled like a flame and she had praised god crying to herself  thy kingdom shall last for ever and ever it had seemed to her that her soul had acquired kinship over all her faculties over all her senses for the time being it had ruled her utterly and so delicious was its subjection that she had not dared to move lest she should lose this sweet peace her lips had murmured au  our father but so slowly that the sanctus bell had rung before she had finished it nothing troubled her and the torrent of delight which had flowed into and gently overflowed her soul had intoxicated and absorbed her until it had seemed to her that there was nothing further for her to desire the interest of mr moores analysis is undeniable although we own to finding it a trifle too subjective and monotonous the young ladyjs fluctuations carry one rather often over the same ground and we fancy that a broader touch would have enabled mr moore to produce a really more vivid effect the background of the book is filled up with musical discussion skilfully designed to bring into contrast the two sides of music which attach it to the sensual life and the life of devotion respectively we do not presume to sound the depths of mr moores musical lore but we are not surprised that in dulwich  none remembered that dowlands was the name of henry the eighths favourite luteplayer surely his name was dowland and himself a contemporary not of henry but of elizabeth  evelyn innes by georsre moore fisher unwin  evelyn innes it may be remarked at the outset is the best novel which mr moore has yet written in grasp of character and in power of portraying an individual living being mr moore has advanced even since  esther waters of which the best characteristic was the presentation of the heroine but here still more one has the feeling that one is face to face with a reality and that evelyns actions have that inevitableness without which no interest is possible although this novel just as much as its predecessor is a novel with a topic music taking the place of betting as the phase of life on which the fortunes of the characters chiefly depend one is never made to feel that a single incident in the heroines life or a turn in her character is due to any desire on the part of the author to prove a point or elucidate a theory music is the real atmosphere in which evelyn and the other characters live and work out their destinies it is not as is so often the case in novels with a purpose the rarefied atmosphere of the philosopher making experiments on semianimate puppets to have studied music ancient and modern with the care and exactitude here displayed by the author and to have avoided the fault of allowing his subject to overpower his sense of character is in itself a great achievement and all praise is due to him for it but in awarding this praise one almost unconsciously stumbles across what spoils so much of mr moores work it is a great achievement but in almost everything that he does one is more impressed with the difficulty of his task and the labour required to surmount it than with the success great though it may be of his endeavours mr moore somewhere tells a story about himselfin the  confessions of a young man if we remember rightwhich seems to illustrate this characteristic in all his works when he first went to the louvre he tells us he saw no beauty in ingress  la source but manet or some painter whom he admired told him that it was beautiful convinced that his informant was right he went day after day to this picture to study it and find out wherein its beauty consisted until at last after a vast amount of conscientious study he really did find that the picture was most beautiful so in all his work one has a feeling that he is very often right and has attained to the end required but that it has cost him an unconscionable amount of trouble and study to attain it and he seems so proud of all the pains he has been at that he will not spare the reader any of the steps of the journey to his goal mr moore never seems to live anything if we may so put it he always studies it and learns it he has no intuition but he joins to great intelligence extraordinary laboriousbess which secures him the power of rarely making a mistake and as rarely enlightening by a flash of inspiration even with evelyn innes the most living and successful of his characters this may be observed she certainly is a living woman all her actions are perfectly right from her own nature but she is always an outsider a person to be observed not felt of all the greatest characters in fictionjane austens some of thackerays dickenss mr merediths it may be said that not only does the author seem to have lived them but the reader almost can identify himself with them and feel himself saying and doing what they say and do with evelyn inns mr moore may have been on terms of the most intimate acquaintance but he never felt himself in her and the reader also feels that what she does is quite natural from what he knows of her character just as he feels about his cousin or his aunt but he never realises her sufficiently to feel that he would necessarily do the same himself she is really living but she is not living in the most intimate way with though same limitations sir owen asher and ulick dean are wonderfully good up to a certain point they are people one would recognise immediately if one met them in the streetin fact one knows many like them but mr moores art adds nothing to our knowledge of them they are to a certain extent enigmas in life as all men are except perhaps one besides oneself and to just that extent and no less are they enigmas in the novel a consequence of mr moores inability to conceal his laborious methods is that however interesting in some respects his novels may be they are apt to become tiresomely prolix mr moor is crammed full of facts one may imagine him like zola studying for his novels from every available source as zola would have gone he has evidently been to bayreuth and to madame wagners house there he has studied the scores of wagners operas and wagner literature ad nauseam he has been to dulwich and to hyde park and kensington gardens  he has conscientiously paced every inch of the ground which he makes his characters cover but unlike zola he has not acquired the faculty of discarding unnecessary facts the frenchman knows as all frenchmen do that one of the first elements of art is to know when to be silent but mr moore will tell you that evelyn paid her hansom cabman when she left him he will weary you with discussions on wagner and bring in utterly irrelevant disquisitions on balzac in one passage he describes at some length a subscription concert got up by evelyn and in reading the description we wondered if he would add the exact amount secured by it for the charity and sure enough it was duly chronicled this is the reason why some reviewers cry out against disgusting passages in mr moores books now in this one there are some details which could certainly not be qualified as disgusting but which are absolutely unnecessary and which one would prefer not to have mentioned unless there were some very strong dramatic reason for doing so which there is not they are annoying here chiefly because they are so gratuitously unnecessary just as some of his long and inappropriate descriptions of scenes are tiresome they are only worse than the latter because they concern matters on which it is better to be reticent but their real fault is essentially the same that of irrelevance the book however which is worth criticising at such length just because it is so good as a whole and so admirably single in purpose and construction and so marvellous in the way in which all the interest is quite naturally focussed on the heroine must not be dismissed on a reproach the style though still a little lacking in nerve and decision is a great improvement on mr moores former writing and some of his phrases and jottings of character are decidedly pithy and poignant here is perhaps the best of them   lady ducklo appeared to her as one who had never selected a road she seemed to have walked a little way on all roads and her face expressed a life of many wanderings straying from place to place there was nothing as she said worth doing which she had not done but she had clearly accomplished nothing  evelyn innes when sir owen the artistic baronet begins evelyns education seriously in paris one of his first lessons is in balzac  there is a vulgarity he says to her  about those who dont know balzac we his worshippers recognise in each other a refinement of sense and a peculiar comprehension of life we are beings apart we are branded with the seal of that great mind you should hear us talk among ourselves further he says that each of balzacs fiftytwo volumes is a masterpiece now mr moores general methods in fiction do not forbid us to infer that through sir owens mouth he is expressing his own views at all events this personage does express views which mr moore has uttered in his own name such balzacian fanaticism one would hesitate to attribute to him were it not that his manner of working here and elsewhere convicts him of it for a dilettante baronet blind fanaticism is of no consequence but when one of the writingcraft forgets that the honour due to such an incomparable searcher of the human mind must be discriminate in order to be worthy the case is serious for imitation is bound to follow and it so happens that only balzacs weaknesses can be imitatedhis   evelyn innes by george moore 6s unwin formlessness his unjustified and unforgiveable loagxears his unrelieved monotony of manner the admiration for the masters genius has given to the native defects and misfortunes of mr moores talent the shelter and encouragement of a great name mr moore is sometimes reputed to be a dangerous writer but if he sins he does not sin lightly or insinuatingly let that be counted to his credit where it may he admires ciany french things and has learned some part of his craft in a french school yet never englishman was so deadly serious in manner at least there is not a smile anywhere in  evelyn innes not a vivaciousmovement not an unconsidered word but surely he must drive the most unsympathetic reader to unstinted admiration of the work he puts into his books when one compares the quantity and the quality with that which contents most of our novelists one is filled with the highest respect his ideal is that every character should be quite completely presented from the inner recesses of his soul xr george moore frous 4 pakinuis by maxet rproduced by kuxd permission oj musm waiter scott lal to the shape of his boots that of every opinion held by his personages he should be the historian and interpreter capable of writing a leading article on it that every scene should have the local definiteness of modern stage directions that every street or house should be precisely entered in a full catalogue or inventory and he hardly falls short of that ideal with magnificent patience and honest slogging endeavour is his task pulled through when he has to get up a subject he does so without flimsiness this latest novel for instance should be a mine of interest to students of the older music and to admirers of mr dolmetsch his wagner criticism is able and suggestive and of course very timely at the present moment unquestionably he has a rare and admirable respect for his work about the result there will be much difference of opinion to me his manner and method are unpleasing and the abnegation of all art and i feel it much more in  evelyn innes than ia  esther waters where the form and temper were more flaubertianand flaubert if a  little master is a safer guide for mr moore than balzac who tempts him to longwindedness but still he has only exaggerated the course which his kind of temperament his quality of vision must have forced him to take at his best lie is an unsurpassed photographer and as such should he be judged monsignor and his surroundings the wimbledon convent the intense and rather shabby audience at mr innes concerts are masterpieces of the camera only when he is forced to alter some important circumstance of his scenes and sitters le blunders the book is in some degree a romax a clef ulick dean will be widely recognised the ceavexaxces demand that some veil should be thrown over his identity and mr moore makes him a musician he is not 1 transposed  enough what has a musician to do with all those interesting imaginings and philosophies  and evelyn  sir owen told her she was  intensely balzacian very likely the creator of eugenie grandet might have made her comprehensible nothing could be more detailed and more superficially definite than her history as given by mr moore but she is a blur to one careful reader at least at the beginning she lives a shabby and obscure life without ambition though she knows she has a great voice then she agrees to a lse with sir owen a little for love perhaps not a little for fine clothes and fine living and a little for the sake of her voice sir owen gives her rationalistic instruction which does not enter deep into her system she becomes a great singer of great partsisolde kundry briinnhilde then she falls under the more spiritual influence of ulick but his mysticism does not satisfy her then with a thought to her soul she gives up the stage in the midst of her triumph in her convent retreat we think her fate is settled at last but no she comes out into the world again quite aimless what is she meant to be  one leaves her with the idea that she was very stupidbut stupid as are those sensitivists on whom scientific hypnotists experiment most successfully yet we gather that mr moore had some other intention in presenting herthat to him she was a rersonality something has missed his nervous subject fdgeted under the fire of the camera a m  literary bulletin books eviryx inure bv gforrf njoorf fishcer litwin s mr george moore is still a realist he still gives us too much detail and will not trust to the imagination of his reader but he has put aside the coarser and more unpleasant aspects of his manner evelyn inns is a great opera singer who falls under the influence firstly of the agnostic and man of the world secondly of the mystic whose religion is art and thirdly of the priest she is frankly sensual and pleasureloving with her religious feeling is only a sublimated exercise of the senses it can only be maintained through an entire submission to authority and dogma and we are led to suppose that she finds an answer to her needs in the roman catholic church but mr moure leaves our curiosity on this point really ungratified and we hope he may he preparing a sequel in the promised  sister teresa his book is intensely interesting and full of good things about life in general and music in particular the dialogue is a little flat and bald but on the whole his style has gained in charm  evelyn innes by george moore a sixjenny edition much revised and ninety pages shorter

howitt intensely satisfied with his own performance volunteers for the benefit of the reader a statement in behalf of a class of persons calling themselves or called by their dupes spiritualists he introduces a spiritualist or hat and tableturner into this story of australian life and endeavours to justify a stageeffect so monstrous by flinging a modest sneer at prof faraday and bursting into a digression on communications with departed friends the rosicrucian mysteries of friar bacons brazen head and a certain american poet who has written things  among the finest since shelley and byron we will not quote the passage that follows to use a phrase of mr howitts it is  smoke from a plea for the irrational he advances by no natural process to a panegyric upon himself this is honest enough we are gratified to learn that  a distinguished officer in victoria said  mr howitts volumes are not like the colonythey are the colony itself but it is more than amusing to find a long and somewhat ridiculous letter from a gentleman who has never seen australia transcribed as a still more remarkable testimony to the impressions of verisimilitude with every willingness to credit mr howitt as an accurate reporter upon life and realities in the land of gold we cannot accept as  remarkable testimony the opinion of a novelist who had merely  read some thirty books about that country and found mr howitts  infinitely the best quitting the illconsidered and undignified preface we find in the novel a rather commonplace story garnished with pictures at once vivid and simple of colonial life especially among the squatters we have in fact a nearer view of character and manners among the pastures and diggings than was afforded in the two years in victoria mr howitt opens his tale well and in a way to excite an immediate interest the curtain rises upon an old english family wrongfully deprived of its possessions journeying into the interior of australia to live at a station  until things take a new turn the new turn is taken in due course and the curtain descends upon the same family restored to england and to its rightful inheritance the interval is filled with scenes in cities and by flood and field in the colonyrevolving however round tallangetta where the delicate squatters create a temporary home mr howitt paints a gallery of special portraits and does his best to illustrate the kind of life led under such circumstances in australia aa well as the human idiosyncrasies to be encountered  as dr spenser grayson the poetdr woolstan the spiritualistand mr flavel the seer not to repel the reader by dwelling upon these grotesque imaginings we will extract a passage from a trial scene in which mr howitts manner and the nature of his story are exemplified a young man charged with murder is at the bar an eccentric witness in his favour randall has been badgered by the counsel for the prosecution   sir said randall  i have answered you many questions that have nothing whatever to do with the cause at issue and now your position shall not protect you i throw myself on the justice of the court on the impartial spirit of my countrys laws i insist that you answer me one question you have dared to probe my life and endeavoured to blast my reputation before the worldanswer me thiswhat did your father say when at your vehement and repeated solicitation he granted you a last secret interview beneath the banshee oak in dunallen park the haughty lawyer stood arrested at that question as by a supernatural blow which turned him to a statue he appeared petrified by astonishment my father the banshee oak he stammered yes your father the banshee oak said randall outwardly calm yet plainly and justly incensed your father the venerable loni dunallen do you not see him said the homelylooking squatter rising as if inspired and pointing to a particular part of the court all eyes uicludmg those of the terrorstricken lawyer mechanically following his finger do you not see him now leaning on his cane shaken by grief as by a palsy and his bare white head gleaming in the moonlight as he says solemnly you have banished your brother you have killed your mother by a broken heart you have disgraced your family you have deceived and left utterly desolate your father who now stands here alone before god in his age may you repent repent for rather would i see you lying dead on that bod than that the people of the dunallen estates should ever fall into your power in your present unchristian unregenerate temper there was a sensation throughout the court as if a thunderbolt had fallen on it a deathlike silence prevailed and the proud counsel who so lately had born down all before him by his talent and audacity suddeidy dropped on his seat with his head on the table and was even sliding to the floor when some of the other counsel caught him and had him born from the court the sensation throughout the crowd was inconceivable no words could describe it people lawyers all present sprung to their feet all sense of order was lost there was one loud buzz of voices expressing amazement at this most singular occurrence and numbers hastening out to gain further intelligence of the stricken down man at length the officers of the court restored some degree of attention the judge wonderfidly affected rose and summed up compelled several times to pause for composure and when he dismissed the jury to consider their verdict they almost instantly by their foreman pronounced clear and loud the words not guilty this is a melodrama but it is effectively worked up and is a specimen of mr howitts narrative style in description he is more felicitous take this sketch of the diggings twenty thousand people at least were all scuffling together like ants in an ants nest or tadpoles in a pool the whole valley through which ran the creek or brook for several miles was in the act of being turned upside down close as the crowd could press upon each other so as to leave the prescribed number of feet for each party they were digging delving throwing up earth carrying away bags of it supposed to contain the gold to the creek and there delivering it to other crowds who at a long fine of cradles were in as great a bustle throwing in the earth rocking it to and fro under deluges of water from tin dippers there was an incessant noise of rattling cradles and shouting voices strange figures all yellow with clay and disguised in bushy beards and veils to keep off the flies seemed too desperately busy to have time to breathe it was all one agitated scene of elbowing swearing hacking hewing and shovelling not a tree was left standing over the whole great space and the sim flamed down on unsheltered heaps and holes of gravel

B1466	['8469993']	  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival	englishfiction

there are only three characters to speak of in the booksir richard calmady his mother and his cousin the other figures which crowd the stage are of no account and of the three the cousin mme helen de vallorbes is the most conspicuous and the least pleasant it is not a pleasant story at all and those who wish for entertainment and amusement had better avoid it it is a study of life under morbid and unnatural conditions in this respect it suggests reminiscences of  lhomme qui rit for the hero is a man blighted from birth with the curse of physical defect in  notre dame victor hugo also touches upon the same gruesome theme but lucas malet deals with this matter in her own fashion the story is cry simple the history of sir richard calmady begins some months before he was born his father having his leg smashed by a horse in his stable died under theamputationthat followed his legswcrecutoffat the knee in the days of charles ii the illegitimate son of sir thomas calmady an ancestor of sir richard had also lost his nether extremities his unnatural father having driven over the child as they came from the church where he had been marrying another woman the deserted mistress with the

his mother lady calmady who is painted in ideal colours as the most marvellous and devoted of mothers was filled with profound remorse at the effect which her own emotion has produced upon her child she dedicates herself to him and brings him up bravely sir richard himself is represented as almost human perfection cut short at the kneehandsome stately wellformed possessing in every respect an ideal physique with the exception of his shorn extremities the result of the feet being planted on to the extremities of the thighs rendered it impossible for him to be furnished with artificial limbs hence he could only hobble about in a more or less hideous fashion the first half of the book is devoted to a description of how the poor boy thus marred from birth grows up and suffers keenly at every turn from those slights from which   the history of sir richard calniady by lucas malet london metnuen and co 6i8 pages price 6s all his mothers loving care could not shield him his first love

cripples deformity his mother blazing with indignation had flung the child from her path and ordered her to leave the house the little girl had fallen against the wall and inflicted a scar upon her forehead which caused her to regard lady calmady with undyinghatred in her childish wrath she vowed to be revenged and she kept her word returning afterwards when she had made a more or less unhappy marriage she fascinated sir richard who placed his fortune at her disposal with a knightly chivalry declaring that it was all he could do his mother nearly breaks her heart over the lads passion for his cousin but it passes and they agree to marry him to a little english girl of title not so much from any love on his part as from a desire to perpetuate the family and that he may have a son the girl recoils at the last moment from marrying the truncated suitor and sir richard thereupon maddened and despairing determined to have his fling and go to the devil he declares he will go the common way of common coarsegrained sensual men and be of this world worldly he saysi am going to have just all that my money and position and even this wild deformityfor by god i will use that too  what people wont give for love they will give for curiositycan tring me of pleasure and notoriety i am going to lay hold of life with these rather horribly strong arms of mine strong as a young bull apes i mean to tear the very vitals out of living to tear knowledge excitement intoxication out of it making them by right of conquest my own as i cannot have a wife i will have mistresses as i cannot have honest love i will have gratified lust my imagination has been stimulated into rather dangerous activity by the prenatal insult put upon me and now that i have emancipated myself i propose to apply my

in spite of the wreck of all his other gods he continues to cherish in a secret temple of his own as the one pure woman in the world in reality she is a veritable messalina although as the authoress says in a sentence of almost unique coarseness in modern novels the artist was at least as present in her as the whore and to the delineation of this great courtesan with fine aesthetic appreciations and inevitable animality lucas malet devotes herself with a minutenessof analysis much more frequently found in french than in english novels for some reason or other lucas malet appears to be fascinated by this shepanther of a woman she paints her minutely in almost every phase of emotion she describes the woman with the licentious city of naples as a background deliberately laying her snares and completing her arrangements to lure her cousin to his undoing it is not often that in english fiction there is a picture drawn at full length and in vivid colours of the way of a strange woman with the man whom she has marked down for her victim and what makes the thing all the more horrid is the emphasis which lucas malet lays upon the effect of physical deformity as an incentive to sensual desire in the midst of a scene in which helen was plying all her arts in order to fire calmadys blood sir richard had to move his positionshe stared fascinated by that cruel spectacle for the instant transformation of the apparently tall and conspicuously wellfavoured courtly gentleman just now sitting at table with her into this shuffling longarmed crippled dwarf was at first utterly incredible then portentous then by virtue of its very monstrosity absorbing and to her adorable whetting appetite as veritable famine might chastity became to her more than ever absurd a culpable waste of her own loveliness of sensation of emotion a sin against those vernal influences working in this generous nature surrounding her and working in her own blood all the primitive instinct of her womanhood called aloud in her that she must wedmust wed and the strident voice of the great painted city coming up to her urgent incessant carried the same message as did the radiant sea whose white lips kissed the indented coastline as though pale and hungry with love while the nan before her by his very abnormality and a certain secretness inevitable in that heightened her passion he was to her of all living men most desirable so that she must win him and hold him must see and know of course the inevitable result follows she held this man in the hollow of her hand by right divine of beauty wit and the manifold seductions of her richly endowed personality this of her many loves was the crown and the climax as the adulteress hunts for the precious life so this lithe shepanther tracked down her prey and triumphed without remorse in the satisfaction of her revenge and the consummation of her desire like her prototype in the book of proverbs she ate and drank and said  i have done no evil it is very different with her victim calmady who had wilfully trampled under foot all canons of morality and was shocked back into virtue by the sudden destruction of his last ideal  the last of mv selfmade gods he told her has indeed gone overboard he fled from the scene of his undoing took refuge on board his yacht but venturing out feverstricken to attend the opera he was again tracked down by his conqueror who came to him in his box and vowed her determination never to leave him  richard she said very softly laying her hand lightly upon his thighi forgive all i am not satisfied with loving i will come with you i will stay with you i will be faithful to you yes yes even that your love is unlike any other it is unique as you yourself are unique i want more of it  her lips were parted in naughty laughter and then not without a shrinking of quick horror richard beheld the soul in herthat being of lovely proportions exquisitely formed in every part yet black as the foul liquid lanes between the hulls of the money ships dowvn in naples harbourstep delicately in between those parted lips returning whence it came he refused to go with her whereupon she summoned a former lover into the box who struck richard again and again across the face with his metalbuttoned gloves calmady tried to strike him and fell heavily stunning himself as his temples struck the lower step of the descent from the back of the box the man kicked calmady as he lay asking  dear madame are you sufficiently avenged is it enough helen expressed herself satisfied and the two went out into the blackness of the dark night the third part of the book describes the regeneration of sir richard calmady the fever possessed him and he came for a time near to the door of death he was nursed back by his mother who rejoiced to welcome back the prodigal who had found the husks which the swine did eat so very bitter to his taste sir richards repentance was genuine and final his mother had the satisfaction of finding for him an excellent wife from whom he conceals nothing either of his deformities or of his lapses from the straight path her acceptance of him is characteristic and somewhat original  for heavens sake she said  dont take me out of pity i would never forgive you there is a good deal of us both one way and another and we should give each other a hell of a time if i was in love and you were not butshe put her hand on the peak of that very ugly saddle again but if you do care here i am i am yours body and soul marry me she said having made up her mind to accept him she found that his crippling was dearer to her than any other mans wholeness and his wrongdoings dearer than any other mans virtue what wve wonder wvould people think if a man were to say such a thing to a woman like helen everything goes so well that in the last page he tells his mother he is thankful that she brcught him into the world even as he was which was good for the most perfect of mothers to hear speaking of the book as a whole no one can deny its ability or the nerve of its authoress  but whether it is a book which makes altogether for edification is a question upon which readers will

with considerable imaginative power novels may be divided like all other productions of artistic minds into two classes and belong either to the ideal or to the realistic school the minute delineation of life and manners that we get so frequently in novels of the day is more fatiguing and less pleasant than the ideal and even shadowy conceptions given to us by more dreamy and poetical writers we

great difficulty withl which a writer has to contend who belongs to tile more fanciful land romantic school is this that it is not easy to depict character oln a ilaroe and a romantic scale when tile figures can after all be figures of iiien alnd women only the classical artist raises them above the earth by laying the scene of ac tion eithler inl heaven or at least ill that mysterious mythical ge of heroes and demigods the personages of which were surrounded with an indistinct and romantic grandeur it was something more thnm human sorrow which spoke to the greek in the person of an antigone or anl edipus nor was there any dangner of the plot of the story being of necessity either vulgrar on the one hand or improbable and extravagant upon the other a modern author has no such resources as were vouchsafed by the peculiar circulmstances of the age to the classical poet or mythologist he is anxious to tfl from all imitation of common life and in shunning scylla he falls into charybdis he paints men and women for he call paint nothing else  and in endeavouring to remove them fromn the everydav level of comnmon things he often miakcs his plut unnatural improbable and absurdc the effect is that he challengcs and provokes the very comparison with conmmon life that he wishes to avoid his heroes move about as heroes never nion ed before ill this world his heroines place tlieiielves in positions which have no parallel oln eartlh his groups are admirable balt the lights and shadows are overdone and the backg round is a background constructed upon untenable assumptions which seem to do violence to our experience and to conltradict all that we have ever heard or seen wise indeed is the rare and happy novelist who in such a dilemma refrains from mixing in these impossible proportions the idleal and the real and confines himself to making the interest of his piece turn entirely upon the internal play of the feelings or at least upon the siniple and picturesque grouping of the figures rthe more common error is that of the author whose personages and characters charm us by their grace and their truth so loing as they stand still but when they move and act act in violation of the ordinary laws of probability and social experience it is seldom that the reader of fiction comes upon a threevolume novel in which there is as much to please and as little to offend as is to be found in  the cost of a secret the conceptions of character ill it are graceful and refined  nor are the heroes and heroines built in aniy except a truthful mould with the exception of the deus 0 mtackind of the tale a certain ai corsand whose virtues perhaps verge upon the superhuiiian the other male and female characters possess the rare advantage of being at one and the same time both naturally and elegrantly drawn the literary part of the book is done beyond all question well  and on arriving at the close we can feel that in point of taste there has not been a blemish through the whole like agnes trenmorne a novel by the same hand the cost of a secret is framed oln a classical model and by classical fingers both tales belong to the gallery of art in which stand the creations of some of the best modern writers of the classical school but  the cost of a secret has a fault which will not be found in the exjuisite productions of such a novelist as the author of  tranlsformation that the plot should be unreal is not in itself an insuperable objection but the plot which in reality is improbable and unreal is meant beyond all doubt for a plot of real life and as such it provokes a criticism and an investigation which it is unable successfully to bear the merit of the tale would have been greater but for this had the author been contented with elaborating quietly the different admirable characters that had been put upon the scene without introducing them to an impossible complication of circumstances  the cost of a secret might have lost something but it would have gained even more the author was afraid of being dull and determined apparently to create an interest fromn the story itself independently of the characters of the story nor can it be said that the object has been altogether unattained the secret is somewhat transparent and a curious inquirer might discover the key sooner perhaps than the author imagines but the thread of narrative is on the whole well sustained andon the assumption that the narrative was possible at allwould be calculated to interest and pklease unfortunately this assumption is untenable the plan is too fanciful to be hunman there have been nien and women like the men and women we meet in  the cost of a secret and they have been clhriuinir men and women but inever were nmen and women placed in so singular and unlikely a position as that in which the characters o f  trhe cost of a secret  have been placed by its refined nd ind genious author it is owing doubtless to thle imaginative tendlency of the author that all the heroes and heroines of the story are irawn ill some picturesque light or other and never stand except in ain artistic attitiide the authtlor seems to look on them not merely

part we never ventured on anything like a bold guess at the authorship once or twice indeed we were on the point of exclaiming  aut diabolus aut charles lever  and the book still reminds us of the latter more than of any other living writer but why if it were from his pen should it be issued in this queer quiet way  however the  confessions  will make the readers of them laugh very heartily and though there are only two real attempts at sketching character while the whole thing is as slight as a farce and very much like one we fancy that nobody who makes paul gossletts acquaintance will forget his adventures in a hurry the story such as it is is a series of surprises of illluck which we shall certainly not do either the author or his readers the injustice of recounting in an abbreviated shape it is not a new idea but it is none the worse for that gil blas is on the whole a lucky dog from the time when he is sold by the gormandizing scamp at the hotel who informs him that he is the seventh wonder of the world to the  plant we hope to be excused for these vulgaritiesby don raphael and then onward to his misfortune with the bishop who could not bear to be told that his faculties were decaying though he had engaged gil blas expressly to warn him when they showed any symptoms of getting weaker gil blas has adventures of illluck which come upon us unexpectedly paul goeletts confessions  is not a story of character like  gil blas and it is as we have already said exceedingly slight but it does not contain a single surprise which is inferior as a surprise to the don raphael trick in gil blas this praise will not be misunderstood by our readers  gil blas  is a great novel and  paul gosslett  is a farce in the shape of a narrative but it is a farce of genins or something like it the style frequently runs into burlesque but there are numerous touches of humour which will be by no means obvious to inattentive readers and the book stands that difficult test of laughable writingyou can laugh at it more than once it would be quite idle to say to publishers  give up issuing long novels for railway reading and let us have more books like paul gosslett  to take into the train on a journey  because it is not everybody not even every humourist who can produce such books many men might have put as much fun within the same narrow compass150 pagesbut then very few men could have bound the fan up in such a series of naturallybroughtabout surprises and wound up with one more just for fun and when ordinary readers are dull or  full of nothing but vacancy as

any momentary pang of conscience nor hesitating in his vile purpose from any passing gleam of virtue if this wretch stigmatised by nature with a rotten heart and branded by a name that will sound appropriately in the antala of crime fur he is called gosslett if all this and a great deal more in the same fashion is not familiar to the reader it is because he has not carefully studied the demosthenic orations of the court of arches the last clause is poor and commonplace but the absurdity of attaching a special odour of depravity to the bare word gosslett for he is called gosslett a name which if it suggests anything suggests the simple but virtuous gosling is a capital nonsequitur the quivoque of the loveletters of the lady who entrapped him is very amusing it must be understood that gosslett is at the head of a hydropathic establishment in germany and that mrs dacre who plays a part similar to that of the lady in the don raphael episode in gil blas  is a patient  if mrs dacres notes were very brief they were not less enig maticalsbe was the strangest writer that ever put pen to paper thus to give an instance the ice application she always referred to as  my coldness and she would say how long is your coldness to continue have i not had enough of it yet  this coldness is becoming tiresome and if it be continued how am i to go out with you  in another note referring to our intended drive she says i if it is a ques tion of running away i must have a word to say first for though i believe you have no fears on that ecre i am not so courageous virginie had been telling stories about my ponies they were frisky it is true and it was thus her mistress alluded to them some disparagement of me as a whip provoked this remark from her as the time draws newer i

had forgotten on the kitchen table i wish she knew that id be glad she could make dumplings i am fond of dumplings to try and tell her this mrs d suspects lzzie is attached to me i dont think she approves of it d d would not object if i became an orangeman query what effect would that have on my future career could i b3 an orangeman without being able to sing the boyne water   for i never could hum a tune in my life to inquire about this who was the man who behaved badly to lizzy  and how did he behave badly  this is a very vital point though not easy to come at  18blizzy likes i may say loves me the avowal was made this morning when i was carrying up two pounds of sugar and one of soap from the village she said oh mr gosslett if you knew how unhappy i am   the notion of putting this down as an avowal of passion the criticism  this is a very vital point and the memorandum  to try and tell her this  i e that he is fond of dumplings are unctuously preposterous and yet how naturally they are jotted down but of course that is half the fun in all such humour under gossletts management the coldwatercure plan is of course a dead failure but see how he treats the intimation of the proposition that it must be closed as we had at this period eightyfour servants in the house sixteen horses in the stables and a staff of thirtytwo gardeners and boatmen not to speak of runners commissionaires and general loungers i was not amazed when a telegram came in these words close the house place dechworth in charge and come over to london to this i replied  telegram received

called names and i hinted at defamation how they issued an order for my dismissal and i demurred and demanded due notice we fbused each other all september and opened october in full cry of mutual attack and ddfenoe by this time too we were at law they applied for a mandamus to get rid of me and my counsel argued that i was without the four seas of the realm and could not be attacked i ney tried to reach me byr the statute of frauds but thee was ido treaty with nassau and i could not be touched all this contention and quarrelling was like suilpbate of quinine to mei grew robust and strong under the excitement and disoovered a lightness of heart and a buoyancy of nature i had believed had ljng left me for ever and though they stopped my salay and dishonoured mp drafts i lived on fruit and vegetables and put the garrison on the same diet with a liberal allowance of wine which more than reooniled them to tbh system the reader will gather for himself the fun of a flabbyminded man like paul gosslett su sidenly x developing  into energy and fat under the tonic influence of legal proceedings which he knew could never touch him earlier in the narrative when gossletts prospects are particulary gloomy he counts his money finds it just enough to bury him indulges in gloomy thoughts and weeps  i locked the door to be alone with my own thoughts and opening my writingdesk i spread before me four sovereigns and some silver barely my funeral expenses said i bitterly i leaned my head on my band and fell into a mood of sad thoughts i wasrt a bit of a poet i couldnt have made three lines of verse had you given me a million for it but somehow i bethought me of chatterton in his garret and said to myself  like him poor goswlett sunk famished in the midst of plentya man in all the vigour of youth able motive and energetic with a mind richly gifted and a heart tender as a womans i couldnt go on i blubbered out into a fit of crying that nearly choked me   please sir maid the maid tapping at the door  the gentleman in the next room begs you not to laugh so load   laugh burst i out  tell him woman to take care and be present at the inquest his evidence will be invaluable   i tried to take a retrospect of my life and see where and how i might have done better but all i could collect was that i had met nothing but ingratitude and ipjastce while other with but a tithe of my capacity had risen to wealth and honour i fated to evil from my birth fought my long fight with fortune and sank at last ex hausted i wonder will any one ever say poor gosslett i wonder will there beeven late though it beonne voice to dclare  that was no common man gosslett in any country but our own would have been distinguished and honoured to great powers of judgement he united a fancy rich varied and picturesque his tem perament was poetic but his reasoning faculties asserted the mastery over his imagination will they be acute enough to read me thus p will they knowin one wordwill they know the man they have suffered to perish in the midst of them  my one gleam of comfort was the unavailing regret i should leave to a world that had neglected me  yes said i bitterly  weep on and oease not  one more passage gosslett is dispatched on a mission to some brigands in italy while he was thus frothing and foaming i took my hat and passing quietly through the ranks of his household de d the stairs and proceeded into the street  i reached the vittoria  in no bland humour i must own thak i was flurried and irritated in no common degree i was too much excited to be able clearly to decide how far the insult i had received required explanation and apology or if it had prod the limita in which apology is still possible  perhaps thought i if i call him out hell hand me over to the police perhaps hell have me sent over the frontier who known what may be the limit to a minaisters power  while i wa thus speculating and canvassing with myself a card was preseted to me by the waiter mr sponnington attache hts legation nap and as suddenly the owner of it entered the room  he was a fairfaod blueeyed young man very shortsighted with a faint lisp and an effminate air he bowed slightly as he came forward and said  youre mr goewlett aint you  and not waiting for any reply be sat down and opened a roll of papers on the table  here are your instructions you are to follow them when you can you know and diverge from them whenever you must that is do whatever yon like and take the consequences sir james wns southeast you again he says you insulted him but he says that of almost every one the cook insults him when the soup is too salt and i insulted him last week by writing with pale ink that definition of diplomatic instructions do whatever you like and take the consequences is worthy as some reviewers would say to be written in letters of gold everywhere for it is a joke of universal applicationa perfect abridgment of what is known among mankind as 1 a friends advice here and there in these confessions the reader will recognise a hastilysketched likeness the interview with lord palmerston is evidently modelled upon one which actually took place and the glimpse you get of that minister in quite a new light really communicates something worth knowing there is much character in the sketch the reference to  beales on page 52 is surely an anachronism on page 116 we are told that doctors assure us that savages do not have dppepsi but is that so do doctors assure us of anything of the kind or is not the fact quite the other way p while we are finding fault we may just notice that the author falls occasionally into the errorperhaps nearly unavoidableof making gosslett who is a commonplace fellow talk like a man of ability and once more mr tupper is a much overdone topic and cleverer people could afford to leave him alone even if there were no such thing as the golden rule besides to say that traits in that mans writings vibrated in the closer chambers of the heart is to make a bad metaphor in conclusion we will only add that  paul tyossptomis sessions  contains some really good hints of taliy and occasional touches which prove that

B5339	['8513352']	  the adventures of harry richmond the adventures of harry richmond by george meredith in three volumes smith elder and co mr meredith writes cleverly but his cleverness has been turned to very bad account in this latest and apparently most ambitious of his novels it is in the form of an autobiography tracing the history of the hero from his birth till he is about thirty years old and it is doubtless intended to teach us many grand lessons about hereditary weaknesses in particular and all sorts of political and social matters in general towards this end mr meredith sets at defiance all ordinary rules of composition and indulges in the wildest vagaries of plotmaking  but the net result of his efforts is a work so enigmatical and with such constant affectation of wit that it is very irksome reading and so disappointing in the end that the reader who has plodded through the three volumes is likely to vow that he will never take up another of mr merediths novels in saying this we believe we are speaking heresy mr meredith is a prophet to a few and his habit of jerking out commonplaces as if they were wisdom is likely to be fascinating to some young ladies it is a poor habit however and it seems to have worn itself nearly threadbare in  the adventures of harry richmond  is it any waste of time to write of love   says harry richmond  the trials of life are in it but in a narrower ring and a fierier you may learn to know yourself through love as you do after years of life whether you are fit to lift them that are about you or whether you are but a cheat and a load upon the backs of your fellows the impure perishes the inefficient languishes the moderate comes to its autumn of decaythese are of the kinds which aim at satisfaction to die of it soon or late the love that survives has strangled craving it lives because it lives to nourish and succour like the heavens but to strangle craving is indeed to go through a death before you reach your immortality those sentences are a fair sample of the meaningless sententiousness with which mr meredith writes and they are put into the mouth of an utterly selfish man who after keeping at arms length during many years a young lady whom he is only disposed to marry in case another love affair in which he is engaged should prove hopeless at last comes back to her with a lying assurance that he has loved her all along and attempts to induce her then to take him instead of another man to whom after waiting many years for the other she has betrothed herself it may be a good thing to write down the sentimentalism that abounds in novels but it is certainly a bad thing to encourage the view in favour with many fashionable gentlemen that lovemaking is a lordly pastime for the superior sex only culpable when it leads to actual seduction or adultery and that womens hearts are only toys to play with or coin to profit by  and this is the gospel that mr meredith preaches harry richmonds history would have made the thread of a good novel had it been told simply and without praise he is the son of an unprincipled adventurer who is  the son of an actress and somebody and who accordingly spends everybodys money that he can get hold of in carrying on a lawsuit for recognition of his claims upon royalty and is meanwhile living as much like a prince as he can when he is not in a debtors prison harry richmond has in squire beltham a rich grandfather by his mothers side and the blunt honest squires character is not ill drawn though the drawing is a rough and exaggerated sketch not a finished portrait the squire wishes to make him his heir on condition of his renouncing his father and in the hope though this is wit an absolute condition that he will marry his cousin janet harrys father plays at higher game he maintains tn underhand connexion with his son squanders his monmr and schemes for his marriage with a german prhuazl thus after an account of harrys childish and schoolboy life which is perhaps the best portion of the book t2a complications of the story are brought about mr men dith has some power in constructing his puppets au the leading figures in the novel are sharply cut and many of the minor characters are fairly elaborated and individual ised  but they are only puppets they speak and act un naturally and if taken one by one some of them are tolerable their combined action is as preposterous as that of the puppets in a punchandjudy show mr meredith describes english life not as it is but as it pleases him to represent it and his description is alike unpleasant and unprofitable this is the more to be regretted because he throws out hints and collects rough material enough to stock two or three good novels with proper handling	englishfiction

the story the authors style is singularly vigorous and graphic he wastes no words condenses his thoughts and accomplishes by a single happy touch what writers of less genius employ a paragraph to elaborate it is evident that though as yet nameless an aspirant has stepped into the arena of literature who will ere long win for himself a conspicuous place lie has all the elements of success and only practice is wanted for their perfection his plot however is less entitled to praise its prominent features are borrowed from the stock incidents of the circulating library every one is familiar to the novelreaderthe gypsy warningsthe murder and the trial the whim that possesses a gentleman to assume the character of gardener that he may make acquaintance with the true character of a lower class of society these are hackneyed themes and would have consigned a whim and its consequences to speedy oblivion but for the original manner in which they are narrated character too is drawn with a few strokes of the pen so as to be distinctly comprehended and whether he attempts humour or pathos the author is equally happy in rousing the sympathies of his readers this sparkling style will be best exhibited by a few extracts and we are sure that all who read them will be desirous of perusing the work itself therefore the libraries may order it with assurance of a demand we last week

letters of seeking fame and recompense by mental exertion but he now asked himself who is it wrote this splendid essay  what has been his reward in life  who will ever hear of him a what will be his

the end of a novel with much the same respect as we do the crust at the lower side of an old bottle of choice port wine we would not disturb it for the world there are however persons who insist on your taking your dose of medicine well shaken together  but alas  in religious works the particles refuseto assimilate and at one time you have all the unctuousness of the oil at another all the

a clear pleasant tonic there are no lees and no muddy combination of perfect goodness and thorough wickedness we can confidently recommend the vintage the tale is in itself a beautiful moral and yet

book the same skilful use is made of real history how much have we all been indebted to novelwriters for our knowledge of history it would seem to us that shakespeares historical plays scotts novels and some others give a far greater insight into the past than the most careful collection of state documents there is as much difference as to the influence of such works on our memory and hearts as

centres in the elder of the twins the more gentle having foeen killed in a feud it is this character which is foest delineated his faults and ardent temperament gradually give way to his mothers

mekenzie familiarly called the king of borva is wooed and wedded by mr lavender a london artist and the greater part of the novel is taken up by her adventures in her new southern home the story of a child of nature being suddenly transferred into the blazing eentre of civilisation is nct unprecedented in truth or fiction the changes of aspect which a character deprived in this way of its proper foil offers to the eye of the world and particularly to that of an infatuated and often alas  too soon disappointed lover are indeed too striking not to attract the inquiring attenticn of the psychological observer readers of goethes autobiography cannot but remember with sympathetic pity for both parties the irrepressible feeling of incongruity with which the lively graces of the sebenbeim beauty struck the sensitive poet in a strasburg drawingroom of more modern treatments of a similar subject we may mention a novel by berthold auerbach the plot of which shows a faint similarity with mr blacks story and les amants a powerful though repulsive work by m hector malot in both these the result is tragic and ends in the more or less thorough destruction of the illmatched couples mir black has approached the problem from a different side ihe wants to show that a trulygreat nature will evince its intrinsic value even under the most un favourable circumstances and therefore he does not make the inevitable breach between the heroine and her husband irremediable it on the contrary turns out to have the most favourable consequences causing the katharsis of the worldlyminded mr lavender and resulting ultimately in the happy reunion of the lovers we fully admit the psychological truth and beauty of this solution but must regret at the same time the almost trivial manner in which the catastrophe is brought about the dleut of sheila in a london drawingroom is not as successful as her husband had expected it would be society is willing to acknowledige her claims to personal beauty but cannot see in her the sublime princess of the north as which she at first appeared to the romantic fancy of her enchanted lover in consequence he occasionally neglects her and i even begins a slight and as it afterwards turns out very innocent flirtation with a fascinating american widow sheila feels thoroughly discontented with her situation she is yearning for her beloved north and in a fit of nostalgy she contrives to adorn her husbands smokingroom with shells and bell heather in exactly the same manner as her i fathers parlour in borvabost so as to awaken old remniniscences and hint at the same time at a former promise to live part of the year in the western isles a cousin of hers half confidante half servant who has just arrived on a visit is also to act on the same occasion but unfortunately her husband has invited some grand friends for luncheon that day tile american beauty amongst them and when in consequence he refuses in rather a rough manner to let the scotch peasant girl partake of the feast the highminded princess of the north calmly walks into the kitchen orders luncheon for her husbands guests and after that takes the nearest fourwheel cab and drives with her country cousin to a queer old aunt of her husbands who quotes marcus aurelius and has her food weighed out to her for sanitary reasons here she lies hidden for some time i refusing steadfastly to return to her husband even passing him in the street without speaking the cause or at least the occasion of this crisis we think utterly inadequate and unwarrantable from a psychological point of view it may happen in the course of nature that young married people before their individualities are blended by mutual forbearance begin by quarrelling about trifles but then such qutvrlles vpaiour blow over as quickly as they arise but that a highminded and loving wife such as sheila is described should in this way desert her home and duty is utterly incredible the consequences of these rash steps ate however beneficial in more than one respect mr lavender who hitherto has considered his art more in the light of an amusement now makes an effort he leaves london for the wild scenery of jura and shows his repentance by means of honest and successful work another advantage of the catastrophe is the removal of the story from london the gloing de scriptions of northern nature in its wildness and beauty forui a striking contrast to the sketchy manner in which the heroines london life is delineated particularly the strange effects of arctic sunsets are

B81	['8484348']	  the spanish match or charles stuart at madrid  nn ittail rw  t ll by william harrison ainsworth chapman and hall the  house of seven chimneys has for some months been exciting the lovers of romanoe in bentleys miscellany and the story being concluded reappears with the above title mr ainsworth has long held undisputed sway as grand master of historical narrative and this his latest work is a valuable addition to the series which he has provided for that class of readers who delight in the romance of history and of these there is even now we are happy to observe no want it might be regretted that the tide has ceased to set in favour of this style of literature were it not that the author of these three exciting and pleasant volumes has a monopoly in it and is unapproachable in his treatment of incidents well known but which in hie hands obtain a fresh and delightful novelty mr ainsworths historical novels have always the great merit of being the work of a man whose interest in details of the past is strong and whose points of local and historical colouring are accurate as any antiquary could desire while he remains true in spirit to the stir and bustle and the very phrasing of the school of romance in which he graduated long ago with firstclass honours the freshness of his treatment of old themes is very noticeable few readers for instance are ignorant of the sentimental journey of charles in search of a wife yet the way in which mr ainsworth takes advantage of a readymade tale is so skilful that it is impossible not to read it with an interest ever springing and entirely new this is a remarkable faculty possessed by the author who has led many youthful students entranced by his manner of relating facts to seek in authentic records a confirmation of the narrative which has so enthralled their imagination this is no small merit and one which since the great sir walter few can claim we welcome therefore this royal romance of real life and follow the adventures of the chivalrous prince and his companions with infinite amusement and pleasure and are convinced that the book will be one of the author8 most popular productions in these days of dramatic adaptation we feel convinced that any enterprising manager would find in mr ainsworths picturesque volumes ample material of bullfights processions and tournaments for a gorgeous spectacle combined with a very interesting lovestory the story opens with king jamess perplexity as to the chances of the spanish match succeeding and by the daring and promptitude of buckingham whose character is admirably kept up throughout the important decision is arrived at that the heir apparent shall have his desire and cross the seas in quest of his lady love the adventurers meet with their first peril directly they reach the french shore jack and tom are the names chosen by the prince and buckingham just at the hour of two in the afternoon they entered the harbour of boulogne and after some little delay were permitted by the officers of the port to disembark and charles for the first time set foot in france cottington having concluded all arrangements with captain pynchen before landing jack and tom underwent no detention on that score but followed by a couple of sailors carrying their baggage proceeded to the ecu dor in the grande rue where they were welcomed by a very civil landlord who told them they were too late for the table dhdte but considerately added that he could speedily set an excellent dinner before them this was agreed to but the dinner was not served so promptly as promised and being copious took some time to discuss consequently it was hard upon four oclock before the travellers were in the saddle attended by two gailydressed postilions wearing enormous jackboots and who made the quay eoho with the claogour of their horns they rode out of boulogne and crossing a wooden bridge over the liane took the road to montreuil where they proposed to pass the night and where they arrived without accident or interruption about seven oclock and took up their quarters at the tele de bceuf renowned for its pates de becassines rising betimes next morning they were all on horseback soon after seven and on the way to amiens which they determined to make the limit of that days journey all the party were in high spirits to charles the novelty of travelling in a foreign land was exciting and though the country through which he rode was uninteresting in a picturesque point of view in his present frame of mind it became invested with charms such as many a really beautiful landscape had not revealed to him fortunately the weather was fine and the state of the roads good so that the travellers got on without annoyance a joyous company they wereas joyous and lighthearted aa any that bad preceded them on the aame route whether it was change of clime and scene or the excitement they had previously undergone that occasioned this gaiety none cared to inquire being perfectly satisfied with the result even sir francis cottington who had been so strongly averse to the expedition yielded to the enlivening influences and began to view the project with a hopeful eye though maintaining hia habitual gravity of look charles at heart was as gleeful as his companions never had be been more entirely free from the melancholy which usually oershadowed himnever was the present more void of gloom iever did the future look brighter sometimes in order to indulge in fit of pleasant musingto dwell upon the charms of his mistressto conjure up the idea ot their first interview and his transports on beholding herhe would ride apart from the othersbut he soon returned to join in their lively chat in this manner they advanced on their journey scarcely aware how much they had accomplished after skirting the forest of crecy close to which the famous hattie was won by edward iii the thought of which roused the

to admit of doubt upon the point observed m de nouvion  of course it is not for us to make a remark if the prinoe of walea and the lord marquis choose to travel incognito  i will speedily convince you

a brooch the counterpart of which fastens the cloak of your brother jack   a 8 fast as the lively party ride onwards adventures pour in upon them and there is no lack of peril and danger to surmount by their ready wit and fearless courage mr ainsworth must have visited the land he describes so well and we predict that his work will be admitted as one of the best guides for travellers to madrid in future just as sir walters romance of the loire was accepted in that locality we are not sure that archie armstrong was really tossed by a bull in the presence of the infanta but as every character introduced is known to history and most of the incidents did really happen we are content to take that episode for granted and laugh in good faith the pretty appearance of the dove is not imaginary and although it misled the sentimental prince into false hope seemed made expressly to heighten the effect of a love scene and is duly seized upon by the acute romancer charles arrived at madrid after escaping brigands and inconvenient recognitions at length sees the object of his wishes of the meeting between chaelbs and thb xneaeta mabia the old palacio beal of madrid to which our story refers must not be confounded with the existing palace which comparatively speaking is a modern building being only completed about a hundred yean ago the ancient structure was in fact the moorish alcarar and bad been the abode of the caliphs till they were driven from new castille to granada it waa first occupied as a palace by enrique iv towards the close of the fifteenth oentury but few changes were made in it till the time of charles v when the pile was partially rebuilt and enlarged and its original character materially destroyed philip ii may be said to be the first christian monarch who dwelled within the alcazar of madrid for until the completion of the eeoorial in 1584 he made it his chief residence not till the reign of thia gloomy monarch did madrid itself become the capital of spain and from the same epoch must be dated the importance of the city few changes were made in the alcazar by philip iii who was perfectly content with thepalaee bequeathed to bim by bit illustrious sire and philip iv had as yet been too short a time on tba throne to attempt any improvements though heterogeneous in its architecture and certainly not so beautiful as it bad been in the days of its moslem rulers the roysl palace of madrid was a vast and magnificent pile occupying a most commanding position on the heights overlooking the valley of the manzanares immediately beneath the royal edifice extending from the foot of the eminence on which it stood to the banks of the river was the campo del moro part of which was laid out as gardens viewed cither from the grand plaza from the valley or from afar the palsce presented a moat striking and picturesque appearance it was entered by two moorish gates the beautiful architecture of which was happily undisfigured and the buildings

B6518	['8508466']	  a county family a novel by the author of  lost 51 va1 tinalev brothers sir massingberd 3 vols tinsley brothers this is one of a large class of novels which it is very difficult to describe yet there are few more interesting studies in literature than the attempt to discover the peculiar difference that exists between the true and genuine novel which contains actual portraits of living and veritable people and the counterfeit novel which has only the raw materials of fictionthe simulacra of life these latter novels seem to us but a heap of dry bones over which the author has breathed in vain they will not stir in spite of his best endeavours the characters are mere puppets which imitate the movements of men and women and yet show clearly to the spectator the strings by which they are moved nevertheless it is possible to take some interest in watching the different combinations which the master of the puppets produces there is often in these novels the outline of a stirring and dramatic story which the inexperienced novelreader will regard with interest the experienced novelreader on the other hand is content to watch the evolutions of the story with curiosity he says to himself  what is to be the next combination of these puppets  surely it is time for the villain to make his appearance a murder at least is due in the next chapter will the hardhearted father be made to relent or will he be killed off   we repeat the story of some of these novels is frequently highly ingenious the kaleidoscopic changes of position are marvellous considering the monotonous sameness of the materials used and as we wish to say as much as possible in favour of the industrious and painstaking author of  a county family we will preface some brief account of the novel by remarking that the story is likely to be very interesting to those whose individual power of imagination may lead them to fancy that they are regarding real men and women in  a county family we find a good many old friends there is the obdurate father the lover who is forbidden the house the faithful heroine the mercenary suitor the villain who has murdered his wife and who torments everybody until the bursting of a reservoir swallows him up tet before the author settles down to the level jogtrot of storytelling we catch a glimpse of one figure which promises much anthony blackburn when we are first introduced to him looma large and distinct out of the mist of vague and commonplace detail which smothers the story we cannot help suspecting that the author of  a county family had some definite original in his mind when he sketched this character so true and lifelike is the old man until he gets enveloped in the conventional meshes of the tale and disappears from sight this anthony blackburn is an old man who in his youth married a country wench and was thereupon disinherited by his father and sent forth into the world to earn his own living when we meet him he ia a quarryman earning his daily bread on the side of one of the welsh mountains he is possessed by the one idea that he will yet become the owner of the family estates hia younger brothers who have according to the fathers will successively taken possession of the property have one by one been removed by death they and their offspring until there stands between him and the estates only one young man at the opening of the story old anthony blackburn haa just had his dinner brought bim by his granddaughter ellen in presence of a visitor assasd stsahope family anthony blaekbura waa

stepping hastily forward offered the silver bottom of hit pocketflask in place of the broken tumbler  if you will permit me to fill it with sherry instead of water said he politely41 have more here than i require u nay sir i do not drink wineat present responded the old man stiffly and yet since you are to courteousyet i will just taste it it was curious to tee hit look at the costly cap era he put hit lipt to its contents they had not touched silver he was thinking for half a century how excellent wat this liquor the like of which though it wat but hotel sherry had been to long a stranger

face bronzed with sun and wind turned suddenly quite pale good morning sir and thank you it it time for me to begin work again with that he took up hit accustomed weapon but the visitor who at this hint had retired to tome distancenoticed that he did not make a stroke with it for several minutes but stood leaning on the long handle at if in thought stanhope looked round for the girl but she had disappeared and then for the overlooker but he had also slipped away so shrugging his shoulders he lighted a cigar and betook himself down the unprotected incline notwithstanding that a bugle had just blown to give warning to all to seek shelter the granddaughter ellen whose father is dead is betrothed to a young engineer named john denton who ia a sort of overseer at the quarry in which anthony blackburn works she has an uncle the eldest son of old anthony who is the family bugbear this william blackburn is quite a typical villain he has just completed a term of imprisonment when we find him idling in one of the channel islands he has married a poor girl whom he brutally illuses in fact his conduct towards women throughout the whole book is peculiar it must have cost him an uncommon deal of trouble to be so officiously and pertinaciously offensive we are led to believe that villainy is very hard work and that if it waa william blackburns business to furnish forth the  dreadful example  to everybody around him there was never poor mortal so dreadfully overwrought the author gives him neither sleep nor rest he must be continually sulking at some one or cursing at some other or threatening a third indeed the author of  a county family  has on previous occasions shown an amount of cruelty towards his villains which is much to be regretted there never was such a slavedriver if the characters in a novel had any will of their own we feel assured that this writers villains would  strike and refuse to have all the business of the story thrown upon their shoulders mr tates is another writer who used to overwork bis villains but of late he has become tenderhearted and much lem of a taskmaster before however saying anything of what mr william blackburn is made to do in  a county family let us take a last look at his father before he becomes nebulous old anthony blackburn does inherit his own estates and returns thither aa he drives up to the door of the house with his wife and granddaughter beside him a number of the tenantry and neighbours are collected he stops the carriage and addresses them and there is something very fine and natural about these unpremeditated and earnest words neighbours and friends said he in a hoarse voice  i thank you for your welcome tonne ought to know me well though you do not but that it not my fault nor yours i thought to stand

certain that all other critics will most completely take that trouble off our hands we merely announce its appearance in three orthodox volumes and feel that we shall very shortly have to announce its dispersion all over the reading world not to do thus much would be putting a sort of slight upon our readersto do more we are much more capable than inclined  japhet in search of his father by the author of jacob faithful 3 vols we are acquainted with few novels in our language that has been received with more general approbation than the jacob faithful  of captain marryat the humour the drollery the truth and fidelity of the descriptions the force of outline with which the characters were drawnall pleased in spite of many defects in the formnaof the story the beauties and faults of the present novel however inferior it may be to its predecessor are the same it abounds in spirit liveliness variety of character drollery of adventure and vis cornica throughout to be sure its comedy is always on the borders of farce and as long as effect is produced no matter what it costs the whole is a wondrous web of incongruities and impossibilities such as no picture of human life ever presented scarcely one event is even probable scarcely one character consistent but if the taste of the author is to be called in question in collecting such materials for his edifice his skill and genius must the more be praised for that he has been able to give it if not the proportions of classical design at least sufficient attractions to detain the attention and delight the fancy few of the characters are well drawn on the whole all of them clever and vigorous and characteristic in parts we do not think there is much continued interest in the fate or fortunes of any of the dramatis personae and it matters very little how the whole narrative endt but the separate incidents are very agreable and very absurd the portraits are certainly not by lawrence but rather in the free style of h b and the whole is an assembly of the most extraordinary people and in the most extraordinary circumstances that ever took place whether we speak of mr phineas cophagus the apothecary at smithfield who was gored by a mad bullturned quaker and so onreturned churchman and so onand then was gored again at the distance of a quarter of a century whether by the same bull or not we cannot savor miss aramathea judd whose character we take to be the most inventive that our author ever imposed on the credulity of his readers that young ladies wearfalse faces we potently believe but seldom with miss judds design of passing for their grandmothers the other is an irish baronet sir h de clare who and his lady turn gipsies and mountebanks and what not as for the hero of the tale himself who mistakes every man with a long nose for his father and seeing the bishop o exeter the then bishop enjoying an unusual longitude of proboscis fixes on him as his parent to the no small astonishment of the virtuous prelate who cures lady maelstrom of hysterics by pouring a bottle of marking ink into her mouth instead of eaudecologne and then to correct his mistake bv following it up with a quart of stinking green water where flowers had been placed who passes himself off to lord windermere as his son who is taken up and condemned for highway robbery who is confined in the cellar of an irish castle and all but murdered who gives himself out in london as a young man of ten thousand a year who sets up druggist at reading who turns quaker for love of a young quakeress who finds at last his father looking like a large bengal tiger and who at tle first interview seizes the paternal crutches by way of behaving himself prudently and making a good firstimpression knocks down the black domestics of his astonished infuriated and venerable parent finally who married the very prim starch and conscientious young daughter of the aminadabs as for himwe shall close our observations with

B8606	['4855546']	  elster9s folly elsters folly by mrs henry wood 3 vols cr svo pp 945 sis gd tinsleybrothers through history of a vacillating man without any great faults but allowing himself to be drawn into many scrapes and even serious dangers from want of moral courage to resist temptation the principal character is well conceived and drawn out with much spirit the plot is well woven and the interest of the tale preserved by a clever illusion put upon the reader which is not cleared up till at the dose of the novel but we do not consider that the writer has been so successful with another of her dramatis personce the dowager countess of kirton this lady may be a photograph of some living person but is far too gross a caricature to be a representative of good society the most remarkable quality observable in the countess dowager apart from her great breadth was her restlessness she seemed never still her legs had a fidgetty nervous movement in them  and in moments of excitement which were not unfreqnent she was given to excecute a sort of wardance old she was not but her peculiar graces of person her rotund form her badlymade front of flat flaxen curls which was rarely in its place made her appear so a bold scheming unscrupulous vulgarminded woman who had never been considerate of other peoples feelings in her life whether they might be her equals or her inferiors we cannot help feeling that this sketch must be introduced for the purpose of gibbeting some enemy  although perchance it may be only for the sake of producing a contrast with the delineation of the handsome elegant elster who becomes her victim the dowager countesss language moreover is more suitable for the mouth of a ladysmaid or a housekeeper than for that of a lady if ever i saw such behaviour in all my existence with many like expressions which seem to us not in keeping with the rank of the person who utters them elster is the younger brother of lord hartledon and is much snubbed by lady kirton who is a cousin but pretends to be an aunt in order to fix herself at hartledon house percival elster is much in debt and much in love with miss ashton daughter of the rector of caine near the family seat of the elsters lady kirton has brought her daughter lady maude to stay with lord hartledon in the hope of catching him a quarrel arises between val elster and his brother the earl owing to a mistake made by a bailiff in arresting the latter as mr elster lord hartledon goes to the rectory that he may prove himself not to be his brother and there lets out the state of his brothers affairs by which unlucky incident val is forbidden to visit miss ashton any longer elster is very indignant with his brother and they have a quarrel in consequence a boatrace takes place some time afterwards and lord hartledon is missing having injured himself and rendered himself helpless he is found at last drowned at the inquest there is amystery about the accident and a man named pike who has been a squatter on the estate evidently suspects mr elster of having somehow a share in his brothers death lady kirton without the smallest scruple sets herself to separate elster and miss ashton and marry the new earl to her own daughter this she effects by means of underhand letters to the ashton family and by bullying elster in another of his follies the crowning one of being engaged to two women at the same time and being persuaded into marrying the one he does not really love after the marriage a secret trouble falls on the new earl of hartledon he has evidently committed some great crime which renders him a slave to a man who visits him and holds long interviews with him a mr carr a barrister is his friend and stands by him in every way lady hartledon learns the secret at last and being subject to heart complaint at the shock of an accident to her son dies and after a while lord hartledon marries ann ashton and pensions off dowager lady kirton we are then permitted to discover that the secret is that val elster had suffered himself to be entrapped into a scotch marriage before he married lady maude kirton  consequently her children are illegitimate the skill of the novelist is displayed most in keeping up the suspicion of the reader that  elaters folly  is murder and not bigamy this is managed with very considerable power the authoress appears more at home in drawing the characters of boys and young men than of ladies we do not think miss ashton herself with her brusque manner is very loveable some characters from low life are much more true to nature the sketch of mrs green a timid woman given to fits apparently but really having to conceal the secret return of a son who lives near her disguised as the min pike is well worked out the story although conveying the feeling of a tragedy turns out at last to be but a serious comedy elster is in spite of his folly a kindhearted wellmeaning man and thoroughly enlists our sympathies although he angers us by his weakness there is so much ability in this ladys novels that we have ventured to be more critical of the defects than we should otherwise have been there is the means of exciting interest in her hands without overstepping the limit of probability the character of elster improves under his trials and we cannot but admire the moral tone which is given to the work by his selfinflicted sufferings while at the same time we cannot but do justice to the liberal spirit in which the faults of mankind are treated the style is easy and readable  an acquaintance with the different classes of society is manifested the description of the young scamp the boy kipper is particularly lifelike the authoress has a special talent for depicting boysa race generally not much in favour with ladies she enters into their ways and feelings and hits off their characteristic heedlessness and generosity with a hearty sympathy which speaks well for her powers of appreciation it is something nowadays to meet with a writer who can draw lifelike characters and yet elicit from her story a good moral teaching such as we have set before us in  sisters folly	englishfiction

of endeavour mrs  norton throughout her long literary career  has allowed herself intervals for repose j and study between the appearances of her i publications she has been no prolific author j i embarrassing the libraries with volumes written  for what sportsmen and painters term  the i pot rather than for those nobler ends the  achievement of which is the artists chosen and peculiar sport but whatever has come from j her pen possesses a measure of those higher j qualities without which the labour of the scribe j is but the labour of him who writes his name in water  old sir douglas is not without defects but it is a book that will satisfy the expectations of mrs nortons many admirers and is worthy of a writer who having been a personal witness of much that is most brilliant in human society and a sufferer of much that is most sad in human life describes with equal candour and vividness though things that she has seen and the sorrows that she has felt its pages are alive with the old sympathy for good women writhing under slander though old abhorrence of certain kinds of masculine selfishness and brutality the old fierce contempt for the malignity and harshness of selfrighteous women  who havo a larger measure of charity for i triumphant sin than downtrodden virtue in i these respects the novel resembles tales that  preceded it but in some particulars the story  contrasts favourably with most works of fiction j which aim at enlisting sympathy in behalf  of women on whom social opinion has put the brand of shame its judgments and indignation are less onesided and defiant than they would have been had the book been written in times less remote from incidents which first inspired the author to exclaim against mnns  violence and womans spite another indica tion of the change which soothing influences i have wrought in a mind that notwithstanding i its championship of injured innocence was  formerly more alert to fight the strong than to i respect the feeble is the tenderness exhibited  towards weak things simply because they aro  weak for instance in all that concerns the l ludicrous repellent imbecility of lady chari lotte skifton mrs norton shows a fine com passion for failings that rouse in ordinary j spectators no kindlier sentiment than derision  but the feature of the book for which the  author will be most commended by moralists is through the goodness of gertrude skifton whose i tribulations are the chief source of the readers entertainment usually in novels written with the special purpose of  old sir douglas the wretched heroine is guilty of indiscretions that give countenance to the assertions of her calumniators but from her girlhoodbefore  she encounters her future husband until ho is i induced to impute to her extreme wickedness and further on through her career until her long endurance of cruel misconstruction terj initiates in the vindication of her honour and  the recovery of his affectionate confidence

that is the sharpi est part of the punishment which social opinion i  assigns to certain sorts of conjugal infidelity   the woman thus cruelly sinned against though   never sinning is brought upon the

suppose him disqualified by years to j j win the love of a young girl mrs norton is careful to endow him with personal attrac j tiveness as well as a sublimely chivalric dis a position there is no example of human t beauty more perfectly picturesque than a very f handsome man of middle age is the bold a statement with which the story commences t and in sir douglass case this grand pictur   esqueness is united with moral graces that j t justify the authors flattering commendations t of middle age as the period of life in which i men of true heroic stuff and mould are seen  to best advantage at the age of which i 1 am speaking says the novelist  small annoy 1 ances have ceased to afflict great hopes and  i fears are subject to a more noble reserve the  passionate selfishness of inexperience has van   ished the restlessness of learning how much or how little life can achieve is calmed down the smile of welcome in such a mans countenance is worth all the beauty of his adolescent years this is both true and happily expressed with respect to those exceptional natures that like fullbodied wines ripen and mellow under the silent action of time and it is none the less true because it may render  old sir doughs popular with certain habitual occupants of seats at clubwindows to whom the praise is by no means applicable every fact of sir douglass career is consistent with the compliments thus lavished upon him by his creator at the outset of the story no taint of selfishness or vanity or hardness alloys though excellence of this perfect model of gentle manliness

as he does not tell his love and felix lets her know without hesitation that he adorem her she accepts the younger brother a step which no lady of wellregulated affections could possibly take if she

B8841	"['9426749', '4363886']"	  the shadow of ashlydyat by mrs henry wood 3 vols bentleywe consider the shadow of ashlydyat to be the best novel that mrs wood has written it has not the romantic and painful interest of  east lynne but it is a better constructed story and for  steadily accumulating interest where the reader is made to feel every character and incident real and true as if it had come under his personal knowledge we do not know a novel of the present day to be compared with it the power to draw minutely and carefully each character with characteristic individuality in word and action is mrs woods especial gift this endows her pages with a vitality which carries the reader to the end and leaves him with the feeling that the veil which in real life separates man from man has been raised and that he has for once seen and known certain people as intimately as if he had been their guardian angel thisisa great fascination it is not produced by means of metaphysical analysis or philosophical insight mrs wood rarely ventures on a general observation and never goes into metaphysics but she steadily minds her business tells her story carefully and completely and works out her characters with an instinctive knowledge of what they would say and do under the given circumstances which is never at fault her writing resembles good french acting for the skill and care she bestows upon her details without giving them undue prominence at first the number of characters in ashlydyat and the variety of interests introduced may seem likely to prove perplexing but every personage and every incident is so carefully drawn and the threads of the story are kept so distinct that the reader is never oppressed or confusedthe web of conflicting interests is skilfully woven the readers entertainment is well cared for and never flags throughout the story the story concerns the fortunes of the godolphin family who live and have lived for many generations in a stately old house called ashlydyat which with its lands was formerly church property there is a tradition that so long as the godolphins remain in ashlydyat they will be prosperous but if they quit it their ruin will follow also there is a strange unaccountable phenomenon which appears whenever misfortune or death is approachinga shadow which has the aspect of a bier with coffin and mourners in the midst of a graveyard full of tombstones  and this shadow comes over a bare uncultivated portion of land where there is nothing to throw a shadow or t account for the strange appearance this shadow recurs in the story like the refrain of an old ballad and mrs wood assures the reader that this appearance is not her own invention but that the  shadow as well as the chief portions of the story are true of course very few of the people most concerned believe in the superstition  amongst the rest lady godolphin sir georges second wife is the most obstinate of the sceptics she hates the sombre stately old place and insists upon building a pleasant villa at a little distance contriving to take her husband away to live in it when finished this seems to be the first step towards the declension of the family fortune s  but the old prophecy is so skilfully blended with the practical results of individual conduct that it has the effect of an old greek fate unless wc were to write out the whole book we could not give an account of the story there are so many characters each following his own devices yet so linked together by circumstances that a bald outline of the tale would convey no idea of the book sir george godolphin has been at the head of a longestablished bankone of those old county banks in which the surrounding country believes far more devoutly than in the bank of england after sir georges death the younger son being a full partner gets into the hands of verrall the moneylender a cleverly indicated character by his means and the blandishments of a questionable young lady miss charlotte pain young godolphin is led on to ruin and to crime this sounds common place enough but it is in the working out of this main fact and in the variety of incidents involved that the strength and charm of the story lie we think that mrs wood has dealt too leniently with the gay and gallant george godolphin whose sins bring so mach woe upon innocent people but even the female reader will be constrained to forgive miss charlotte pain unprincipled as she is for the sake of her thorough goodnature thomas godolphin is a noble character the episode of ethel grame the girl to whom he is engaged is skilfully managed maria the wife of george godolphin is sure of the readers sympathy she is a sweet and perfect wifetoo perfect for if she had expressed her own good sense with more emphasis it would have been better though not so pleasant for the erring mr george in all the details of the personal and private troubles which follow the great catastrophe of the bank mrs wood has shown skill but it must not be supposed that the shadow of ashlydyat is an oppressive bookthe readers interest is never sacrificed and it is a book that he may return to with pleasure  thie shadow of

his bibulous habits to be an authority on the subjectthe introducer into england of milkpunch she has left behind her apart from her published or acted works few trustworthy memories her origin is a matter of dispute according to accepted biographies she was of aristocratic birth and surroundings her father whose name was johnson member of a family established in canterbury being a relative of lord willoughby by whose interest he was appointed lieutenantgeneral of surinam and sixandthirty islands for this parentage there seems to be some foundation since it was on a voyage to the west indies for the purpose of entering on the duties in question that johnson died in common with the rest of her family aphra settled in surinam where her adventurous career began as though she had not names enoughand most if not all of the variants assigned her were accepted and employed by herself  the appellation astrea bestowed upon her by her admiring contemporaries was advanced by langbaine as her real name it was not until the 6th of september 1884 that the accuracy of the accepted biographies was called seriously into question in the athenaum of that date appeared a letter from mr edmund gosse to whom is due the memoir in the  dictionary of national biography chronicling the discovery in the register of wye in kent of an entry of the baptism on the 10th of july 1640 of ayfara daughter of john johnson a barber and of amy his wife on the strength of this notice mr gosse assumes that the alleged parent was a more distant relative whom she called father if we accept this theory for what it is worth the question is suggested whether the relations between lord willoughby and aphra if parental were necessarily legitimate it is possible that an investigationwere the matter of sufficient importanceof the records of surinam or dutch guiana might throw some light upon it on the cession of surinam to the dutch aphra who had lived at st johns hill the best house in the colonyreturned to london where a few years later she married behn a dutch merchant through whom she is said to have gained admittance at court in 1666 after his death she was sent as a secret agent to the netherlands returning thence when on the point of contracting second nuptials which however fell through owing to the death of her lover she was wrecked losing her entire property and narrowly escaping with her life the secret whioh in the course of her flirtations she had surprised of the intention of the dutch to sail up the thames and burn the english ships in the medway was derided at court her applications for a payment she had well earned were refused she appears to have been lodged in gaol for debt and found herself compelled to seek a living by her pen the tragedies with which she approached the stage were unsuccessful and it was not until she produced comedy after comedy licentious in intrigue and coarse in dialogue but possessed of a certain measure of vivacity and spirit that she won recognition during a literary career which lasted for something under a quarter of a century she acquired the intimacy of dryden killigrew tate otway and the wits of the day and when in 1689 she died owing to the ignorance of her physician she found a restingplace in poets corner westminster abbey where on a slab of marble her name may still be read the irony of fate thus pursued her to the end and the woman whose name not too justly has become a byword in such state doth lie as has been vainly demanded for more than one of the greatest poets of following centuries it was at surinam that aphra made the acquaintance of oroonoko the african prince whose adventures she narrates in the bestknown of her romances how much of the story she tells is fact and how much fiction is as doubtful as are most other things connected with her life and proceedings the novelist was credited by her contemporaries with intimate and dishonouring relations with her hero a gratuitous and wildly improbable suspicion for never surely did an amorous woman depict a successful rival in colours so bright as those bestowed upon imoinda the inspirer of oroonokos passion and the sharer in his fate seven years after mrs benns death the story of oroonoko was dramatised by thomas southerne who afterwards expressed his regret at having coupled so touching a theme with comic scenes of extreme coarseness southernes tragedy was thrice amended or imitated a pale and colourless rendering by dr hawkesworth being lukewarmly defended by jdr johnson from one or other of these dramatisations the popular idea if such can be said to exist of oroonoko is drawn the fable itselfwe leave the reader to accept the word in whichsoever sense it commends itself to himbelongs wholly to mrs behn and to her is due the credit of finding in a fugitive african slave a subject for romance at a period when the choice by shakespeare of a moor as a hero was being seriously rebuked that there is a basis of fact in the story of  oroonoko or the royal slave will not be seriously disputed the narrator claims to have been an eyewitness of the deeds she recounts and asserts  what i could not be witness of i

costume of the sort is characteristic it might be supposed of the aborigines of the island rather than of the african importations with whom they had nothing in common except experience of european treachery cruelty and deceit it is the indians of whom mrs behn speaks rather than africans when she says that such is their respect for truth and ignorance of falsehood that when the english governor who had pledged himself to meet them failed either to come or to send a message they mourned and fasted for the death which alone could as they assumed have caused his absence oroonoko himself is described as a black a perfect ebony or polished jet with eyes  the most awful that could be seen a nose  rising and roman and a mouth firmly shaped and with no signs of the thick lips of the negro his sentimental adventures may be assumed to be in part imaginative but his death in circumstances of revolting cruelty after heading a servile revolt has nothing that offends probability mrs behn is then to be credited with being among the first to denounce the horrors and atrocities of slavery had the whole of her novels been as simple and direct as this story they would have taken a permanent place in literature the more serious of them are however extravagant in action and commonplace in style most of them bear traces of foreignprobably spanishinfluences and some must be accepted as translations those which are of unmistakably home growth are like the comedies of the author more noticeable for licence than for any other quality in the king of bantam which is the most original as well as the most amusing the action is placed in a world such as we meet with in wycherley and the story exhibits the manner in which people represented as perfectly worthy and estimable and of established position plot successfully to extort from a rich and foolish dupe a portion for a deserving but dowerless maiden were anything new to be said concerning the immorality prevalent in restoration times justification for it might be herein found t with the life and writings generally of mrs behn it is superfluous to concern ourselves her plays a further reprint of which would be welcome constitute her chief claim to literary rank a few of her poems have won recognition her  love in fantastic triumph sat is in the best of recent anthologies and one or two other pieces such as her elegiac verses on waller have won recognition mrs benns unsavoury reputation is warranted it is probable however that less would have been heard concerning her delinquencies had scotts story concerning the old lady who borrowed her novels and was shocked with what had once given her pleasure been less widely circulated mr bakers introduction deals with the plays rather than the tales but is adequate the edition of the tales is popular rather than scholarly but we are grateful to messrs routledge for their enterprise in giving us this and other halfforgotten books we do not notice the species of memoir or apology by a devoted female admirer which seems to have accompanied some editions and which little trustworthy as it is has great interest and is principally responsible for the views that subsist as to the novelists life a bibliography of mrs benns writings would have been a welcome addition to the reprint which a facsimile of early titlepages and the like would have brought up to modern requirements mrs behn and ravenscroft like herself a dramatist lived on terms cf literary and domestic intimacy to what extent they collaborated is a matter into which it is now

stripping it as he goes of a little of its romance in the novel rob was all daring and resolve with a spice of generosity in his composition though that rather the effiect of calculated contempt than of the pure impulses of nature and a man who plundered by wholesale and was lavish on the same scale in the story he shows more of the peddling roguebhe dilutes his audacity with a dash of discretionhe is shirking in danger and bullying out of it the prefice one of considerable length embraces the story of the outlawed clan of the gregors the oppressions they suffered and the revenges they took covering large tracts on the highland borders the counties of argyle and perth as the gregors did their neighbours the earls of argyle and breadalbane by their influence with the crown fgot these lands entered in their own charters and took forcible possession as opportunitifs occurred these encroach menta of course the gregors resisted and the resistance was by their powerful enemies replvaented at court as acts of invasion and robbery mary and her son james alike legislated against them in the dracospirit of the times and finally forbade the use of the very name and assembling together of more than four at a time mingling rather than merging in the neighbouring clans they in consequence became drummonds buchan ans campbells c in name but continued gregors still in heart and still unitable for clan purposes in the civil wars they in commonswith other higihanders why should they fight with each other when the war opened lowlanders to plunder they adopted the royal cause and at the restoration had influence enough to get the iniquitous statutes against them repealed but not enough to keep them so their reenactment was speedily smuggled in again but the enemies of the

explanatory introduction is occupied not now in communicating any details as to the origin of the 1 abbot or its object or again in ob viating and defending as was the case with the  monastery but with a statement or suggestion of the motives which on its first appearance prompted a speedier publication than usual the monastery and the abbot were but parts of one subject and of course less time was spent in search of a new story but the authorconsidering the monastery in some respects as a failure though he had no serious alarms of any fatal or permanent effects upon his po pularity thought it good policy to hasten t6 fetch up his leeway not to advance was in some sort to recede and he felt it to be of some importance still to show by a fresh and more successful effort that the failure was rather the effect of an illchosen subject than an illmanaged story he was not as he says in his own happy way one of those like fashionable publishers by the way who are willing to suppose the brains of an author are a kind of milk which will not stand above a single creaming and of course did not despair in sending the abbot forth so soon after the monastery as he did he acted like

in literature there is no need to say that  broken to harness resembles its author in being strong manly and good at heart it ia a first novel and a better work of fiction has not for many a week come under om notice from beginning to end we have read it with lively interest and we lay it aside with an agreeable sense of refreshment and increased strength readers of every class will find in the story a liberal fund of amusement and there are those who on closing the third volume will thank the author for certain wise lessons and many tine pictures taken as a whole it is a mons novel dealing far more with bohemia clubrooms and masculine absurdities than with though refinements and graces of womans life but though it ia a  mans novel women will relish it  for throughout its diverse scenes there is a chivalric and unobtrusive recognition of feminine goodness moreover there is not even in its revelations of bohemia a single line that will raise a blush or jar upon the sensitive ear  broken to harness to what object does the title apply 1 a colt long in leg and big in bone ignorant of the collar and fresh from the marsh now for the first time put in training for roadwork  a luckless hunter that having come to grief in a steeplechase has fallen in mans esteem and is condemned henceforth to draw the van instead of following the hounds  a steed of purest pedigree but by reason of some defect from which stainless descent cannot insure immunity deemed unfit to contend for though honours of the turf a highbred dainty filly sentenced after a brief day of triumph in  the row to run between the shafts of a butchers cart or drag the phaeton of a country parson literally to none of these but figuratively to the last young ladies who dance through the season in the best  sets of may fair may shudder at the bare thought of being broken to harness and may scout the possibility that fortune will require them to put their shoulders to domestic wheels and tug away at cumbrous family coaches that stern lot however awaits the greater number of them  and in mr yatess novel they may read how one of their gentle kind and high degree was after much trouble on the part of her trainer and in spite of her skittish ways and high temper put through the manege and broken to harness the poor girl who is subjected to this indignity is barbara lexden penniless niece of a wicked old aunt whose income and place in the world of fashion make up the list of her virtues barbara has been well introduced and ably chaperoned she has made a hit and achieved rank as a reigning helle  and her aunt expects great things of her barbara herself is not disinclined to play the high game indeed she has set her heart on making a grand matchan ambition by no means rare amongst really beautiful young women who stand at one of lifes gamblingtables staking their wit and beauty against the wealth and rank of richer competitors  offers she had had in plentyyouthful peers with slender incomes middleaged commoners solemn wealthy dull    but barbara refused them all she told her aunt that she was playing for a high stake but instead of playing the game out barbara like many girls who would be selfish and worldly if their better natures would permit them ceases to care about the high stake and turns away from the green cloth with a modest prize instead of marrying a rich peer she becomes the wife of frank churchill a journalist on the staff of a daily newspaper who has no connexion whatever with the world in which barbara is accustomed to move franks father was an unsuccessful artist in poverty frank picked up his education at a country school and a german university  and when he falls in love with barbara he is living with his old mother in great adullam street which as scarcely anybody knows is a street lying between grays inn gardeas and mecklenburg square indeed barbara and frank churchill are separated by so wide a bar of social circumstances that mr yates feels it necessary to explain with much care how it was that they were guests in the same country house such a coincidence of highborn beauty and obscure toil is by no means usual but the author accounts for it satisfactorily and manages his story so well that when barbara throws her grand wicked old aunt over and in spite of protests and expostulations becomes the wife of a poor journalist readers do not feel that she is acting otherwise than naturally and in accordance with everyday experience after the wedding comes the honeymoon after that the flood of tears and regrets it is a gloomy hour for barbara when she makes her first entrance into frank churchills house in great adullam street from which humble unattractive dingy dwelling franks mother has retreated in order that the bride may feel herself mistress of her own house she is in harness  but though she begins to work with a good will her pride rebels and the weariness of her days whilst her husband is working away from home is too much for her powers of endurance of course the distance between grays inn road and park lane cuts her off from her old friends  and she is offended by such society as frank can procure for her the pipesmoking artists jealous authors and noisy bohemians who spend their evenings in his study are not persons to her taste  and she is even less pleased by their illdressed wives and chattering daughters other sources of trouble arise barbara and franks mother pull against each other  and through the malice and idleness of lookerson mutual jealousy springs up between husband and wife at last after many outbreaks of temper on the part of barbara and after a trifling display of injustice and violence on franks part the younga wife flies from great adullam street and seeks shelter in the house of a married lady how she is brought to repent this hasty step  how frank learns to judge her more leniently  how grief and the prickings of conscience bring her humbly to his side  how he acknowledging his own misconduct whilst he pardons hers takes her again to his arms  and how she is at last  broken to harness and runs merrily on thinking herself lucky in having fallen into the hands of a skilful and merciful trainerare matters about which the reader must learn from mr yates himself the ending of the tale does not quite please us frank churchill ought not to have obtained that legacy and commissionership in the tintax office  the fitness of things requires that he should by hard work in his own profession have raised himself to prosperity and power and barbara as mistress of a house in russell square ought to have made the discovery that life in mesopotamia may be and in many cases is quite as happy and gracious and refined as lifo in belgravia but our disappointment in this respect does not make us unjust to mr yates an historian must be truthful and as barbaras husband became a great man and a rich one in official circles and as she saw fit to live in a pretty villa on the banks of the thames what can mr yates do but state that such was the case apart from barbaras troubles the story contains much good matter the sketches of the clublife of authors and artists are capital enough has been said of mr yatess cleverness and power  but we have scarcely done justice to the unaffected amiability and manliness  that are amongst his most agreeable qualities	englishfiction

tale entitled  mount sorel contribht d by this author to nmessrs chiapman ani halls monthly series wve entered at considerable length upon an examination of the peculiar features of his or her genius it will therefore be unnecessary to repeat here the judgement then lronounced and the more so as it has been amply confirmed by public opinion which has received that publication into the catalogue of its favourites e ilia wyndham is not however quite equal to its immediate predecessor although a very able pej formance it was evidently composed with less care because with more haste character is not so minutely elaborated nor are the pictures so perfect the samne labour has not been bestowed in aftercorrection nor has the pen been so fearless in blotting as it is wont to be in the same hands but these defects are comparative only it is when we test the author by his or her own standard that we are compelled to find fault by the side of his contemporaries lie appears to great advantage not inferior to the best of them in his excellencies while his defects are fewer than are to be seen in any this is ligh praise but it is a sincere opinion based not upon a hasty perusal of one only of his vorks but produced by close observation of his literary career from the appearance of the  two old mens tales  to the three volumes now before us when we commenced the critic three years since it was our design to present a skeleton of the plots of the various fictions that might come before us for review but a little experience satisfied us that the plan was one which could not be carried out without great injustice to authors and annoyance to readers so abbreviated a story that might be interesting enough with the lights and shades thrown in at the telling would not unfrequently seem tame and bald in the outline while without satisfying the curiosity of the reader it would take off the edge of appetite for the perusal of the work the end being already revealed to him we have found it to be in practice the most convenient course to indicate only so much of the subject of the fiction as will serve to show the class to which it belongs and to express such a general opinion of its merits as may enable the reader to determine whether it is one which he will buy or borrow emilia wyndham belongs to the class of domestic novels it is intended to portray actual life with of course the usual allowance of a little exaggeration and some improbabilities in the order of events accorded to the novelist as a necessity the style of the work and three of the most striking characters

conclusion that the close of though tah will ilipleifc no enenot even the fusty critic  and this in spite ofthe touch of poetical justice vhioli as we have said some thousand times is essentially unjust  emilia wyndham literature emilia wyndham a paragon of goodnes and beauty loves and is beloved by colonel lennox one of those supercilious specimens of modern chivalry who profess not to know a wood anemone despise a garden terrace tecause it has not an esplanade a thousand feet high breasting the ocean and looks upon all men of business as a class to be avoide the character of emilias father will be best described by an extract  i was promised some grouse for supper tonight and here is only an odious roast fowl t why i am very sorry you should be disappointed mr wyndham was the reply  but when the man asked halfaguinea a brace for them i really felt inclined to be shabby and send him away without his reckoning  every thing one particularly likes is always halfaguinea a brace with women and then turning round  what have you there before you maam sweetbreads hiumph emilia is that an apricot tart no papacherry i think are apricots too madam halfaguinea a halfdozen because i rather expressed a wish for some i think yesterday  this exhibition of domestic fretfulness and tyranny occurs ill the presence of colonel lennox and of mr danby a london solicitor who i ias arrived at the oaks to avert a catastrophe which mr wyndhams thoughtless dissatisfied nature and his habitual extravagance pandered to by a rascally attorney is rapidly bringing about mr danby is described as a thin spare man whose clothes rather hung upon than dressed him and with hair either rusted or grizzled yet a man of superior ablities and deep feelingsfeelings which emilia first called forti from their hidden depths to infuse a new and lifebreathing warmth into that heart which before was as dry as the parchment upon which he endorsed his conveyances emilia has a bosom friend lisa hesketh daughter of sir thomas and lady maria she is petite exquisitely beautiful and undisciplined  the most beautiful heap of elegant and softlooking things and the sweetest little face among them all that could well be imagined an extract from one of lisa hieskeths characteristic letters to emilia will convey the best idea of her disposition it is written on the occasion of her fathers appointment as amassador to the court of st petersburg  oh ill make mischief among them all at st petersburgsee if i dontand ill marry some grand russian princeprince ruffanutffapuffaslowsky dont you see the princess coming walking up to you in a grand london partyyoull only be poor little mrs colonel len   dont beat mehanging on your husbands arm with may be a paltry bit of a red ribbon just rping at his buttonhole and a paltry sir as a handle to his name an shall come up to you with my graindcc emilia wyndham by the author of  two old mens tales  mount bo0rel c 3 vol henry colburn all sorts of sheepskins and twonecked eagles and dragons and georges and michaels and monster adorning his breast and covered from head to foot with stars and garters and youll look so humble and so afraid and i shall be so sweetly condescending it will scarcely be anticipated after these juvenile confidences that isa hesketfl weds colonel lennox and the good and beautiful emilia is married to the man of red tapes and rusty black suit yet such events are quickly brought about by the ruin and sickness of mr wyndham the death of his lady and the selfishness and harshness of au uncle colonel lennox has joined his regiment without explaining himselfit was too much trouble to do soand to procure a shelter for her father sunk under misfortune to a fretful drivelling lunatic and a home for herself emilia at length accepts that offered to her in chancerylane while leniox on his return from the peninsula disgusted with what he considers to be her want of faith marries the pretty but thoughtless lisa unlike most novels of which matrimony is the climax in the present instance it is only the steppingstone to the mature development of the characters we have so slighty sketched the friends although moving in such different spheres of life continue faithful to one another  while as might be expected the illassorted unions they have made areproductive at first of any thing but happiness lisa s want of character and principle conduct her to the very verge of guilt but emilia resolved to save her toils in her career of love and goodness with unequalled nobleness and depth of purpose an lago of a mother unfortunately rouses distrust and jealousy during these proceedings in mr danby s bosom and his life is a life of doubt and misery till one great catastrophe averted in timean elopement prevented by emiliaplaces all parties in their proper light and restores husbands and wives to love and duty it is difficult to imagne any thing better told or more carefully and skilfully wrought out tan this wedded relationship of mr danby and emilia wyndham and we are fully prepared to agree with the author that it was much better that these pairs once united should have remained united and have learned to love one another than that they should have changed partners and found mutual failings and mutual discontent and fresh reason for changing again in every new form of married life they might have tried  lisa hesketh an emilia wyndham are characters modelled by no extraordinary coincidence upon the same plan as eveleen and her better principled sister in 1 the confessions of a pretty woman lisas mother s like eveleens mother a dressy vain coquette violenttempered mother whom she could neither love nor respect but the development of the characters is managed with superior skil told with infinitely more power and wrought out without a blemish in the important points of taste and feeling there is actually nothing to mar an admirable picture of manners and a very striking story of everyday fashionable life there is no aristocratic slang no violation of decency no forced hotbed sentimentality every thing is natural and well told there are passages that speak worlds as to the sex of the author as  man is born bred reared dyed double dyed in jealousyit is the universal passion and again 4if husbands now and then received a lesson in their turn and learned to correct themselves as well as their wives and still more so in a sentence the only one we should perhaps have wished to have seen oniitted  there is something in woman that seems born for the knapsack that every virtue has its attendant vice is as thus placed a sophism every sentiment inay be in excess or in deficiency hence it is that extravagance may accompany generosity or covetousness economy it is the abuse not the use that is vicious and hence the practice of virtues without their attendant vices is not only as the author puts it rare excellent and beautiful but it is essential to the healthy performance of the moral and intellectual functions and is the standard of perfection in the natural constitution of man here is an observation highly creditable to a female pen  a passion for naturea deep imaginative passion for her wild scenes and so ary beauty very often lies hidden under the rough coat of the fisherman the velveteen shootingjacket and even under the scarlet coat though the scarlet coat has more of the show and vanity of life in it and is often though not always the covering for that vulgar and most unpoetic feeling the love of fashionthe same may be said of the battue   in such employments wholesome healthy tastes and many sound and manly virtues are exercised naturewild beautiful romantic naturenever speaks to the human heart altogether in vain there is a world of charity in these observations which are worthy of the author of  the natural history of enthusiasm and we see the same correct feeling slily coming to the surface in two other sentences people who live in such little dark ugly rooms have not even a right to esteem themselves happy happiness is the right as well as the attribute only of those who are clothed in purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day but we must quit this delightful novel leaving it toits own merits to recommend it to a host of admirers every lady should read it  the literary examiner extiliav wpdaam

healthy colouring the exquisite unaffectedness of art which we so admired in mow sorel are her with a purer style in the writing and an eaier flow in the story telling ehilia wyndham is a masterpiece the characters are few the incidents those of every day and the philosophy homely enough the book has no lofty igts but we can never cease to know the people in it or to be better for having known them their tale is of suffering and trial surmounted by duty and affection it deals with the extremes of passion and of selfcontrol and a healthy oldworld wisdom most quaintly interspersed throws rich fragrance into it the teller of the story comes in between its intemperate beats its desperate follies its hard endurances and its loving mistakes like the good friar in the tragedy of veroina with his elegant sermon and his basket of flowers it is not a tragedy as we have said but there is hardly a page that does not tremble with tureatened disasters or that does not on the other hand in some chance thought still comfort and reassure the imagination we have been powerfully affected by this tale but what moves the heart thus betters it also and there is much beyond the amusement of a passing hour in such a book as emilia iv ndham the mere story is 8s slight anddependingso much on the subtler developments of feeling and character that a bare outline would do it no sort of justice but it turns upon the lifestruggle of a highminded devoted girl whose noble performance of what she sees to be her duty conducts her at last through the roughest and most unpromising paths through the sternest and saddest sacrifices through the most 	
ffecting patience and selfdenial to a solid and sacred happiness the germ of this idea is common enough but we question if it has ever been unfolded into such sweetness or adorned with so much of that inestimable wisdom which belongs to the common and daily trials and to the needful mutual forbearances of hearth and home the heroine is introduced in this brief description it harmonises very quietly but beautifully with the after current of the tale b milia had not regular features but no one could deny that she was a very fine girl full of health and animation with two very expressive eyes of whatever colouryou please to call them for no one could ever decide the mattera sweet delicate mouth expressive of both sense lemper and feelinga nice steady routed chinabundance of brown haira colour like a rosea light elatic but somewhat fullformed figure with a pair of the moot beauful arms in the world which last advantage gave a singular elegance to ber gestures however when you were with her or talking to her you seemed as little to think of what she looked like as she did herself early in the book she is driven to a marriage of duty not affection and mr danby is a hero fit to pair off with such a heroine he is nothing more nor less than a london attorney wealthy and intelligent but awkward in his manners limited in his social experiences and a slave to his busioes habits a dry laborious diffident recluse but with a noble heart lying under the crust of his strange life and this is awakened suddenly by the sig of emilia wyodham to this chacry lain cymos she plays the iphigeaia she im at first a star and dwells apart but misery makes his world hers and she descends to him and calls to him in her distress perhaps we may give the short scene in which the hopes visio

marriott has yet writtenone is almost irresistibly attracted to the question of the relative potential effects of i energy and 2 mass upon the momentum and the staying power of a novel in handling this themewhich deals with the effect upon her own and a few other lives of t wifes rebellion and desertion of her husbandmr marriott is lavish of energy devoting it to a resolute concentration upon the matter in hand to the exclusion of almost everything else and bringing his tale to a conclusion sufficiently complete in some three hundred octavo pages of fairly large print that is to say it occupies about half the space of mr henry james  the golden bowl a book the very mention of which almost provokes a study in contrasts in how leisurely a manner does the prince in that tale saunter on to the stage that is unobtrusively but carefully prepared for him how deliberately he stops before a bond street window strolls on again eventually pays a cali all the time it is true the author is revealing him letting him reveal himself turning light upon a facet here and there but all so quietly with such an air almost of abstraction that though you cannot miss the fact that you are in the very midst of the stress of life you may easily miss the perception of the moments which are dominating great issues in comparison with all this the sudden appearance in mr marriotts opening page of sherring and umney before the door of 29 sidney gardens in hot pursuit of dick feddon has almost the effect of the entry of puppets so vigorously do they proceed to take up their allotted parts and discover their characteristics not that mr marriotts writing is really spasmodic or even hurried if his puppets are highly geared they are thoroughly well oiled he merely has them trained to the highest degree of efficiency they gallop as it were like horse artillery fully equipped into action each character bringing his motives views of life and estimate of the situation to bear upon the tale at long or short range as the case may be tnere is no doubt that at first such a method carries all before it the rapid introduction to a succession of active intellects all busily employed stimulates the reader and rivets his attention so that he cares little to discover the showman working the wires though more than a glimpse of himself his wit and his prejudices is to be had for the looking but upon a second perusal when all the plot is known do not all these various clever mental anatomiesstand out a little bare to the view  compare all the colloquies between evelyn alemere sweet light and alluringand the boy she is tricking compare again the sarcastic collofuies between feddons mother and her advisers with all those wonderful interwoven subtly significant conversations in mr james book it will be seen that while the younger writer brings a widening knowledge of life to bear upon his story the elder allows his story to flow broadly through a wide knowledge of life and so brings his readers before broad and spacious horizons to the contemplation of which they may return again and again it would of course be as absurd to criticise mr marriott for what he does not attempt to do as to suggest that any long novel is likely to be better than any short one moreover we cordially admire such choice effective brevity as that which can so movingly put the whole tragedy of archdales life upon a single page yet we think that if a man have the stuff in him  mass  makes for permanence and we believe too that were mr marriott to give himself more room he would lose a certain occasional air of halfveiled rancour towards his meaner personages which is not the most admirable of many admirable qualities  mrs alemeres elopement by charles marriott jnashj mr marriott has gone far in  mrs alemeres elopement towards the fulfilment of the high expectations raised by his former novels his style is less laboured his manner of narration stronger his touch in characterdrawing more sure what is not so welcome is the cynicism that pervades the book evelyn alemere beautiful refined and passionate leaves her husbands roof with richard feddon a young musician with something of the knightly temperament who is as certain of her purity as her loveliness there is nothing in their relations to disturb his idealistic admiration of her but she induces him to allow the divorce proceedings brought by her husband to go undefended and secretly marries a former lover immediately she is free mrs alemere is a very clever and interesting study though here and there it is somewhat marred by a lack of consistency that this sirenlike creature should be treated in a cynical mood is not unnatural but unfortunately there is scarcely one character in the book that is drawn sympathetically mrs feddon who looks with haughty disapproval upon the escapades of her quixotic son is made to cut an undignified figure in a particularly cruel scene and rose archdale the only woman in the story who has escaped the contempt of the author is rather too cold and reserved to be really attractive mr marriotts male creations do not fare much better at his hands than do

learn greek in the same way she read eagerly every work on philosophy science or history that came within her reach when she was twenty the first two books of montaignes essays appeared and she drank in their wit till she was fairly intoxicated in 1588 by good chance her mother took her from her native picardy to paris where montaigne was also lodging the eccentric maiden aged twentythree and by thirtytwo years his junior sent him word that she reverenced him and longed to be his friend not too famous to despise her humble praise be called upon her next day and at once to her great delight offered her the alliance and affection of a father to a daughter it was an odd relationship preserved during the four remaining years of montaignes life he left her an orphan when she was twentyseven and she lived to the age of eighty editing his works writing treatises in support of his teaching in proof of her own favourite dogma of the intellectual and moral equality between men and women she gained every year in popularity and eccentricity and in her old age devoted herself to the polite excesses of the pricieuses her earliest and only noteworthy book was the novel  le promenoir de i montaigne so called because she rehearsed it to her  adopted father while walking in his garden it is a tedious story of a persian princess betrothed to the king of parthia but who loves and is loved by a grecian youth their troubles her constancy and his treachery are detailed in full up to the moment when she procures her own murder and he stabs himself that he may fall into her grave from that starting point arose the french novel the first specimen was stiff and wearisome loaded with classical allusions and almost destitute of pathos or any sort of human sentiment hardly better though more famous was durfes  astrie begun twenty years later in 1610 and finished in 1825 it was an endless story of pastoral love and sorrow imitated from the italian novelists both works are to be remembered rather because of their influence upon those which came after than for any merit of their own the first woman of genius to be influenced was iadile de scudery like marie de gournay she was poor and selftaught besides gaining a marvellous intimacy with classical lore she learned dancing painting and music and to those attainments she added skill in agriculture cookery and medicine she took to authorship as a means of living and in hope of paying off some of the family debts and soon she became rish and famous few women have been more reverenced by their contemporaries and more neglected by posterity but who save miss kavanagh can have courage to read a novel in ten octavo volumes with thirteen hundred pages a piece professing to be all about ancient history but with its characters places and events made to fit the characters places and events of the writers day such was her igrand cyrus with louis the fourteenth for its cyrus and with praise or blame of every one she knew scattered through the work shorter than the  grand cyrus for it occupied only seven thousand pagesbut more wearisome in every other respect was the roman story of i clelie still shorter and in every way better was i ibrahim a turkish romance which preceded the classical and more ambitious novels it is true that madlie de scudirys works abound with pleasant episodes and are rich in delicate sentiment it may even be true as mis kavanagh says that she did more than any other writer of fiction to make the men of her country courteous and gentle and its women intellectual and refined but in her exaggeration of the bad models set before her she made her books unreadable to every generation after her own  if i were to invent a story said one of her heroines  i would make things much more perfect than they are all the women should be beautiful all the men as valiant as hector every one of my heroes killing at least a hundred men in every battle i would build palaces of precious stones every instant i would have prodigies and shipwrecks and conflagrations of cities and a thousand other things which give rise to fine lamentations and beautiful decriptions tnfinitly bettr wer maam dl

mtless warrios and mlaies with impouuible charms madame de la fayette peopled her tales with simple men and women and appealed to the living sympathies of her readers as the founder of a new sotle of fiction she fell into many errors and the life of her y was not true enough to make any copy of it highly attractive but boileau was right in setting her before evez other authoress in france of her heroines she heres was in great measure the type she was born in 1683 so that her life of sixty years was overlapped on both sides by the ninetyfour which madle de scudry needed for the writing of her

madame de suvignd4 the friend whom on her deathbed she acknowledged to have loved most in the worldwrote of her she is tired of saying good morning and  good evening she has fever every day and rest cures her but for all that she had seasons when it was pleasure to meet with a few chosen friends and when it was relief to write a few touching stories in them she seems to have spoken her own grief she had been married in youth to a husband who slighted her and when she was oldat thirtytwo she called herself quite oldshe became the friend of la rochefoucauld now a penitent prodigal why she questioned had they not ben friends before what might not their two lives have been could they have been blended into one her best years were spent in painfully gathering up the fragments of the happiness which she thought should have been he and to la rochefoucauld she came like a good angel to one dared to think ill of such a friendship as theirs nothing wrote madame de s6vign6  could be compared to it it was broken in 1680 when la roohefoucauld died madame do la fayette survived him thisteen years those years being largely spent in converse with the portroyalist teachers with whom she had been oft at heart all through her life that tale repeated and expanded in its heroines fictions in spite of its bad french sentiment is not without some grace very different but quite as necessary to be noted by the literary student is the life fof madame or madlle de tenein also reproduced in her writings a nun perforce and living in a dissolute age them may be some excuse for her dismal misuse of the wit and beauty with which she was endowed but her sins were too great to be forgiven the mother of dalembert the foundling was also the parent of what is emphaticly known as the

wrote novels are chosen by miss kavanagh as fair representatives of female work in english literature just as ten french novelists are made to illustrate the actions of women upon french literature in the work of which the supplement is now before us in a couple of volumes entitled enqjlish women of letters it is certainly curious to find aphra behn spoken of only as a novelist lady mary wortley montague not once mentioned and equal neglect shown to a crowd of other authoresses who if none of them hold a very prominent rank in the history of english literature are as worthy of notice in connexion with the subjects that they handled as are our female novelists in the literature of fiction as far as she goes however miss kava nagh is always interesting and fairly accurate the authoresses whom she describes serve well enough to show how far for the last two centuries and more women have contributed to the formation of the modern novel in english literature but they have been much lems influential even in that way than she imagines few will think with miss kavanagh that if swift and defoe were not novelists aphra behn is to be considered a writer of novels in  robinson crusoe and i gullivers travels there is infinitely more play of imagination variety of incident and real appreciation of humad character than in  oroonoko the history of the novel strictly so called begins with the man richardson and the man fielding but long before their time there were written romances similar to the  grand cyrus and other french works of the school of the precziuses according to forms popular in england from the date of sir philip sidneys  arcadia imitated and borrowed from by numberless authors and authoresses who made up for a paucity of human interest by distributing their eloquence over a larger space  oroonoko was better than these in that it gave a picture of real life but it is rather to be called a historical narrative adorned with fictitious details than a novel its authoress the daughter of a mr johnson of canterbury started for surinam with the rest of the family upon his being appointed lieutenantgeneral of the colony ihe died at sea but the widow and children completed the voyage and spent many years in the tropical home prepared for them after which aphra johnson  a handsome dark girl with a clear forehead fine eyes a full and merry mouth an animated though voluptuous coun3 tenance and a quick and ready tongue as miss kavanagh describes herreturned to be the pet of king a charles the second she amused him by an account of e surinam and obeyed his orders in writing out at length 1 the tragic history of its hero prince oroonoko the tale  is in keeping with nearly everything else that was written  to entertain the dissolute court but it also abounds in true ivigorous descriptions of nature in its most luxuriant and i picturesque aspect and has not a few rough vivid sketches i of character with all its faults it is entitled to a higher 1 place in the history of fiction than is commonly assigned i t it la aphra behn died in 1689 and sarah fielding was born d in 1714 oroonoko was published about 1665 and la david simple in 1744 between them appeared no twomans novel or novelist worth recording but the interval e was marked by important changes in the style and subject  of fictitious writing swift and defoe showed how keenly is the foibles and vices of mankind might be attacked by dsatire disguised in fiction and the portrait of sir itogger do re coverley is an admirable illustration of the character drawing which addison and steele did much to introduce 6 murray into english fiction richardson in 1741 wrote  pamela which with all its faults was a great advance upon  the pomp and parade of romancewriting from which it was written to warn young people and in 1742 fielding ridiculed the affectations into which also richardson himself had fallen and raised the true novelist to the level of the poet by his  joseph andrews fieldings sister writing g david simple two years later attempted to blend something of her brothers style with the mode of writing borrowed by le sage from the spanish novelists and thus to inculcate a morality foreign to the purpose of either her heroesfor nearly all the personages of the book are as much heroes as the one who gives it its name and equal care is taken in the delineation of all whether great or littleare as complete embodiments of virtues and vices as the characters in  pilgrims progress or the earlier works on which bunyan built his wonderful tale her merit lay as fielding said of her without exaggeration in a vast penetration into human nature a deep and profound discernment of all the mazes windings and labyrinths which perplex the heart of man to such a degree that he is himself often incapable of seeing through them david simple is a book that has dropped only by public oversight out of the high place due to it in the history of english fiction madame darblay however was for popularity and in respect of all small matters though utterly inferior in the highest forms of power a better novelist than sarah fielding miss kavanagh is right in regarding her as in some sort the mademoiselle de scudery of english literature in execution there is entire difference between  evelina and the  grand cyrus but their effects were similar each authoress strove diligently and skilfully to be clever and to make the novel not so much a means of moral teaching as a series of moral sketches from real life madame darblay drew her inspiration from fielding and emulated as far as she could his art of painting the world as it is but with true womanly instinct she chose only virtuous themes she liked to be humorous and satirical she had a keen sense of the ludicrous and took a pleasure in showing up the vulgarity coarseness insolence and pride of the men and women whom she saw around her but she was steadfast and unsparing in her denunciation of vice she showed her wisdom in painting only those parts of society that were well known to herself and miss kavanagh hardly exceeds the truth in saying that dno one has left us pictures so complete no one has drawn so distinctly classes of fashionable society of which all record has vanished save such as is to be found in her pages during her long life of eightytwo years she wrote but four novels and each consists of wonderfully minute sketches of external life of manners rather than character strung together with equal conscientiousness though with various artistic success her successor though dying seventeen years earlier was mrs radcliffe a novelist of a very different sort a woman of far more agreeable temperament gentle domestic and kindhearted to an unusual degree mrs radcliffe wrote tales that must have painfully shocked the authoress of cecilia and evelina born in 1764 and very scantily educated she was the daughter of a shopkeeper and at the age of twentythree she married the proprietor and editor of the english chronicle her husband soon found that besides personal beauty and wifely worth she had intellectual powers of a rare order he therefore urge4 her to write and after many refusals on the plea of inability she began to occupy the dull evenings during which his work took him from her with the production of a story soon her peculiar art attained such perfection that even her husband dared not read some of the chapters alone in the night time the tales were altogether unreal fashioned on the model of horace walpoles castle of otranto and vlara reeves  old english baron and of a sort that justified colmans ridicule a novel now is nothing more than an old castle and a creaking door a distant hovel clanking of chainsa gallerya lightold armourand a phantom all in white and thered a novel but in mrs radcliffes case under all the absurdities of horror there was a strange vein of sweetness as well as a marvellous aptitude in the description of both natural and architectural beauty thus she could write to the minds eye when sketching a church of which one window more perfect than the rest opened upon a long vista of the forebt through which was seen the rich colouring of evening melting by imperceptible gra dations into the solemn grey of upper air dark hills whose outline appeared distinct upon the vivid glow of the horizon closed the perspective several of the pillars which had once supported the roof remained the proud effigies of sinking greatness and seemed to nod at every murmur of the blast over the fragments of those that had fallen a little before them and mrs lladcliffe even when painting scenes that she had never visited was as accurate as she was graceful speaking of venice she described  its terraces crowned with airy yet i majestic fabrics touched as they now were with the splendour of the setting sun appearing as if they had been called up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter rather than reared by mortal hands  and the image was so true that byron writing on the spot felt it or stole it i stood in venice on the bridge of sighr a prison and a palace on each hand from out the waves i aw her structures rise as at the stroke of an enchanters wand in the course of eight years mrs radcliffe wrote her five novels they earned as much fame and money as she needed and she spent twentysix happy years of retirement from nearly all company save that of her husband the newspapers and biographical dictionaries announced her death in 1809 while by many it was reported that the exuberance of her own wild fancies had driven her mad and reference was made to the lunatic asylum in which she was supposed to have been confined she did not take the trouble to contradict either statement and lived on till the year 1823 mrs inchbald miss edgeworth min austin mr opie and lady morgan are the novelists of the present oentury portrayed by miss kavanagb most personal interest attaches to mrs inchbald the farmers daughter whom a strange eagerness to see the great world forced to run away from home and become an actress in spite of an impediment in her speech the friend of mrs siddons in the years when she was a washerwoman in the daytime and a tragic queen at night the successful playwriter who lived on eight shillings a week that thankless relatives might be supported and the widow of twentysix whom young men afterwards courted when she was twice as old as themselves but unquestionably the greatest of female novelists of england dead or living was miss austin of whom sir walter scott with characteristic generosity and in fair criticism wrote after reading  pride and prejudice for the third time that young lady had a talent for describing the involvement of feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful thing i ever met with the big bowwow strain i can myself do like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early  english women ofletters biographical sketches by julia kavanagh 2 vols hurst  blackett in her preface miss kavanagh says that this work on the english women of letters is the completion of the literary purpose she had in view when she wrote the  french women of letters the object being to show iioav far during the last two centuries and more women have contributed to the formation of the modern novel in the two great literatures of modern times the french and english she has only taken women who have founded a school of fiction and whose works have produced imitators typical avomen who have been the first in their own style the work comprises a biography of each authoress and an account and analysis of her principal novels tothis task miss kavanagh has brought knowledge of her subject delicacy of discrimination industry and a genial humour which makes her sketches pleasant to read miss kavanagh is too much occupied with her heroines to think about herself and this is the charm of her book it is talking over favourite books with a pleasant sympathising friend who whilst entering into the various characteristics and giving her own opinion very distinctly has yet the skill to avoid a dogmatic tone and all assumption of superiority she thoroughly sympathises with her authors and enters into the intention of their works with a clearness of understanding which is the greatest satisfaction an author can receive from a reader the  english women of letters comprises the lives and works of ten authoresses all avomen of renown in their day and generation the fashion of this world passes away alike in works of fiction as in all other respects works that delighted our grandmothers weary or scandalise their descendants who have their own avay of amusing themselves as they have of fashioning their clothes and dressing their hair if truth and nature will always endure they must take new aspects and combinations the great names in fiction dealt with in this book have already faded into the distance of tradition to be like miss austen to be like mrs radcliffe  or miss edgeworth is always a form of praise but there are many readers who have never found time to read their works for such these disquisitions will have a charm it is like having a story told with the warmth and vividness of the narrators personal interest in it instead of reading it aloud nothing is more fascinating than to make a friend acquainted with a favourite story or author and miss kavanagh excels in giving the pith and spirit of a story heraccount of all the novels she touches upon is as pleasant reading as anything ave haare met with for some time the first novelwriter on the list is no other than mrs aphra behn whose plays and novels at one time enjoyed great vogue and were capable of rousing remonstrance from the not too susceptible public of charles the seconds time what miss kavanagh had to do in that galley ave do not know and we think she had much better have left it alone from the testimony of responsible people it is known that mrs benns works dealt with things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme  that she passed permission in freedom of speech even in days of licence her mind says miss kavanagh  was tainted to the very core she loved grossness for its own sake because it was congenial to her she wrote dramas which though no worse than those of her contemporaries revolted the public as proceeding from a avoman the disgrace of aphra behn and of her pupils is that instead of raising man to womans moral standard they sank avoman to the level of mans coarseness the very men felt thislove of pleasure miss kavanagh owns to have been her master passion her second was love of literature after making these admissions miss kavanagh enters upon a warm defence of mrs aphra benns virtue  as if when a woman has allowed her thoughts to revel in profligacyher imagination to go upon the streets it signified to herself or anyone else whether she went there in person miss kavanagh gives a life of mrs behn an account of her novel of orinooko together with some descriptions of tropical scenery miss kavanagh claims for orinooko recognition as one of the first great works of english fictionone marking the dawn of that great english school of passion and nature of dramatic and pathetic incident which though last arisen and slowly developed has borrowed least and taught most it is true that for force and freshness the passages quoted are very remarkable and the story of orinooko as given by miss kavanagh beats  uncle tom out of the field for tragic interest and true pathos  but miss kavanagh would have done better to leave both novel and author where she found them in the mausoleum of the british museum aphra behn wasted her genius and profaned her gifts and men are perfectly willing that her name should die miss kavanagh revives the names of several other authors of repute in their day though the echo of the praises that followed them have become as silent as the acclamations of an old roman triumph sarah fielding the friend of richardson the sister of him who wrote  tom jones was highly thought of in her day and her novel of  david simple received praise from quarters that made it seem like fame it is a strictly moral story and is the beginning of those novels in which character is everything and incident is only used to develop characterwhere the human heart is probed in all its depths and followed in all its windings  david simple is however by miss kavanaghs own admission an extremely dull story and except as a literary curiosity lias no value or interest madame darblay and her novels are more talked of than read  so that miss kavanaghs account of her works may have the charm of novelty who has read mrs charlotte smiths old manor house heremmeline her ethelindaand yet all these made a sensation in their day like jane eyre and adam bede and she is the earliest representative of the modern domestic novel the chapters on mrs radcliffe and her novels are the best the criticism is just and the very best of the stories are given with a spirit and enthusiasm which will probably put some readers upon the endeavour to read the originals  an undertaking that needs the wild freshness of morning to enjoy the second volume comprises mrs inchbald to whose life we think miss kavanagh does not render justice  it is told in a hard halfdepreciatory style  but the account of the simple story is excellent for mrs inchbald miss kavanagh claims the great merit of being the first to substitute the essentially original imperfect and yet deeply interesting characters for the old conventional hero and heroine miss edgeworth and mrs opie follow as types of their own respective styles we endorse her high praise of miss edgeworth  but mrs opie with her fade and feeble sentimentality would be unendurable to modern readers miss austen is miss kavanaghs idol and ideal of excellence  she does justice to the others but mis austen she loves of miss austen she tells nothing new indeed the lamentable destruction of all her letters papers and journals by the stupid relative into whose hands they fell has swept away all private aud personal records of this woman so essentially a type of an english woman in the chapter on lady morgan miss kavanagh has been unfortunate amongst the many statements she makes hardly one is correct lady morgan used to complain of the various biographies that avere written of her by persons utterly ignorant about her miss kavanagh repeats the fiction that lady morgan was educated by a miss crowe a milliner as well as a teacher of youth lady morgan was 	
ery angry when that assertion first went out to the world for in fact her schooling was of the very best neither was her mother an actress but a avoman who held plays in detestation and was also a member of lady huntingdons connexion neither was lady morgan herself ever on the stage neither is the history of lady morgans father told according to facts he was never subagent and landsteavard to sir john broavne nor to any one else in short the avhole life is a tissue of mistakes better is the estimate of her stories though miss kavanagh criticises more and narrates less than in the other chapters where she treats of the works of her authors she has not the grasp of lady morgans mind and genius which was too quick and high and glancing to be seized and fastened with a critical corkingpin on the whole this work of miss kavanaghs will be a pleasant contribution to the literature of the times and in raising a shrine to the merits of some of the leading english women of literature miss kavanagh has also associated her own name with theirs	lishfiction

threevolume novels and no one can complain that in making an investment in thc young stepmother they have not got their moneys worth of paper for their money it would fill up a month of wet days in a country house it is impossible not to become to a certain degree interested in the detail of the daily life of the luckless young stepmother and yet it is real hard work to follow her through thc minute history of every day and almost of every hour of the day in her dreary uphill task of humanising her stepchildren and taming and softening their melancholy morose father albinias is a fine charactercourageous impetuous full of life and spirit with a restless craving for  work and an unlimited supply of energy and goodnature full of ardour for  something to do she leaves her bright and happy home in her brothers parsonage where she is adored both by himself and his merry little irish wife for the sake of consoling an inconsolable elderly widower in weak health of a gloomy temperament residing in a damp dark unwholesome house in a dull country town and possessing three of the most odious children it has ever been our fate to meet with either in a book or in real life at first albinia looks forward with hope and resolution to her future fate she intends to cure her husband of giving vent to suppressed sighs and speaking in a voice of subdued melancholy she makes up her mind that she  could bear to have his late wifes memory first with him and she kuows she  could not compensate to him for his loss but trusts that in time he may appear a little less dejected she vainly tries to coax the sulky schoolboy with a toothache into goodhumour to put sense into the foolish affected gossipping lucy even hopes in time to make something out of the languid sickly sophia with her downcast looks and forbidding manner nothing can be more un promising than her commencement though gilbert takes a fancy to her and soon becomes quite  her pet he is weak untruthful and fond of low company lucy gossips away right and left makes mischief between albinia and the meadowses mother and sister of the first mrs kendal and spreads reports of her stepmothers sayings and doings all over bayford as for sophy she baffles all attempts at sociability and till in the course of a year or two she half kills albinias baby and nearly breaks her own neck she remains as perverse and moody as before worried and dispirited mr kendal gives happiness up as a bad job and retires to his study where he locks his door upon all intrudershis young wife includedand takes heed of nought that passes in his uncongenial household out of doors things are very little better the town is dirty and fevers abound the pond exhales thick poisonous vapours the neighbours are secondrate and meddlesome the meadows family interfering and censorious and the children aggravating after her first confinement poor albinia completely breaks down in health and spirits and her brother and sisterinlaw come to her assistance they keep her quiet rouse mr kendal get gilbert sent off to a private tutors and take lucy away with them on a visit winifred takes the opportunity of telling sophy in very plain terms what she thinks of her conduct and maurice fills up the obnoxious pond and from that hour matters improve with the young stepmother then the elderly miss meadows marries a former lover of the days of her youth and the old lady is imported into the house at willow banka great infliction in itself but a blessing inasmuch as she deprives mr kendal of his beloved study and thereby obliges him to consort more with the rest of the family backed up by her brother and mr dusantoy thc excellent clergyman of bayford albinia next induces her husband to take a little interest in public affairs and he becomes in time a churchwarden a magistrate and a useful man of business in the parish the stepchildren gradually grow up and cause much anguish and tribulation of mind to poor mr kendal by falling iu love with all the wrong people lucy makes what is called a good marriage and is wedded to a rich man and a conceited fool in spite of the indignant remonstrances and tearful entreaties of albinia gilbert becomes enamoured of a fascinating french teacher who wins the hearts of all the young men within her reach and is really a charming little thing and deservedly beloved by everybody in the book poor ugly morbid sophy forms an attachment to a rollicking young irishman but ulick omoore has the good taste to prefer genevieve and sophy finds out she has chosen the human and left the divine and makes up her mind to be a very hardworking old maid and takes to albinias children and makes herself generally useful in the world of course poor mrs kendal takes blame to herself for everything that goe3 wrong and her feelings of remorse at every slight contretemps are bitter and exaggerated her brother endeavours to persuade her that although she may have made a few blunders here and there still take it all in all she has faithfully and earnestly done her best and the result lies in other hands than her own this is we presume the moral of the book but we have our doubts whether these kind of books good and useful as they doubtless are in many ways for young ladies who are not allowed to peruse regular novels may not tend to encourage in others too close a scrutiny into the various shades of their own and their neighbours characters each little failing merit tendency or habit is here examined under a powerful microscopic lens and analysed and commented on till one becomes fairly confused as to the relative degrees of right and wrong and if the plan be acted upon and carried out in real life the process can scarcely be a wholesome one to a young mind the young stepmother is

B1574	"['9214080', '6766486', '6761095']"	  the kin ff with two faces new novels by m e cole ridge arnold miss coleridge has written a clever and in many respects interesting novel dealing with sweden and with paris in the early days of the french revolution the most attractive part of the book is that which deals with count fersen whose family name is referred to in dialogue as having been macpherson and his brave attempt to rescue the french king and marie antoinette the least attractive element is the curiously staccato style which the writer adopts it must be admitted that the mannerism is consistent throughout and that it is often used with good effect we notice that miss coleridge expresses obligation to mr nisbet bains  gustav iii and his contemporaries her story which is long and substantial deserves a high place among the class of fiction to which it is allied  the king with two faces by m e coleridge a breathless romance in the style of dumas by the author of the seven sleepers of ephesus  four horses saddled and bridled stood ready this note of haste and emergency is well kept up pageants glow and pistol shots flash through these pages and melodrama is exhausted we gather however that the story is founded on facts in mr nisbet bains gustav iii and his contemporaries edward arnold 421 pp 6s  the king with two faces by m e coleridge arnold the keynote of this thoughtful and finely written story is struck firmly in the first chapter and it isaction hardly a page passes without its momentous event or its deed of derringdo the king is gustav id of sweden the two faces the opposing tendencies towards democracy and absolutism that existed together in this strange inconsistent lovable man from this inner conflict spring the outer conflicts that fill the book to this its pathos of despairing ideals and loyal infidelities is due the climax of the narrative is in the last two years of gustavs reign 17889 when he who had faithfully accepted the popular constitution of 1772 came to bid it defiance and as a result ended his life by assassination gustav overshadows the book but the immediate hero is count adolf ridding a courtier devoted heart and soul to the twofold service of king and country no service or feat of daring is too hard for adolf if called upon by gustav for sweden and the ruin of his faith in his master is the more tragic when gothenburg was besieged by the danes and on the point of surrender it was adolf who volunteered at the risk of his life to blow up the bridge and so keep out the imminent danger he wins the kings gratitude  nevertheless his sweetheart tala is coveted by baron essen and as the price of essens support to the royal cause adolf is sent to practical banishment at pans here he comes under the influence of mme de stael and tala hearing slanderous reports of his relations with that lady marries the rival suitor after the ignominious flight of louis xvi and marie antoinette to versailles adolf returns to sweden he finds gustav on the path of despotism and the people ripe for revolt sick and sore at heart he becomes implicated m a plot to kill the king at a masquerade and in this attempt the interest of the novel culminates the king is wounded and adolf who still loves him hides in the sickchamber to behold him once more here he is witness of an interview between gustav and his brother the duke of sudermania in which the king demands pardon for the rebels the scene is effectively told and we quote it as a favourable example of miss coleridges manner   i could promise he said at last low and unwillingly  for all but one you would not have the murderer set free to slay the son as he has slain the father p the king seemed to reflect a moment it was the thin strange voice that spoke again now in utter weariness and exhaustion  for all the rest you promisebefore god   for all the rest i promise repeated the duke as if the words were dragged out of him before god 4 before god adolf was fiercely torn in two had he stood in the dukes place he must have yieldedhe knew that yet he despised him his brother his own brotherand he could let him go thus lightly  must he adolf ridding accept his life from such a fellow as this   you have talked more than you ought good night brother  i am better the cough is gone i shall sleep now good night the duke stole out with hushed footsteps the wind had fallen suddenly as it does sometimes before dawn and the circles and patches of light upon the ceiling did not waver to adolfs fancy their steadi ness made the quiet room quieter still it seemed to him that long hours ebbed away if sleep depended upon silence surely the king must sleep the painful sound of his had ceased altogether a chill struck home to adolfs heart was he dead  he could not stay there he must look he rose and peered cautiously round the screen by the subdued light of a little silver lamp covered with a paper shade he saw the great bed smooth and white and the shrunk face on the pillow the dedclothea were in perfect order the hand that lay half open on the coverlet looked scarcely like a human thing ah what a ruin of a man was this adolf came a step forward his youth rushed back upon him he remembered only that this man of all men that he had ever seen was the bravest he would have fallen on his knees and kissed those waxen fingers at that moment the kings eyes opened he raised himself upon his arm with a look of indescribable terrorthen fell back putting his hand to his heart tala had spent herself in vain it was not adolf s hand that had fired the shot but it was none the less adolf who killed him  i am not afraid of you now he whispered  come nearer have you forgiven  will you let me sleep p he looked up there was no fear in his eyes adolf saw thisand he could see no more for tears for the historical accuracy of miss coleridges work she makes her appeal to mr nisbet bains life of gustav iii its thorough workmanship and fine presentation of character speak for themselves miss coleridge should hold a high place among the rising school of romancewriters she has undeniable dramatic power and keeps her story throughout

lifelike except perhaps bertha the beautiful who has a bitter bad temper and is a devil incarnate without the sense with which devils are usually accredited the story is a curious kaleidoscope of chances the merest accidents which in themselves are nothing neither fortunate nor the reverse according to the character to which they happen colour the destiny for good or ul falkner lyle the head

increasing his income by these means for he had a private fortune the chief interest of the tale lies in the history of ethelher blameless life and her endeavours to be a good wife under difficult

husband taking away the child when home becomes an unfit residence if she and falkner lyle had married things would have been far different his fine qualities and her virtues were now only like water

novels by mark lemon 3 vols hurst  blackett a man of genius will always show something of his peculiar gift wherever he sets his hand there at a glance is visible the impress of his individuality however trite the subject may have become by other peoples bungling attempts to fashion it into shape it reminds us very much of a horticultural show where prizes are offered for the best group of flowers all have had the same power of choice in making their nosegays but your attention is immediately arrested by the work of the exhibitor who has vindicated his claim to the reward it is the bold arrangement the happy contrasting the delicate suppression of what is coarse and vulgar the copy of nature leaving out her defectsin a word it is the whole perfect work which astonishes us why did we not see all this before  we could have added a hint or two to our own attempt and have beaten the prize bouquet no doubt but happily even in literature you cant steal hints without detection you may destroy an authors just profits by pirating his works but you cant filch his fame quite so easily  falkner lyle  is just such a novel as proves its author to be possessed of this power of superiority which we have tried to illustrate the plot is well conceived and skilfully developed the scene opens with a school and the proverb that the child is father of the man is painted for us in distinct colours almost every one who has been brought up at a large school can recall the actions of the boy which only too surely have ended in the follies and misfortunes not to use harsher terms of the man the hero of the tale  falkner lyle is an orphan with a crusty old bachelor uncle who lived in clubs and did did not want his nephews company falkner has to work for his future livelihood and studies accordingly tom lazenby and henry brownlow with ari under master named bumpstead with the head master and his daughter dr meriton and ethel are to be the dramatis personae brownlow is dismissed in disgrace for theft and still worse for trying to throw the blame on tom lazenby who is a goodnatured overgrown dunce a great friend of lyle falkner falls in love with ethel and his overtures are somewhat coldly received although he has a claim on the doctor by having saved him from an attack made by some highwaymen  please falkner lyle do not do thus any moree m is what we may call the  mittimus  offered him falkner becomes a mrcs having made a confident of old bumps the usher who gives a reason for his own selfneglect by recounting a terrible story of the disappointment which had soured his life he while young was also studying for the medical profession and what was called walking the hospitals going into the dissectingroom he there finds the body of his own lady love laid as a subject on the table it was in the days of resurrection men and not even intelligence of her death had previously reached him owing to the aversion of the father to the match he nearly goes mad imt recovers only to live without any care for the future falkner meets bertha clare the belle of a fashionable watering placean indian heiress and almost entirely her own ftmttk she is beautiful but utterly heart scorns the people with whom she retired from business bertha and marries him out of pique at the neglect shown her by charles marston whose sister is her great friend bertha compromises herself with marston and a separation is agreed to between herself and her husband she is to keep her daughter and her own fortune settled on herself falkner discovers that the child is very much neglected being put out to nurse and with the aid of old bumps steals her and deposits her with dr meritons household ethel being willing to take the charge of the infant falkner goes to india and meets with marston marston writes to rosa his sister and informs her that he has met falkner rosa conveys the news to bertha who rages at the thought of being outwitted by her husband and having lost a means of tormenting him falkner saves marstons life in india and is relieved by hearing that no reason for a divorce existed so far as marston was concerned between the husband and wife the scene is now laid at st gnats where miss carrington really bertha lyle and rosa marston and tom lazenby are residing near this town is the village of smallfield the curate of which place falls in love with a miss brownlow daughter of a widow lady residing with her mother miss betty eke a scandalmongering spinster forms one of the society to which we are introduced miss eke discovers the attachment of philip roy the curate to miss brownlow the railway panic arrives and the rector of the parish is ruined by speculation and by some extraordinary juggling the living is bought for philip by his aunt and miss carrington bertha discovers that mrs brownlow was her husbands first love and imagines that miss brownlow is really falkners daughter born out of wedlock she taunts mrs brownlow with her early sins as she calls the discovery the story goes back and describes dr  meritons illfortune and the marriage of ethel with brownlow the boy who stole at school and has been turned out of his club for cheating by means of a peculiarlymade pack of cards brownlows career of roguery is very interesting and we fear only too common a descent with manyhe is at length murdered by his confederates

nurses saythat she disappears in a fury and poisons herself leaving her money to charles marstoninsinuating a connexion between herself and captain marston to rplague her husband finally falkner marries his old love ethel and philip the curate marries adalyle the vindictive character of bertha is well worked out we think that the description of the blacklegs and their doings is perhaps the part of the book most true to nature the style is lively and agreeable the only improbable feature in the story is the malignant hatred of bertha the first wife  otherwise the  story of two wives  is not only very original but also a very natural production  falner lwyle or the story of two wives by mark  lemon in three volumes hurst and blackett there is a kindliness in all mr mark lemons novels that makes them very wholesome reading he has a heartless and determined woman for one of his heroines dogged enough to go all the way to india and back to ask a question that may help her in carrying a point spitefully and across the atlantic too upon the chance of finding some one else to answer her but our genial author good hater as this heroine is cannot make any one hate even her we rather pity the cold selfish bertha when she writhes in after life under the whips of those tormenting furies her own passions she is the wife incapable of love married to falkner lyle a man most capable of loving while the daughter of falkners good old schoolmaster she who was the idol of his schoolboy affection is the wife capable of love married for love of her father to a liar and a cheat and paying even to him all that is possible of wifely duty the good husband finds the good wife after many years but in the meantime hey suffer much one for marriage with a wife loved through the eyes only and the other for a marriage made from filial duty without hope of hearty wedded love the story opens at the school and some chief persons of it are first shown as schoolboys with their future characters already indicated as they pass from youth to manhood mysteries of life gather about them they have as we have said in mr mark lemon a wise and merciful interpreter the rascal brownlow to whom ethel is married has a redeeming feature in his love for her and is  almost  persuaded by her to be an honest man brimful of kindly humour is the sketch of the simplehearted school tutor mr bumps a forlorn middleaged man at the beginning of the story and its good genius throughout the old schoolmaster at the cedars dr meriton whom we see in his prime and in his decline is a tenderly drawn sketch the pictures of life are unstrained and various but always english there is middleclass home life not forgetting the scandalmaker citizen life england at the seaside at the picnic tourist abroad in the

the lodgingbouse keeper was rather appalled at first by the amount of provender which continued to arrive until a late hour of the afternoon a little reflection however reconciled her to the importations as she knew that her own larder would be benefited by the profusion mrs mallett went to drem at four oclock and her toilette was hardly completed at a quarter to six when her husband came

he was by profession a shoemaker but confinement and the odour of wax did not agree with him he said and waitering suited him better he was called waxy mrs mallett had been told by her husband to spare no expense and she had obeyed his injunction bhe had provided a small gastronomical museum the resources of the louse had been devoted entirely to the vegetables roasts and boils remembering vaguely some of the delicacies which had come within her knowledge during her days of servitude she bad contrived to impart an idea of the components of those dishes to a pastrycook who with a daring worthy of the cause undertook to produce thm the fish was a success being indigenous to the oast and dressed without pretension the soups four in number were rather gluey or oleaginouv having been purchased by the pound and warmed up in saucepans the astrdea were rather in exes mrs mallett having arranged three for each person as  she could not for the life of her she said  recollect what they were made of and as neither the maid jane nor waxy could pronounce one of the names written on the covers by the pastrycook there was quite a game of edible speculation going on while the entrees were in circulation mallett only increased the difficulty by challenging the gentlemen to take wine with him every five minutes and disturbed the selfpossession of waxy to such an extent that he nearly broke a bloodvenel in attempting to draw the cork of a champagne bottle without having fart cut the wire the two guests did their best to assist the progress of the dinner and cover the blunders but

B4774	['9435559']	  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering

enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief there is a certain gerald annesley a handsome blackguard who has known georgie in former times and who has stirred the first romantic feelings of her heart he renewb acquaintance with her and ida sets herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lovely face the lovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or satisfactory	englishfiction
B1782	['3167331']	  the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face	englishfiction

the favourite reading of legart persons 4mutineers is too violent a title most of the rebels hover timidly between two camps and are probably the more comprehensible to the average reader there are careful pictures of life in ifferent grades there are studies of character forcible in themselves though tfle personages do not group well in the story indeed the story is not very satisfactory it is a succession of incidents rather than a whole perhaps the writer shows himself to best advantage in a few beautiful descrptive passages lt no reader skip that really admirable picture of an august

no difference to her and she persists in asking lionel to give her a home she will not see the impropriety of it she declines going to her fathers house and her beauty and her helplessness and her misery completely disarm him what follows may be guessed sybilla is enchanting as ever and lionel in an unguarded moment swears to love and protect her and make her his wife this we cannot but think weak and unnatural we can forgive lionel for having had his head turned once by so pretty a face but having seen somewhat of her true nature and having since had a vision of such true womanhood as lucy tempest we can feel little pity on his thrusting his head again into such a noose and now a storm bursts lady verners and decimas misery and disapproval his own consciousness about lucy and the extravagance and heartlessness of his new wife would have tried the patience of a saint but not of lionel verner whose forbearance is most exemplary and we trust will teach a lesson to many a sorelytried husband who may read this book we think verners pride may be popular it has many merits and some faults it is too long and detailed and too many vicissitudes occur to the actors in the story even for this world of change and chance but the tone and principle are good and the writing and dialogues easy and unaffected though some few expressions will rather offend the ear of fastidious readers many of the situations are dramatic and we may congratulate mrs wood on the fact that her fourth novel has not fallen off from thc promise of east lynne  vetrners pride it is

to amuse and somewhat instruct them it does seem very odd that there should be such a run on crimie there is always enough in the ticsr with the advantage of not being nonsensical as well as shocking but if the interest felt in these vulgar lady as and lady is is mnerely bred by a literary toadyism then the case is still more hopeless we must however rive up the problem of why these books are read though we caln perhaps account for their beingr written a novel written hurriedly to order for a weekly periodical is expected to have a fixed amount of  sensation in each nunmber while it would he unreasonable to expect much artistic handling of the plot or delicate finish of detail such as made  adam bede almost a perfect novel just as the readers of the london journal or family herald qre weekly gratified by reading how the lady gwendolen shot two ruffians or the o l marquis was smitten ly heaven for his crimes so the more refined subscribers to the popular magazines expect at least a fresh murder or bigamy started in each number it is like reading a succession of slovenly repoits of a series of road murders some writers take special lines for instance a very celebrated authoress has almost monopolised the bigamy department  but the writer of verners pride has boldly attempted success in all sorts of crime at once the extraordinary success of  east lynne which appeared in a religious weekly paper led to a large sale of  the clhannings and mrs halliburtons troubles which are a mixture of diluted tonm browns schooldays  and reports on petty larceny verners pride is a still more ambitious attempt in the numbers of once a week it abandons the evangelical teaching of its predecessors and is confined to crime the plot is not over simple and yet is hardly worthy of being called a plot at all it has as much complicated action as would fill a story like the  woman in white  or  no name  but the improbability is not redeemed by skilful use of the theatrical apparatus of fiction which makes those novels amusing for a time the owner of the estate of  verners pride conceives that hie is bound to restore it at his death to the son of his elder brother rather than to leave it to his own stepsons on account however of suspecting his nephew to be the hero of a very brutal seduction and murder he alters his will the actual murderer might easily have been found by the police as one of the three young gentlemen was seen with the girl when she was drowned no one could say which of the three it was and the matter is allowed to rest in fact had the police come on the scene the book could not have gone on for the uncertainty allows each of the three in turn to be considered the murderer and in turn to tantalise a melodramatic brother who goes round the pond publicly and continually with a guin and only wants to shoot the right man in the right place shortly before the old mans death he alters his will again and gives back the estate to lionel by a codicil which is witnessed by an old friend and a doctor whose daughter has just married the reputed heir for his expectations of course as the doctor was by no means an interested witness it is strange that he should steal the codicil and thereby make his daughter the wife of the heir it is far stranger that no one suspects him though there was verners pride by mrs henry wood authoress of  east lynne london bradbury  evans no one else to do it stranger still that the ouisted owner only mutters something about police but iiever sends ftr them  and perhaps strangest of all that the wicked dloctr never destroys the codicil but persists in leavin it about so as tlwatys to be oln the vergre of discovery when at last an explosioln of cleijinals throws it before the riglht inan the doctor is mildly treated even then jan verner a comic character brings the news to the then owner of the land that codicil has come to light joliim u1led on viorously staring at jaii but zvei speakiiig the

untold gold  what a very extraordinary course of events seenii to have taken place with regard to verners pride  now vouir brotheris  now not his  theit his again then not his i cannot make it out but we muiiist mention some of the chief characters as wveii as the plot the hero lionel is rather like mtar arlxve in east lynniie le is meant to be perfect and is only dull  lie mnarries a1 widow sibylla but is all along mnakingr love to and kissing the other perfect character lucy at one time lie is certlaill that hils wifes first husband is alive  lie thinks it would le unfair to hcave her a inst her will she however remains under a protest that she intends to keep to the real owner of  verners pride whoever h  mlay be this brings us to the character of sibylla w0e do not ever remember to have read of a miore repulsively vulgar naid lad character she is however o1ny meant to be silly anl a little unprinciplld though very charming we should not so 111uich mind her robbing her husband or even twitting him cnt inualyv with  her first but when it comes to her chuckling at hilll and  cliafflng hint for the abovemnentioned seduction and murder which she looks on as a venial peccadthillo it is a little too bad the real culprit turns out to be her first husband but it would be impossible to showy fully the deep vulgarity of this character witoult d oing right through the book which we have done but cotld not conscientiously recommend to any one else it is not only vulgarity of language and bad english to which we ohject but it is to the whole character and the evident feeling of the writer that she has only drawn a frivolous little lady the other women in the book are not so objectionable there is a cold and haughty lady verner a good lady mary who makes love to the second hero a surgeon  also lucy beforenmentioned who is drawn as the perfection of female character and who makes rather broader love to the first hero then wve have a certain mrs peckaby comic who wants to be a morinon and certain iiysteriously bad characters who are kept in the background throughout the book we are only told that they are bad characters the comic characters are better than the serious because the vulgarity is not quite so apparent here the second hero is meant to be very comic jan is a surgeon brother to lionel verner who is always very blunt and simple sometlmnes to the verge of idiocy and who always dangles his legs there is a blacksmith peckaby who laughls at his wife for expecting a white donkev to take her to the new jerusalem and a master cheese who eats enormously each of these characters have their special point of conmedy and they are not in one single intance alluded to without miiaking that point it will be seen that the jokes must be very good not to be spoilt by all this repetition the estate of verners pride after fluctuating letweell lionel and his stepcousins john and frederick who are all in turn the owners finally comes to lionel the rough golddigrger john massingbird who was lead for the first volume and a half finally retires and does not continue his practice of impersonating his dead brother frederick as a ghost running round the pond where the poor girl died that refined joke produces a good deal of complication in the second volume and threatens at one time to make out lionel a bigamist  that is happily prevented by honest jan garotting the ghost then sibylla is removed by making her dance to death at a ball so that nothingr remains but the happy mnarriaoe of the hero and heroine this is delayed for a little time by the fact that lionel is in debt  and there is one pathetic scene where he tells lucy of it   i am a poor man now lucy worse than without prospects if you knew all and i do not know why you should not know all he added after a pause  i am in debt such a man cannot marry  the words were spoken quietly temperately their tone proving how hopeless could be any appeal against them whether from him from her or from without it was perfectly true lionel verners position placed him beyond the reach of social ties this passage may be taken as a fair sample of the sentimental parts of  verneris pride as we said before the broadly comic parts are better in style but monotonous  and we must say that the characters for the most part are either insipid unpleasant or vulrar we cannot therefore speak in very high terms of this i last specimen of the sensational or renaissance newgrate school either as to its plot its sentiments or its english  the literary examiner verner pride by mrs henry wood author of east lynne ac in three volumes bradbury and evans aurora floyd by m e braddon author of lady audleys secret in three volumes tinsley brothers the slight but kindly recognition of weak cleverness that is all the criticism fairly due from us to novels by the authoress of east lynne and the silence in which it would be kindness to pass over the crude coarse and prosaic tales of bigamy and murder by the authoress of lady audleys secret no longer fit the time when these writers have been forcedchiefly or altogether we fear by the misapplied laudations of a critic in the timesinto a popularity discreditable to the public taste the popularity no doubt is artificial largely made up of the applause of those who would be influenced in their judgement by announcements of tremendous success in an advertisement or street placard of miss braddon the authoress of lady audleys secret newspapers have been telling us lately that she was a provincial actress and a writer in reynoldss miscellany for that journal her style and matter were we can suppose perfectly well suited her novels are of the school of mr g w m reynolds literature of the kitchen as it used to be and to give currency to them among educated readers without placing the name of reynolds on a level with that of sir walter scott miss austin or mr dickens is a gross injustice how long too will society refuse to place the name of its smith beside that of its shakespeare there is a mr smith whose works of fiction appear in penny weeklies not yet fashionable and achieve an immense success among the class of readers whose coarse fare is now sought by the dainty he has we believe more readers than mr dickens why shall he not be fetched up out of the kitchen  a pleasant writer in one of the magazines this month pictures an exquisite gentleman to whom everything upon his daintilyappointed breakfast table is uneatable  did you ever asks his doctor who is breakfasting with him  try a red herring   here is a glorious idea here is an absolutely new sensation to be got the faithful serving man is dispatched immediately to fortnum and masons for a red herring he goes to a chandlers shop in a back alley to buy the herring and his master eats the whole of it with utmost relish there are some fastidious novel readers to whom one of miss braddons stories may have in this way the relish of a penny herring out of the back alley what is there to raise the novels of these ladies above mediocrity are they good in language thought or story  good writing will often cover weakness of invention original thought will give a true charm even to a tale careless in diction and poor in plot or a wellcontrived plot will make the fortune of a tale in which the writing is poor and all the thoughts are superficial in all mrs woods novels the language is weak sinning as nine average novels in ten do but much more than is customary against grammar and as the lady would say  to a degree we are very sure also that neither mrs wood nor miss braddon whose novels are coarser and worse than mrs woods has achieved in any book one shrewd and original thought at every turn of events that suggests reflection each lady punctually and exclusively provides her reader with the commonplace appointed for the occasion the merit may lie perhaps in the farfetched invention of their tales in which they labour to be sensational here however to mrs woods especial credit be it said one lady bases her fiction on a womanly notion of right and shows a sense of delicacy that restrains her from the coarser imaginings of the sensation novelist for this reason she is falling behind in the race she cannot give her mind sufficiently to the painting of a true halo of bigamy and murder about the head of any heroine or hero in this story of verneys pride mrs wood doubtless begins well enough as notions of a good beginning go by mysteriously drowning a seduced girl in a pond and raising a question of who put her in  four or five persons go through some part of the story with the now relishable game flavour of a taint of suspicion of murder on the readers mind and then in the second volume a first husband buried in australia is so distinctly supposed to have reappeared that the full relish of bigamy is given to a portion of the story but the murder proves after all to have been no murder a mere case of seduction and suicide and the bigamy is wiped out after it had been carefully painted in the reappeared husband proves to have been personated if mrs wood desires to run a race of popularity with miss braddon there must be no baulking of the readers appetite for bigamy and murder there must be constant addition instead of diminution of the dose of cayenne in the literary curry it is more than time that we had three husbands to embarrass any really interesting heroine lady audley was glad to think she had got rid of her first by putting him down the well and then only tried to rid herself of an inconvenient inquirer by burning him in his bed but think of the shifts and perplexities of a wife with eight husbands being not only mysteriously married like aurora floyd to her noble husbands horsetrainer but also to the beadle of whose cane she is in dread and also to the emperor of china who writes compromising letters by each mail the more compromising as she is also secretly married to the postman who is of a suspicious temper and may open any letter addressed to her also under peculiar circumstances to the giant of a show that is coming to be wt up at a fair in the neighbourhood also to a maniac whom she keeps ia the cellar for whioh reason aa ta f ro to th in m wi jo joi j j mi rei bli alone carries the key of the cellar and also to the rector of the parish who believes her to be on a friendly visit at the grand house which must always be in the centre of the stories of this school medea blenkinsop or the octogamist or pails of bloodwhat a tale might be made of it think of the mere difficulty between two husbands the squire and rector of the parishhow to keep them from knowing that they both had the same wife  what floods of interesting lies the heroine would have to tell this is the direction in which mrs wood must travel if she is to retain her popularity she must not think to make a sensation with mere makebelieve bigamy let her study punch read in the profound pages of that philosopher the thrilling romance of  mokeanna and write something like that we forget how many slops of fiction a sensation writer of the new school usually drops at a time say three then how delicious would be the exercise of ingenuity in threading the maze among three dozen or more husbands of three fair polygamist heroines before breakfast medea blenkinsop having by great ingenuity got her husband the beadle up into the belfry stands below pulls a rope and crushes his head with the clapper of the great bell as the bone crushes between bell and clapper there is a muffled toll that strikes into the heart of every villager author going to breakfast upon devilled herring leaves mrs blenkinsop at the bellrope and coming back resumes the midnight conversation in another story between the black ratcatcher and his wife the marchioness of bloodybones in deadmans lane she was left on the point of paying him two thousand pounds to go away  we are  observed says he and authoress proceeds to bring a hunchback into the hedge who picks the ladys pocket of her handkerchief and after she has gone with that handkerchief smothers the ratcatcher leaving him with the marchionesss cypher and initials hanging out of his mouth the author dines on pork pie and plum cake and returns to the affairs of a third heroine who has a will to forge before explaining in a soliloquy how the relentless hand of destiny has made her what she is and she is more to be pitied than blamed for having married and poisoned twentyseven of her lovers he for whom she stealthily retires to sweeten a nightdraught is the twentyeight she will fly to sunny italy tomorrow with the stableboy we have not yet quite reached this perfection of sensation writing but are fairly on the way to it and now let us look to mrs wood who with all her faults is a writer more worth notice than miss braddon for some illustrations of the sort of english that is suitable to a sensation novel verners pride is the name of a house built by old mr verner to replace another on the same estate that was  a high narrow old thing the old man had two sons one his companion at home the other colonel sir lionel who had a boy at eton when the old man grew near to death sir lionel  was bade get leave of absence if possible but he also being dead verners pride was bequeathed to his brother not to his son the son of the eldest son the youth at eton who becomes the hero of the story thc new master of verners pride married  a widow lady of the name of massingbird who had two nearly grownup sons john and frederick these lived at verners pride with young lionel the adopted son and natural heir of the property it was frederick massingbird who seduced rachel frost he is a sly villain with a sensation mark upon his face  a very strangelooking mark indeed quite as large as a pigeons egg with  what looked like radii shooting from it on all sides  some of the villagers talking familiarly among them selves would call it a hedgehog some would call it a  porkypine but it resembled a star as much as anything  that is if you can imagine a black star the mark  was black as jet and his pale cheek and the fact of his possessing no whiskers made it all the moro con 8picuous bi this sort of portraitpainting is emphatic enough certainly but to make it more so the author gives mr frederick a habit of gently rubbing his finger round and round the mark on his cheek there is an emphatic way too of putting the effect of a discovery  it electrified  deerham it electrified mrs verner it worse than elec trifled matthew frost and robin by another incident  lionel mrs verner jan and sir rufus hautley were  petrified there is an emphatic ordering of words too with which mrs wood produces comical effects in this manner it is not written  she sat down on a chair but it is written  down on a chair sat she or  one laid  hold of his head another of his feet but make  nothing of him could they or  it caused quite  a confusion the entrance of dr west dislocation of the limbs of sentences with full stops fired like bullets into them is another way of bringing readers up with a mild jerk mrs verner  was rather addicted to dropping  asleep with her last glass of wine and waking up with the teatray as she did on this evening lucy  noticed that he had left the parchment behind him and ran after him with it catching him as he was about to  close the halldoor here mrs wood is comically solemn with a semicolon after a wedding breakfast sir ed mund and lady hautley had left then but those who re maincd wanted some dinner and had it we first see john massingbird in his brothers presence preparing for a journey to australia stowing his litter into the boxes  not  all sixes and sevens like it looked as it lay but compactly  and artistically  he was the bestlooking of the two mrs woods misuse of the word like is habitual we read of  a heavy groan born of displeasure miogled with  pain like

impulse to  hx the destiny of a	
life the two conductors of a painted donkey  were muffled up as befitted the inclemency  of the night something like their voices appeared to have been no detached evidence of the slipslop of mrs woods style and  east lynne was in this respect worse not better than vernors pride will convey to one who has not read the book itself the impression of illwritten english that every page of her writing gives even when it contains no technical faults lionel verner comes in for the tail of the dinner john set on to spend his portion as fast as he could to be  sometime the mistress of verners pride was a very vista of desire mrs wood has some such notion of the meaning of a vista as we might expect from a lady who blends direct vulgarity with the indirect vulgarity in use of fine phrases common among the uneducated from lionel to lady verner a hint is sufficient  to induce her to preserve reticence what is in a small house too narrow to be called a hall mrs wood calls not a passage but a vestibule pretty mrs massingbird showing her face unexpectedly to lionel  for one single  moment lionel was lost in the beauty of the vista in connexion with a country doctor we have a new use of the word auspices  jans window being as you may  remember nearly on a level with the ground presented favourable auspices for holding a facetoface colloquy  with night visitors when does mrs wood think that a man is not a being   jan went on like a steamengine lionel remained stand ing at his entrance gate more like a prostrate being than a  living man a rough soldier captain cannonby who has tossed about the world and who speaks of his brother the doctor making  a sight of money tells of the death in his presence of frederick massingbird in australia  he died  at early dawn just as the sun bunt out to illumine the  heavens lionel on one of the occasions of his being dislodged from verners pride would study lawbooks and  says the fair authoress  awfully dry work he found it  not in the least congenial and many a time did he long  to pitch the whole lot c beyond mrs duffs shop you  come upon an opening on the left hand which led  to quite a swarm of cottages mrs verner was  put  to shifts by the bailiffs death  you ascertained no certain news of john massingbird i hear observed lady verner sibylla also knew and she read  arightly the drooping of their faces of a number of women it is said that  they to hear them talk would rather have enjoyed an encounter solus with the ghost than not  roy spoke unusually impressive for him lucy says to lionel  mr cust had used to tell us jan the surgeon says of sibyllas temper you remember how it had  used to be with her at home sibylla is thought weak in the chest  not more weak than i had used to be9 she answers lionel says  i cannot reconcile it to my conscience mother to remain on here his mother says  you will give up this london scheme will you  not and remain on elsewhere   lionel declined the  grog but he remained on talking things over afterwards john massingbird remained on with him his  guest eat stands for ate  we had a beautiful piece of roast beef and im sure you eat as much as you  chose  dr west had accepted a cup of coffee he  kept it in his hand sipping it now and then and slowly  eat a biscuit  nightfogs are pernicious to a degree says this physician john massingbird spoke to the doctor  with his mouth full of devilled kidneys and  could  not by any manner of means be induced  to take his hints but the rough john with diggers habits usually says  deemed  for thought and of his smoking in bed says tynn lives in perpetual torment lest my bed  should ignite some night lucy  sat with ber  head a little bent scenting her verbena lucy the refined and educated heroine warns lionel against a danger saying  i know you will not see it for yourself  and that is the reason why i am presumptive enough to suggest the idea to you for which consideration we are told directly afterwards lionel  could not help  pressing her hand warmer than was needful as he placed  her in the carriage in despair over her own grammar mrs wood uses pronouns in place of nouns and adds the nouns lest the pronouns should point in the wrong direction  decima went indoors for some string to tie up a fuchsia  plant just as she tynn appeared at the iron gates  they the women gathered together and pressed

it these descriptions ara dropped in sometimes with random haste a mr butterworth is described on one page as alittle man with a pimpled face on the very next page we read of his hale old face an offensive seising of the reader by the button for a jerk of personal address is part of the bad taste of the writer we have such sentences as  the old study that  you have seen before you have now seen him do  so once again of some dress of the heroines you saw her in it the evening she first came to lady  verners fat mrs verner couldnt be made to walk  yon may have met with some such case in your own experience it was a young gentleman whom you have had the pleasure of meeting beforemaster dan  duff lady verner  would have gone on foot to visit  the countess of elmsley and lady mary but not sibylla  you can understand the distinction  you once saw  the chamber of john massingbird in this same house in  a tolerable litter somebody  might be going dead     as you will find also if you will make an evening call upon mrs duff lukeif you have not forgottenhad said to mr eyre and so forth like all who speak or write bad grammar mrs wood affects to be critical she describes the servant rachel who was drowned in the pond as  refined as any lady  and her manners and speech would not have destroyed the  illusion so when she visits her father in his cottage rachel says  do not fear that i came clandestinelyor  as our servants would say on the sly when brother jarrum the mormon speaks of  uncredible reports mrs wood with her superior purity of speech tells us that brother jarrum probably intended to say unaccredited and when deborah west says  its only me mrs wood thinks it necessary to observe that she  did not at all  times confine herself to therules of severe grammar we have cited example enough to make it clear that mrs woods novels are not to be read for any charm of style the depth of her reflective power is to be measured by such original sentiment as this it is the silent sorrow  that eats into the heart the loud grief does not tell  upon it or this which may appear lovely to the cooks and nursemaids whose taste is now leading a fashion in the world of fiction there was no mistake about it lucy had grown to love lionel verner how she loved him esteemed him venerated him none save her own heart could tell her days had been as one long drano of eden the very aspect of the world bad changed the blue sky the sect breathing wind the scent of the budding flowers had spoken a language to her never before learned  r juice in us for wt are lovely it was the strange blisa in her own heart that threw its rose hues over the face of nature the aweet mysterious rapture arising from loves first dream which can never be described by mortal pen and never while it lasts can be spoken of by living tongue while it lasts it never does last it is the one sole ecstatic phase of life the solitary romance stealing in once and hut once amidst the worlds bard realities the fire filched for us from heaven has it to arise yet for youyou who read this  do not trust it when it comes for it will be fleeting as a summer cloud eojoy it revel in it while you hold it it will lift you out of earth elay and earths evil with its angel wings but trust not to its remaining even while you are saying  i will make it mine for ever it is gone it had gone for lucy tempest and oh better for her perhaps that it should go better perhaps for all for if that sweat glimpse of paradiae could take up its abode permanently in the heart we should never look or wish or pray for that better paradise which has to come hereafter  vergers pride by mrs hexey wood three vols post 8vo bradbury and evans 1863 remembering the sensation which  east lynne created on its first

B1345	['6016556']	  the soul of lilith by miss marie corellt 3 vols richard bentley and sons novel which in a very few weeks after its publication is advertised by the publishers in ordinary to her majesty the queen as being in its fourth edition in threevolume form can at least claim to have hit the taste of a large por tion of the fictionreading public on this ground if upon no other miss corellis last book has a fair title to be considered one of the most notable novels of the past month this success has been attained it is said in spite of rough treatment by the critics whose notices have not been read by the present writer he has however seen a good many paragraphs in various journals describing with much insistence the anxiety displayed by the queen to read this book and the pleasure her majesty has derived from doing so how do they get about those paragraphs which crop up in all sorts of unlikely places giving all sorts of information about the comings and goings the actions and intentions of some writers no theory of spontaneous generation can be entertained for a mnoment it is unlikely that the most successful writer can have a paragraphist attached to his household to act the part played by the herald in a tourney miss corelli herself would appear to feel little gratitude to the press which she accuses in the book under notice of gross unfairness to literary woomen a successful novelist who is one of the female characters in  the soul of lilith protests against  the pitiless storm that assails literary work known to emanate from a womans brain and is only comforted when the hero assures her that  an intellectual woman sets a barrier between herself and the beasts they lnuest detest you in selflefence most of your adverse critics are the poorlypaid hacks of the daily journals who envy you your house your horses your good fortune and your popu larity with the public such opinions show that miss corelli cannot think that she owes any of her own popularity to the puffing of the press she so heartily despises it may be however that if miss corelli is badly treated by the poorlypaid hacks she is admired by injudicious friends who entirely against her own wishes endeavour to  quarter on the enemy so to speak by getting inserted in these very daily journals many paragraphs about the interest the royal famuilyof england take in her last book the advantageous terms she has made with her publishers the handsome revenue she derives from the large sale of her works and all the other varieties of the puff preliminary this seems the most tenable theory and an incident of which we have direct knowledge goes to support it some time since there arrived at the office of the novel review a manuscript entitled 1 a few notes on a celebrated novelist giving various information about miss corelli this was sent back to the name and address given as that of the writer who however seems to have been one of those who  do good by stealth and blush to find it fame for the manuscript was returned through the post as having been unclaimed at the address given its return however relieves the present writer of a difficulty he and he trusts miss corelli will forgive him the crime implied in this admission of his sex on the ground that in this matter he is the victim of circumstances over which he had no control is innocent of any knowledge of the author of  the soul of lilith other than that which can be obtained by readng some of her earlier books now in these days there is an nsatiable desire for personal details about any one who is before the publica desire which appears in its most generous manifestation as heroworship and in its meanest leads people to read the society papers and to visit the chamber of horrors that the lower forms of this desire are wholly detestable is no reason why its higher forms should not be gratified any invasion of the private life of notable persons is undesirable but men or women who seek the suffrages of the public as polticians or writers have themselves and not that public to blame when people want to know all about their political or literary development and when the demand for such informa tion is supplied by the omniscient press the novel revievw is glad to tell the novelreading public all that can fairly be told about the men and women who cater for their amusement and instruction and in the particular case in hand it is possible that our readers may like to know something about miss marie corelli it is perhaps best therefore to give here just as they were sent in by the retiring informant abovementioneda few notes on a celebrated novelist miss marie corelli the author of that extraordinary book a rmance of two worlds and the still more remarkable ardath the story of a dead self of which the spectator justly observed that it had beaten beckfords  vathek is the most unapllroachable of living novelists not from any lack of geniality but simply from her unalterable resolution not to be interviewed she occupies the almost unique position of being a pretty woman who has never beeil i photographed lbcause she dislikes the idea of her  counterfeit presentment being sold in the shops for a shilling she has gained her wide popularity without a single  boom having no advantages in the way of friends or personal connexions on the press the sales of her books are enormously on the increase aud from her royalties alone she has a handsome annual income she has a large daily batch of letters from all parts of the world and among her correspondents she counts the queen of italy lord tennyson mr gladstone theodore watts ouida rider haggard and hosts of other wellknown and distinguished people who hold her in the greatest esteem and regard there is not the slightest doubt that she is an extremely pretty and fascinating person and her sympathetic interest in and ready practical aid extended to the struggling aud unfortunate in her own and other artistic lprofessionls is a notable feature of her lovable character she is the very woman who ought to form a  salon after the old french methods for she is the most perfect hostess imaginable never at a loss always realy with some graceful word that puts the awkward at their ease and charms the most indifferent her manner is truly the essence of high courtesy when i first saw her a slight petite figure arrayed in a lovely teagown of vieuxrose velvet a diamond comb catching up the luxuriant mass of her fair hair and noted her joyous childlike smile her radiant eyes her whole aspect so unfagged so riante so altogether anliterary i had much ado to convince myself that she was really the author of the complex and wonderful  ardath t p oconnor calls her  dresden china an epithet which exactly suits her blonde tresses and dazzling complexion and that  dresden china actually wrote that terrible absinthe story  wormwood does seem a curious anomaly she is the darling of her home the idol of her friends and the wags of publishinghouses call her bentleys favourite which it would seem she is personally as well as from a businesspoint of view it is rurnoured that she is to be  sent for to windsor the queen being much fascinated by the originality and poetic beauty of her writings one would be curious to know what her majesty will think of the bewitching little woman herself who has been capable of holding her own in an argument with m1r gladstone andl even causing that  grand old m1an to resign on one occasion a discussion in the house where he was expected for the sake of an afternoon in her company in her own home she receives lords dukes and commoners with equal ease and grace in fact no one is more a favourite with the  upper ten than the pretty marie whose social charm consists in complete unselfish ness and rare tact she can never be persuaded to talk of her self or her works but she will talk of others with enthusiasm and generosity her praise is delicious because so ungrudging add to all this that she is one of the wealthiest amonom the members of the literary profession and can command higher terms for her books than anyone at present to the front that she never works unless it pleases her and even then takes her own time about it and certainly never grinds at anything and we shall have obtained a glimpse as  through a glass darkly at one of the most eminent charming and brilliant women of the time onlooker we have nothing to add to the above account for the accuracy of which we of course cannot vouch and proceed to a consideration of the novel itself in an introduetorv note the author disclaims the tite of novel for her work it is she says  simuply the account of a strange and daring experiment once actually attempted and is offered to those who are interested in the unseen  possibilities of the hereafter merely for what it isa single episode in the life of a inan who voluntarily sacrificed his whole worldly career in a supreme effort to prove the apparently unprovable the hero of this experiment is named elraami a gentleman with a skin dark as a mulattos a black moustache and perfectly white hair but more remarkable still for a pair of eyes which enable him to exercise extraordinary powers he is introduced to us at a performance of  hamlet where he looks full at an american heiress who has been much struck by his appearance  with an instinctive movement she recoiled and her own eyes fell never in all her giddy thoughtless little life had she seen such fiery nightblack brilliant orbs merciful as he is strong el ranii removes his  piercing gaze and informs one sir frederick vaughan a fair dissipatedlooking young fellow who speaks to him that tiie girls name is idina chester that vaughan will be intro uced to her that evening and engaged to her in a fortnight and the prophecy is immediately verified this cheap piece of supernatural dexterity is explained by elratmi on his way home in the first of some dozens of soliloquies in which he indulges as merely a calculation founded on his knowledge of the persons concerned elranmi knows that vaughan is in debt and open to any offer front an heiress that his cousin lord nelthorpe is tired of paying his debts and determined to marry hilm off to miss chester and that  the little chester girl has her heart set on an english title even though it be only that of a baronet the reader is thus led to hope that elrimni is no ordinary thoughtreading quack but is merely gifted with a purely natural but highlycultivated faculty for putting two and two together like the heroes of edgar allan poe intl his imitators these holipes are quickly dashed before he had got further than apsley house on his homeward wav a man snatched his watch and at once  uttered a loud cry and remained inert and motionless elratmi c oidly smnilin takes the watch back and informs the thief that he elrtmi is a  human torpedo and againi soliloquising vaguely on the constitution of things wvends his way to  an unpretentious little house in a small quiet unfashionable square off sloane streetand the reader prepares for the worst amid dim red ligfits an i electric  burners peculiar and costly silks sarkling with iridescent gleams globes geometrical instruments a pile of letters from princes diplomats aud financiers he goes off into another soliloquy in which he declares that knowledge of the earthly future is not enough he imust learn the great secret wanting to call his brother he just concentrates his thoughts  his eyes dilated and grew luridly brilliant as though sparks of fire burnt behind them and in a couple of minutes his beautiful young brother fetraz arrives in a loose white tunic and a hypnotic trance by his occult powers elruni keeps his brother in a cataleptic state at will and when the youth returns to consciousness he plays on an ebonycased pianette the harvesthome songs of the reapers in a bright and faroff star music that  utters divine and dulcet eloquence and then we are introduced to lilith elrlmtiizaranos to give the human torpedo his full style and title some six years b1fore in the course of a journey across the syrian desert had come upon a caravan of arabs in dire distress from want and sickness one of these an elderly widow named zaroba he miraculously cures another an orphan child named lilith he keeps in a state between life and death in the unpretentious house near sloane square with a view to obtaining through her some knowledge about  the great secret he keeps her body alive so to say by injections of a strange sparkling fluid with  a curiously sweet and pungent odour and recalls her soul to it by fixing his eyes on her  with a glance that seemed to shoot forth flame much of the book is taken up with the conversations between the torpedo and his helpless victim to which nothing but quotations can do justice thus to her elrilmi for instancelisten 0 too

these 8taccalo messages from the unprovable and worries himself a good deal about it in more soliloquies filling his time with feats of legerdemain a clergyman drops in and elrami reads his thoughts which are not of a very edifying nature by placing his left fingers on the vicars left wrist  directly touching the nerves and arteries running through the heart from the brain  but he fails to impress the vicar who  with a bland smile goes off to lunch at the criterion with a lady  brownhaired and darkeyed of a full luscious beauty mindless but physically attractive who is the wife of the vicars wealthiest neighbour and is naturally rather annoyed because the vicar has kept her waiting at the criterion for him for ten minutes our hero has all the stockintrade of an oxford street necromancer and does some reading in manuscripts with  uncanny figures and allegorical designs he throws up a pinch of sparkling powder like diamond dust waves  a thin steel rod about the size of an ordinary walking cane and produces thereby  a round large brilliant globe of prismatic tints like an enormouslyvinagnified soapbubble this is done to exibit his magical powers to a monk from famagousta in cyprus who retaliates by embodying before the incredulous elrfimi  gods deathless messenger and  the straight pure brilliancy and limpid lustre of those unearthly orbs sent shudders through elratui who becomes very ill indeed after this experience the monk is in fact one too many for our hero he displays the most provoking composure when elrami shows him some information which the soul of lilith has brought from  the golden spaces of the stars concerning  the inhabitants of sirius their laws customs and progress and 1 the world of neptune how it is composed of one thousand distinct nations united under one reigning eumperor known at the present era as ustalvian the tenth the monk disappears mysteriously leaving a written message 1 with liliths love comes liliths freedom unfortunately lilith takes to saluting elrami as  my beloved on the return of her soul to her body and this causes ian icy thrill to run through his veins hence comes great delight to her nurse zaroba

missed the one joy of lifelove win it but feraz is too much under the influence of his elder brothers supernatural powers to take her advice and zaroba watches elramis scientific interest giving place to human passion with unholy glee this unpleasant old shearab like most of the characters in the book soliloquises a good deal and one of her muttered speeches is a good specimen of miss corellis

rejoice to see love born again of tlanes and tears and bittersweet as in the ancient lays  for there is no love now such as there used to bethe pale christ has killed it and the red rose agloow with

starlike eyes fullorbed and splendid with a radiant blue as of heavens own forgetmenots but elritlui cannot bear the splendour of this vision he recalls the soul to the body  ascends to a heaven of blind delirious ecstasy and after devouring her loveliness with his eyes curve by curve line by line he pressed upon her his a long burning passionate kiss but lilith cannot bear that and after  a shuddering recoil of muscular agony     crumbles swiftly away into hideous disfigurement andl ashes in spite of hypodermic injections thereupon elrami goes mad a misfortune which does not prevent his soliloquising with as much or as little coherence as before he is taken to famagousta on receipt of a telegram from the head of the order by feraz who becomes brother sebastian and when presented with a rosebud fatuously remarks it is a rose from heaven it is the soul of lilith the above includes the story contained in this book and no one who will be at the pains to read miss corellis three volumes will deny that it gives a fair summary of them space fails us to relate all that elrami did with his  curiouslycarved crystal phials  globules of a glittering green colour and the rest of his apparatus how the old woman zaroba strays into trafalgar square fancies she is in the desert and dies on the embank ment at the foot of cleopatras needle how elrami exclaims in a semilucid interval  lilith is not here not here nor there     she is everywhere and becomes livid or to give the sketch of the experiences of ftraz in a london drawingroom and a london studio nor can we comment on the experiments of one kremlin whom elrami doctors with his electroflamma or vital elixir in order that he may continue to investigate the effects of inooushine and starshine on a magic disc but we have given the substance of the story in the authors own words the reader can now appraise for himself the real value of the book and will probably with us regret the waste of miss corellis unmistakable powers on this kind of thing the success of the book can only be accounted for by the fact that many subscribers to the circulating libraries are possessed of the taste and intelligence of the servant girls who form the clientele of fortunetellers and our latterday witches the plentiful peppering of diluted blasphemy does not prevent the soul of lilith from being trash and trash of the dullest

B4321	['8794124']	  the english novel in the time of shakespeare tty j j jusserand translated from the french by elizabeth lee fisher unwin m jusseraxds little monograph on the english novel originally published in french some five years ago showed how much he could teach us about our own literature his researches are now presented to us in a revised and enlarged shape and the result is a contribution of permanent value to the history of elizabethan literature m jusserand has chosen ground that we ourselves have neglected but his explorations have not been superficial and we are inclined to think that future travellers in the same country will find little new information to supply and few erroneous impressions to correct with thoroughness as an investigator m jusserand combines a faculty of placing his results attractively before his readers and he has been fortunate in securing the assistance of miss elizabeth lee who has done her work of translation satisfactorily throughout miss lees english is always accurate and when it suggests a french idiom we appreciate the scholarly flavour of the rendering the book abounds in pertinent illustrations william rogerss faithful engraving of queen elizabeths portrait forms the frontispiece a view of burghley house exemplifies the richness of elizabethan architecture with which contemporary literature had much in common portraits of sir philip sidney and his sister wellselected plates from such works of imagination as topsoils  fourfooted beastes and  serpents examples of the illustrations employed in french seventeenth century romances all give a charm to the volume which the scholar will appreciate no less than the general reader the useful index deserves a word of praise m jusserand traces the sources of the novel even before the remote date of beowulf but he wisely avoids merely archaeological speculation and begins a detailed treatment of his subject with sir thomas malorys  morte darthur as everybody is aware caxton was the printer of this noble and joyous book but it is less generally known that this was only one of caxtons efforts as printer editor or translator to gratify his patrons insatiable taste for works of fiction the new forms of literature and the new lines of thought which the renaissance introduced seemed to stimulate rather than to check the demand for chivalric romances which had grown steadily through the middle ages as we watch in m jusserands pages the development of the novel from caxtons translations through lord bernerss unwieldy romances to the works of fiction produced by shakespeares contemporaries lyly and greene we are deeply impressed by the permanence of mediaeval influences the early elizabethan writers of romances assimilated much renaissance sentiment but it is not until wo reach nashs studies in real life at the close of the sixteenth century that the medico val leaven is superseded lyly with his wealth of illustration drawn from the scientific speculations of the middle ages and his fanciful descriptions of athens or naples and greene with his stories of knights and kings and courts of chivalry look like lineal descendants of the jongleurs of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they reflect the past and despite m jusserands ingenious and luminous suggestions to the contrary only occasionally foreshadow the future but m jusserand has invested his accounts of lylys work and of that of lylys successors with so much fresh and appreciative comment that it will be impossible hereafter to refuse to these survivals a literary any less than an historical interest lylys hero euphues becomes an attractive figure in the skilful hands of m jusserand but euphuess undoubted affinity at some points to richardsons heroes does not convince us quite so readily as m jusserand is convinced that he is in any literal sense  the ancestor in direct line of grandison  or of lord orville the theory at any rate needs further testing of sidney and pastoral romance of thomas nash and the picaresque novel and of english fiction in the seventeenth century m jusserand treats with far more judgement and knowledge than any of our own countrymen have devoted to the subjects m jusserand is able at times to render his criticism and information more effective by drawing upon his knowledge of french literature for illustrative comments sir thomas malorys sole mention of himself or of his personal opinions throughout his monumental epic is in a short chapter in which he laments the decay in his day of virtuous love m jusserand well contrasts the cold seriousness characteristic of the english romancewriter with the impetuous warmth of the author of aucassin and nicolette the relations between early english and french literature have never been fully investigated and the fact that french translations of greenes romances and of sidneys  arcadia became while elizabeth was still queen almost as popular in paris as the originals were in london will be news for many wellinformed students of our literary history some of them may not be more familiar with the circumstance that the debts which french readers of romance contracted to english authors in the sixteenth century were amply repaid in the seventeenth century when english lovers of fiction satiated themselves with the interminable romances of scud cry or la calprenede in english versions these international amenities which have been much neglected by literary historians are worth dwelling on and in the elaborate history of english literature on which it is generally understood m jusserand has long been engaged we may fairly anticipate to find them fully discussed the points of interest about this book are so numerous than it would be impossible to deal with them in detail here but those who read for amusement only may be as safely recommended to procure it as the smaller class who seek to extend their knowledge of the elizabethan epoch which remains the most brilliant of our literature	englishfiction

B4355	"['8876793', '6792195']"	  the sacred fount new novels by henry james methuen  co mk james narrates this story in the first person so that the experiences and reflections of the narrator appear as if they were mr jamess own in order to keep up the dramatic illusion we shall preserve mr jamess own name in describing the narrator though it must not be imagined that we regard his use of the first person singular as anything but a dramatic fiction  mr james then one summer day found himself at a london terminus on the way to a country house party which we are to believe was one of the smartest for example not only do the husbands pair off as a matter of course with other peoples wives but they do not even take the same trains as their lawful partners moreover the food and the pictures and other luxuries of a decadent civilization are all to be found of the very best at this smartly unconventional establishment poor  mr james the dramatic character evidently not being wholly at home in such a smart set is naturally somewhat impressed and rather shy at the prospect before him but he very sensibly determines to make the most of a unique occasion by going about with a mental not ebook and an inquiring disposition  and he does not lose an instant j in beginning for at the station he sees a mr long whom he had once or twice before met at the same house but who had always hitherto consistently cut him at other places this gentleman he had consequently put down as a fool but on this occasion long recognises him with some warmth and the change is so remarkable and surprising to  mr james that he immediately assumes that long has become quite intelligent and devotes his inquiring mind through the rest of the book to trying to find out how such a change has come about he has not arrived at the end of his train journey before he has elaborated a theory in collaboration with a mrs brissenden who of course is travelling down without her husband and who in the wellknown way of smart poople habitually calls this husband  poor briss the theory shadowy as it is seems to be the chief point of these pages so we shall leave anybody who is sufficiently interested to find it out for himself to find confirmation for it 44mr james has a merry time of it with all the other characters of the book he goes about button  holing all the men generally opening with my dear man to show his intimate knowledge of polite society and even the ladies of the party have an occasional my dear woman tossed to them he does not impart to any of them his theoryhe is far too subtle for thatbut he tries to lead them by the most terribly long  winded conversations into admissions of a position of which they are supremely unconscious to do them justice most of his interlocutors are supremely bored by liim and have very little scruple in telling him so  you cant be a providence and not be a bore says one of the good women plainly enough to him but if his interlocutors are bored what must his readers be  for not content with writing out all these subtly incoherent conversations at length he sometimes interrupts them for four or five pages on end to explain the portentous signification which his imagination sees in a droop of the lips or a movement of the hand the book ends up with a conversation of about one hundred pages with mrs brissenden it takes place in the drawingroom after twelve when most of the ladies have gone to bed and the servants have been squared another subtle and characteristic touch of smart society to leave the lights on as a result of this terribly improper conference in the full blaze of the electric light it appears that not only is mr jamess  theory incorrect anyhow but that it is absolutely gratuitous as the fact which it should have explained is not a fact for long turns out to be as great an ass as ever the whole book is an example of hypochondriacal subtlety run mad the characters in the book are simple stupid english people direct and comparatively uninteresting and  mr james becomes simply a bore besides being vulgar in his absurd attempt to read into them subtle conditions of soul of which they are totally incapable  fiction the sacred fount by henry james heinemann 6s had anyone but mr james written this book his admirers might well have cried  oh tis sacrilege but since mr james himself is the author what can we say but that he has in his own brilliantly tedious way with his own inimitable art and with his own occult knowledge of what the lifting of an eyebrow or the movement of a back may meansucceeded triumphantly in an elaborate satire on himselfthat is on his own obsession  everybody knows what mr jamess obsession is and after achieving the last page of this volume it is evident to us that mr james also knows with him as with the character without a name who tells the story the vision of life is an obsession to him for real excitement  there are no such adventures as the intellectual ones  in every word or action of his fellowcreatures he perceives motives that like the lines on a railway siding have no beginning and no end mr james has never carried his analysis of the daintily unimportant further than in the sacred fount and never before to our knowledge has he after incredible labour with bricks of gossamer and mortar of sunbeams blown down the dainty edifice with such a goodhumoured series of puffs the last page brings a vision of mr henry james stepping forward and saying with a profound obeisance   you perceive how prodigiously i know myself the sacred fount we may say without more ado is youth the theme of the book is the hypothesis that youth has the power to rejuvenate and vivify age but at the cost of the oozing away of the sap of youth from itself but mr james is not a believer in his own theory or only to a certain extent he turns tail he allows his speculations to be derided and the end is more smoke than fire or perhaps it would be fairer to say that he uses his hypothesis merely as a means of showing to what prodigious lengths the analytical mind can go it is as if the princess in the fairy tale from the suggestion of the presence of the pea beneath her mattress had created a market garden of flowering shrubs the pea represents the cell from which mr james as master nurseryman has produced his garden of exotics a day and an evening cover the period of the story which passes at newmarch a country house of liberal ease and delightful appurtenances there a few choice guests are gathered among them is the narrator with his passion for embroidering on things and his genius for seeing a hundred complex reasons behind a cursory remark or a chance movement the way you get hold of things says mrs brissenden sometimes she is called mrs briss  is positively uncanny it is here is an example of just how much the nameless narrator we must restrain ourselves from the temptation of identifying him with mr james sees in a glance something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to hi in at the house he had met his wife she had in 8 me way dealt with him he had beeu with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him we have not space to quote the many things this rontgenrayeyed guest saw in mrs brissendens back but we can assure the reader that a page of the book does not cover them his awakening is due to mrs brissenden she patiently refuses to play the part of a pretty fly refuses to walk into the parlour to put a pretty copingstone to his palace of gossamer instead she fires her bright artillery at him and the concussion shakes down the palace of gossamer he has been elaborating his theories at infinite length and her comments are   how can i tell please what you consider youre talking about    you see too much    you talk too much    you overestimate the penetration of others     youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build upyou build up houses of cards are we extravagant in suggesting that this is mr henry james in a grimly humorous mood turning his analytical mind on himself the skill of the story is enormous  the triumph of its artistic presentment is indisputable only mr james could have written it so much we grant willingly but since an authors power of being able to interest his reader in his story as story must depend on the temperament and predilection of the reader we will give our personal verdict by slightly modifying one of mr jamess own locutions the narrator in the pause that follows some remarks he has made to mrs brissenden thus soliloquises oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it we would saythe transposition is slight oh how intensely we didnt like having to read our way to the very end of the sacred fount if mr james hadnt so handsomely put into it all his delicate talent and thus illumined the tediousness of the story we should not only have made a wry face but yawned ourselves away to the company ofwell of john silver or captain kettle	englishfiction

B6468	"['6850397', '9023455']"	  the whirlwind fiction by eden phillpotts chapman  hall 6s mr phillpotts is at his best in this his latest novel which made its first appearance in the pages of the fortnightly review his standard is a high one his method is conceived on a large scale it is no other than to bring all the aspects of naturethe changing sky with its range of colours the wind that blows across his devon moors the trees the flowers the animals all the denizens of earthinto league with him in telling one great story of passion or love or disaster his human characters emerge from this great background  first you see the village of lydford nestling quietly in a nook of the wide moorthen the farmhouse ruddyford and the old peat mine the place in which his chief characters live and gradually the chief characters themselves stand out from their fellow villagers and over them something of the eternal greatness of things is thrown something which comes from the greatness of their setting in the carrying out of this conception he brings great skill to bear but the result is not on the level of the intention if it were so mr phillpottss work would take a high place in english literature a place above that of thomas hardy there is something lacking there is an element of disappointment for though his descriptions of natural scenery and events are vivid and at times beautiful though his grip on his characters never relaxes and their doings are always interesting yet the two are never moulded into shape by a view of things the scope of which is sufficiently wide to present one allembracing outlook each remains separate there is no dominant idea which would create the requisite unity in design this defect is noticeable in  the whirlwind though the story is one which never fails to hold the attention and to hold it strongly in isolated detailfor example in the character of hilary woodrow a remarkably subtle study or in the character of sarah jane a magnificent woman or in many descriptions of moorland scenery and of superb happenings in the heavensmr phillpotts has done nothing better but there is a lack of inevitability about the final tragedy and that lack lends to the tragedy an element of sordidness which is belittling great art takes facts which may be in themselves brutal and by its magic touch raises them above themselves by showing that which lies beyond every fact and the beauty which is a part of all suffering this transforming touch is absent from  the whirlwind as it is absent from all mr phillpottss work and its absence prevents his work rising to the high place which the excellence of his actual writing his knowledge of humanity his love of nature would otherwise command  the whirlwind by eden phillpotts  chapman  hall mr phillpotts has come to be recognised as a writer with a sense of the underlying tragedy of life his irony is in a manner sophoclean and he is fond of dealing in primary emotions and with simple psychological problems in this way he undoubtedly gets near the earth  that  good red earth  he loves on dartmoor at one time moving strongly under the influence of mr hardy he had a derivative air  but that has faded and he is now himself and indeed pursues his own course with individuality he has chosen to abide by dartmoor and by dartmoor he stands or falls he brings to it an indeterminable love and a corresponding sympathy the very humours of the moor one feels affect his moods as they affect some of his characters his tales now take the impress of the moor with its gloom its starkness and its dignity this one is the tragedy of a peasant couple daniel brendon and sarah jane friend sarah is the daughter of the moors as brendon is a aeon of them her father is the caretaker of abandoned peatworks in a desolate place and these have eaten their way into his spirit he lives and talks in peat from his solitary cottage arises the tall fair saxon fullbosomed woman with a frankness beyond ordinary and a compelling beauty the giant brendon with his slowmoving wits is attracted by her and so are others but her choice is brendon a godfearing jealous farmlabourer with a strange unwholesome and neurotic master this latter woodrow who is rather unconvincingly represented as something of a misogynist succumbs to the wife of his servant and persistently woos her it is never made clear to us why or how he wins her if it was because she thought to advance her husbands interests then it was not like sarah jane nor is the supposition consistent with her subsequent attitude to woodrow we are forced back upon the suggestion that she was in love with two men at the same time to which we demurin the womans case at any rate however it is obvious by this time that mr phillpotts is marching fast on tragedy and owing to the meanness of an old admirer sarahs tragedy deveiopes quickly the slow fires of the passive brendon awake and break into flame in the end we leave him in the salvation army uniform though the date of the story is fifty years back it mill be seen that while mr phillpotts runs the risk as often of falling into melodrama he keeps himself out of that pit by the artistry of his handling and the dignity of his characterization in playing with heroic issues he never descends to bathos and the conclusion satisfies poetic justice if it wrings the tender heart	englishfiction
B2250	"['4372131', '9428028', '8485575']"	  reviiws of books our mutual frien mr dickens has now been so long before the public and his name is associated with so many triumphs some of which were achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born that he has already obtained the position of a classic and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time he has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood the collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes the characters he has invented would almost people a town and we might well excuse an author who has done so much if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time but mr dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having outwritten himselfl his fancy his pathos his hmour his wonderful powers of observation his picturesqueness and his versatility are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago in some respects they are seen to still greater advantage the energy of youth yet remains but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years not that we mean to say mr dickenshas outgrown his faults they are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard a certain extr vagnce in particular scenes and personsa tendency to caricature and grotesquenessand a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic as if the author had been considering how the thiqwroulld  tell  on the stageare to be found in  our mutual fried as in all this great novelists productions but when a writer of genius has fully settled his style and maintained it through a core

that in rgaina our mutual friend from month to month we cared very little as to what became of old harmons property excepting in asrfares the ultimate disposal of that sordid aggregation of wealth affectd the development of two or three of the chief characters theind explanation is a disappointment the whole plot in which the deceased harmon boffin wegg and john rokeemith are concerned is wild and fantastic wanting in reality and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story mr dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection for in the very interesting  postscript in lieu of preface which he has appended to the second volume he says there is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact therefore i note here though it may not be at al necessay that there are hundreds of will cases as they are called far more remarkable than that fancied in this book and that the stores of the prerogative office teem with instances of testators who have made changed contradicted hidden forgotten left cancelled and leftuncancelled each many more wills than were ever made by the elder mr harmon of harmony jail we do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact and it is not to the terms of mr harmons will that we object but to the circumstances flowing from that source that the son john harmon known through the greater part of the book as john rokesmith should come baok to gland under the circunstances related should disappear as related should live for months at the house of his childhoods friends the boffins without being discovered and should then be suddenly found out without any sucint explanation that mr boffin should

her we venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up the termination of mr dickenss novels is often hurried and such is the case in the present instance the complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process but is so to speak roughly tonne open and even before we are half through the book the mystery concerning john rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner young rokesmith or harmon tells himself his own previous history in a sort of mental soliloquy in which a long series of events is minutely narrated evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader it is surprising that so experienced a romancewriter as mr dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design yet notwithstanding these defects which we have pointed out with the greater freedom because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic the story of  our mutual friend is interesting for its own sake even apart from its treatment which we need not say is that of a master if we except these points already objected to we repeat what we said at the commencementthat in conception and evolution of character and in power of writing this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw considered on artistic grounds are eugene wrayburn lizzie hexam bradley headstone and bella wilfer the first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature originally noble degenerating under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness into a laughing indifference to all things worthyinto a gay and sportive disbelief in itself in manhood in womanhood and in the world from first to last the conception is wonderfully developed and the change that is afterwards wrought in eugenes disposition is worked out without the smallest violence in strong contrast with the goodnatured levity of wrayburn is the stern selfcontained narrow yet within its contracted and mechanical limits earnest nature of bradley headstone the selfeducated schoolmaster liue hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact she is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can getdead bodies among the restand who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess the girl  however is a fine sensitive being handsome and of a deep tender nature and when eugene wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver he takes an interest in her fate and has her educated his interest deepens into love yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage bradley headstone also is in love with lizzie and the way in which his impassive artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love jealousy and some pungent taunts which wrayburn gaily flings at him is exhibited by mr dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness the transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark haggard selftormenting evil genius per tually dogging the steps of eugene wrayburn and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river is one of the finest things in fiction bradley headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest and we are peruaded of the profoundest truth natures like his originally cold and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of selfcontrol mr dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of bradley headstones wrath in the attempted murder of eugene all the preparations for that at and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions are managed in mr dickenss highest style and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness we are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake of nature to which novelists should be superior that this carcter is sensational  but the genius that could conceive it has dothilg to fear from such objectors very touching and beautifsl the character of lizzie hexam but probably the greatest favourite in the book will beor rather is alreadybella wilfer she is evidently a pet of the authors and she will long r m the darling of half the households of england and america pererse petulant wil wrongheaded not a little inclined at first to be selfish and aneyloving she is yet a bewitching little creare and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak they are so numerous but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of betty higden and little johnny her gre andchild that the poor old creatures pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from mr dickens in the final words from which we have already quoted a declaration of his views on the present administration of the poor laws  in my social experiences since mrs betty higden came upon the scene and left it i have found circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the poor law my friend m1r bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and i have been called upon to admit that i would give poor law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow patting this nonsense aside i have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some union houses the other admitting that there are such pcor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do the records in our newspapers the late exposure by the lancet and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences but that my view of the poor law may not be amk or misrepresented i will state it i believe there has been in england since the days of the stuarts no law so often infimously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised in the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanityand known language could say no more of their lawlessnes we must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls dressmaker fantastic and semipoetical yet with a deep instinct of truth her drunken fathera sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein mr dickens is quite unrivalled bellas father a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature the podsnaps and veneerings and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers male and female by whom they are surroundedportraits admirable for the social satire they embody rogue riderhood and some of the other hangerson about the river we might almost mention the river itself as a character it plays a most important part in the story and always with great picturesqueness we cannot refain ere we conclude from referring once more to the postscript for the sake of its allusion to an event in whidh at the time we were all deeply interested on friday the 9th of june in the present year mr and do

afford to lose such a writer as mr dik a man of original creative genius dying in the fulnes of bis strength leaves a gap which nothing can fill and a regt which the memory of his past triumphs only deepens and embitter  our mutual friend by charles dickens with illustrations by marcus stone 2 vols chapman  hall a new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture or of qualification for a simple yet serious reason those who with understanding as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise have followed mr dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him carelesswhether as concerns his art his public or himself as little have they spoilt or dimmed or turned aside his quick sympathies his power of minute observation his keen desire to advocate what he deems right his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success the boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture but may he not ponder too long and oversolicitously  this question we fancy may be asked with respect to  our mutual friend only the other day ita author gave us that french story of little bebelle one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with sternes shandyisms only yesterday out of a dingy street in the strand from no more promising place than a lodginghouse the artist by a touch brought to light a homely loving fellowcreature worthy to  sit above the salt among the best of the best mrs lirriperas real  a being of the mind  as mr pickwick as mrs gamp as the micaivbersas any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist whom we know intimately in all their strength and weakness and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words if therefore we say that during its course of fragmentary publication  our mutual friend has raised more question than certain of its predecessors the circumstance arises from the nature of the story and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion none of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale it would be wasted labour to detail or analyse a chain of events which every one has already handled enough to state our conviction that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links from the first number it was evident to us that the murdered john harmon was not murdered but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will for the purpose of testing her real nature the circumstances of the deed which led to his shipmate radfoot being mistaken for and murdered with himself are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity some incompleteness referable to partial recollection may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelists partmay belong to the nature of the catastrophe but it produces an impression of uncertainty then again the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises which bear unfavourably on some of the characters we fancy the conversion of bella wilfer the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister to be somewhat too suddeneven though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing mr boffin this avarice again however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared has of necessity implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched the honest truthful boffin of the mounds whose simple rightmindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of bella the oddlydesignated bride ofthe great fortune but his inability to carry such a longdrawn piece of subtle comedy through we beg respectfully to our great novel ist to question and we are satisfied that bo greathearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever or any desire to lead on a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with wegg after the discovery of old harmons second mil in the house of the anatomical curiositymonger that which belongs and befits a detective policeman apt at disguises as mr bucket of nevertobeforgotten memory sits ill on an honest ignorant affectionate creature such as he is and though we love mrs boffin the comfortable and instinctivelydelicate woman one of mr dickenss most genial creations with all our hearts we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance truth and nature are here strained in subservience to the requirements of literary art we fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story harmon its hero is by his position betwixt light and dark inevitably partially effaced bella the coquetish daughter of mrs wilfer the stupendous is capitally touched in the chameleon hues of her character and royally righted at last but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring then lizzie hexam though not precisely a sketch has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the readers interest lastly we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy humble affectionate and beneficent as riah the hebrew on any grounds of compact obligation or sophistry lending himself one hour after it was known to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as fledgeby the usurer the meanest creature this is saying much as yet created by the hand that painted the moneylenders in  nickleby and brats and kroolc and fagin and uriah heep the explanation made by him at last to the little weird dolls dressmaker shows us that mr dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation which is insufficient to convince us we cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness somewhat similar in miss edgeworths  ormonda tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom  every man has his hand thus much by way of qualificationor call it speculation ratherconcerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without stop let or hindrance on returning to the characters that of bradley headstone the schoolmaster dogged sensual unreadyhis tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position takes the foremost place among them as an original conception frightfully though he suffers even though when he confronts wrayburn his pococurante rival there is a show of reason and of championship on his side there is no possibility of any ones feeling a moments pity on his behalf so utterly is the masterdesire of his life rendered unlovable by the forms in which it is clad there have been many murders and many pictures of remorse in novelsand none more powerful than the pages in which we were shown the wanderings of bill sykes and the slinking home of jonas chuzdewit after his bloody deed in the wood but mr dickens has exceeded even those in the scene where the wretched criminal tortured by the rebuking consciousness of his having failed in his diabolical design is dogged and dragged back to the fatal spot by his nideous confidant nothing can be mon masterly as a display of blank inevitable retri j bution and wretchedness redeeming touch  there is none about bradley headstone  even j the concealed

they say on the stage boots and brewerare all new people in print whom every dinerout has met every  week of his life in private the vivacity and  variety of this division of the novel are admirable but when talking of dinners in our mutual friend we nuit not forget the most  incomparable dinner of all that of the newly  married couple bella and john at greenwich for the sake of the sentimental

milveysclergyman and clergymans wife lxth so unconscious in their selfsacrificing virtue and goodness yet the two so capitally discriminated by the extra touch of zeal and briskness and suspicion of the jews on the womans part it might be suggested that too much space is given to the impostorcouple the lammles and their designs on podsnaps poor foolish little daughter but again how capitally thrown in to the womans part is its scrap of shame and of remorseful feeling her figure ere she quits the scene unconsciously sketching on the tablecloth with her parasol is not to be forgotten as marked by that attitude and occupation enough then has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded and to prove that on its being read and read again every lover of types of human character every student of art in fiction every man who has  humour in his soul will find each and all enjoyment if as regards broad outline there are former stories by mr dickens which we preferif among his tales we rank the highest  david copperfield which includes so to say neither plot nor surpriseour mutual friend must be signalised for an accumulation of fine exact characteristic detail such as would suffice to set up in trade for life a score of the novelspinners wno give us situations without motives scenes without characters words without thoughts and the dialogue not of real life but of melodrama  the literary examiner our mutual friend by charles dickens with illus trations by marcus stone in two volumes chapman and hall latinised races accuse english writers of a disregard of unity in works of art and yet there is no great english work of imagination that does not recognise it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action we rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time and although we recognise even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot but a wellharmonized relation of all parts to one central thought ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based every great english work of imagination every good work of art all the world over is as it were a crystallisation of though	
 about some one central idea nowhere perhaps is the sense of this true unity so perfectly shown as in the literature of england in shakespeare grave or gay it is distinctly seen every turn of the light trifling in loves labours lost every character of the play blends with the rest in a poets graceful jest over the taste of his day for idle ornament in the plot nothing is done all the ingenious rhyming of the courtiers agrees with the state of don armado with the j brave outside who being called upon to strip to his shirt and fight owns that he has not a shirt to his back under all his bravery in the merchant of venice the play crystallises round the central thought of the relation between justice and mercy law and gospel in king lear earthly sovereignty breaks like a bubble on the wind as it flies through the stir of the grand forces of nature in julius casar the central thought is the problem of government the supreme sovereignty of caesar the philosophical republicanism of brutus the selfseeking republicanism of cassius and all other parts of the play show as it were the different faces of the crystal of which all parts have their harmonious relation to the single point of thought if we turn from shakespeare to fielding in tom jones broad as the canvas is on which that work is painted and crowded as it is with various incident there also we find every detail tending to ono centre the idea of the relation of man to society jones and biifil are types of the two opposite halves of the social world jones faulty but honest his faults open and incurring blame biifil keeping the faults of a worse nature secret giving a fair show to the worst acts and escaping blame in the relation of man with society open truth is contrasted with false seemiog and the episode of the old man of the hill is contrived to provide for the middle case of the man who cuts the knot of tiie social problem by avoiding conversation with his fellows mr dickens invariably fulfils in his novels this condition of deep seated unity which has been always recognised in english art all readers can feel that he does so and some readers who have paid little attention to good literature have raised thereupon arguments upon the propriety or impropriety of  writing with a purpose as tf any thing worth reading anything worth seeing anything worth hearing were ever produced or uttered without the purpose to express a distinct individual meaning of some sort there must be in every good novel play or poem one true thought for the mainspring that keeps all ita wheels in action and we must start from the mainspring if we would trace properly the movement of the works in this novel of our mutual friend the argument is of the soul of life smong the fictions of society we are shown in the first chapter lizzie hexam a truehearted girl in a position as degraded as imagination can conceive without stain to her inner purity she is bringing a pure heart to a revolting way of life ber father supports a wretched home among scum of the riverside by fishing for drowned men in this girl chiefly but not in her only we are as the story grows to see the radiance of the aoul of life we turn from her and the deep social degradation of her outward life at onoe in the second chapter to the other side of the books argument the fictions of society these are typified throughout by the friends collected round the dinnertable of the veneering the veneering themselves have their root in nothing being social jonahs gourds under whose leaves leaves of a dinnertable prophets of society extend

of developmentour literature does not contain a happier study of light girlish grace advancing with no loss of charms into a pure womanly earnestness bella when young believes that she is sordid she has come out of a mean home into the daily relish of what wealth can buy is guest and friend of mr and mrs boffin social nobodies who happen for a time to sit on the gold heap with homely honest hearts that love of gold can never spoil then the boffins join with bellas lover to whom really all the gold belongs in plot for the girls education and the fetching out of the true soul of life known to be in her boffin covers himself with gloryand much mystifies the reader of the novel by appearing in the character of a man spoilt by wealth and turned into a greedy miser everybody knows how the story runs and so we need not describe at length or quote any of its passages we would only show that in this central plot also of our mutual friend as in the outlying incidents connected with it the inner thought of the book ia still the same is of the soul of life greater than all the fictions of society to this design belongs the sharp contrasting of such characters as mr and mrs boffin and mr and mrs lammle the story of the strong heart of betty higden who showed qualities of heroism in avoidance of the workhouse  the weak intellect with malice and greedy cunning in fledgeby the weaker intellect with love and the tender spirit of selfsacrifice in sloppy how full of a quaint generous humour again is the sketch of the dolls dressmaker little miss wren with her broken back and feeble frame her precocious wit sharpened by trouble in which the spirit of childhood casts its golden threads across the dull woof of her life of care and whose kindliness is at times touched with a malice as of childish playfulness familiar with bitter years of trouble nobody who reads this book as a whole can fail to be struck with the ingenious arrangement and skilfnl conduct of the story bead piecemeal it was satisfactory only to those who had faith in their author the secret of mr boffins little plot is so well kept that while it was in action they who believed their old friend to be shown to them ss really spoilt by wealth believed unwillingly and sometimes may have rashly supposed that here the masters hand had lost its cunning in fact if we look back to those scenes in which mr boffin enacted the part of a miser we shall be surprised to see how skilfully and freely the novelist scattered what with the key to it all in our possession we see clearly enough to be indications of the true state of the case the wealth of wit poured over all the pages of this book would be an intellectual harmons estate large enough to set on horseback every wegg of a literary gentleman with a wooden head we may say if we will that here we like and there we dont like any character or passage but far above desire to criticise by the small way of personal comparison between our individual tastes and opinions and those bf our author is the keen enjoyment of bis genius and after all there is the strictest justice in the heartiest appreciation of a liveliness of fancy that spends all its

and the two negroes had lieen saved from the wreck by the fortunate appearance of the frigate mr witherington of finsbury square was sitting alone in his diningroom wondering what could have become of the circassian and why he had not received intelligence of her arrival mr witherington as we said before was alone lie had his port and his sherry before him and although the weather was rather warm there was a small lire in the grate because as mr witherington asserted it looked comfortable mr witherington having watched the ceiling of the room for some time although there was certainly nothing new to be discovered filled another glass of wine and then proceeded to make himself more comfortable by unbuttoning three more buttons of his waistcoat pushing his wig farther hack ofthis bead and casting loose all the buttons tit the knees of his breeches he completed his arrangements by dragging towards him two chairs within his reach putting his legs upon one while he rested his arm upon the other and why was not mr witherington to make himself comfortable he had good health a good conscience and eight thousand iyear     as mr witherington senior had always studied comfort his son had early imbibed the same idea and carried his feelings in that respect to a much greater excess he divided things into comfortable and uncomfortable one line day lady mary witherington alter paying all the household bills paid the debt of nature that is she died her husband paid the undertakers bill so it is to be presumed that she was buried mr witherington senior shortly uftnvarls had a stroke of

square mr witherington considered this a comfortable income and he therefore retired altogether from business during the lifetime of lus parents he had been witness to one or two matrimonial scenes which had induced him to put down matrimony as one ol the things not comfortable therefore lie remained a bachelor his sister moggy also remained unmarried  but whether it were from a very unprepossessing squint which deterred suitors or from the same dislike to matrimony as her brother had imbibed it is not in our power to say mr witherington was three years younger than his sister and although he had for some time worn a wig it was only because he considered it more comfortable mr witheringtons whole character might lie summed np in two wordseccentricity and benevolence eccentric he certainly was as most bachelors usually are man is but a rough pebble without the attrition received from contact willi the gentler sex  it is wonderful how the ladies pumice a man down into a

the specimens we shall give of captain marryatexcept one of his neat reflections  poor men unfortunately always make love better than those who tyre rich because having less to care about and not being pulled up with their own consequence they are not so selfish and think minti more of the lady than of themselves voting ladies also who fall in love never consider whether there is snflicient to make the pot boilprobably because young ladies in love lose their appetites and not feeling inclined to eat at that time they imagine that love will always supply the want of food we have intimated

B8458	['9452121']	  mrs hallibwiorfs troubles by mr henry wood 3 vols bentley mrs henry avood has lost no time in producing a third novel it is not likely that writing at this extravagant rate she can keep up her reputation to the standard expected from the author of east lynne and we are not surprised to find  mrs halliburtons troubles little better than a repetition of the channings the plot is to all intents and purfloses the same we have the two large fannies  one poor industrious and despised the other proud worthless and fraudulent the halliburtons being the good family end in success and prosperity the dares on the other hand come to ruin and disgrace to suppose that this must always be the case is a mistake the spectacle of vice overthrown and virtue triumphant is we fear moro often to be met with in novels than in everyday life in this wicked world of ours the subject has become hackneyed and scarcely serves to create any powerful interest in a mere fictitious story it has been truly said that two gifts are required in order to write a good book  to know what to say and what to withhold no one knows what to say better than mrs wood in the latter gift she seems to be a little deficient the many chapters on glovemakers would have been better withheld  the domestic quarrels and drunken brawls of honey fair are true enough no doubt we all know of similar neighbourhoods in every large town we read of such scenes every day in thc papers in a tract or even in a work on political economysuch subjects might be fitly handled and turned to good account in a novel they are wearisome and out of place breaking the thread of the story and having very little connexion with the plot the scene of mrs halliburtons troubles is laid at helstonleigh the same old cathedral town in which the channings resided mrs halliburton in the first half of the book goes down hill in every chapter she loses her parents and her husband and her little girl affording scope for three deathbed scenes in the first volume and a half she finds herself without means of support friendless and alone in the city of helstonleigh  and being unable to pay her rent an execution is put into the house this brings her misery to a climax the dares begin by defrauding the halliburtons of their half of the fortune left by a mutual uncle they afterwards oppress and persecute them in many ways the boys all go to the college school and the dares cut the halliburtons call them snobs and attack them in the streets whenever they can get an opportunity william halliburton and cyril dare are fellowapprentices at a great glovemanufactory and of course the contrast in their conduct is always strongly marked we have the same old incident of a missing cheque and the dares try hard to prove that young halliburton has stolen it but finding that cyril dare is himself the culprit the matter is instantly hushed up by this time the halliburton star has begun to dawn on them jane obtains employment as a glovemaker from her landlord mr ashley who takes also great interest in her sons the young halliburtons are so superior in manners and education to the other college boys that their mother is requested to take pupils of an eveningand when her lodger a rich and kindhearted old lady dies the widow takes in boarders and keeps a kind of  dames house in connexion with the college the older they grow the more the young halliburtons rise in the world and the dares fall in proportion idle worthless and extravagant they get into every kind of scrape they owe money and they endorse bills they gamble and drink and quarrel and cheat andi lie anthony hos an intrigue with one of the gloveresses in honey fair and herbert flirts with his sister s italian governess and with a pretty little quaker girl who lives next door to mrs halliburton the italian is jealous and revengeful the quakeress confiding and simple and so far this part of the story is interesting and well managed william halliburton advises his pretty neighbour to have nothing to say to herbert dare and threatens to tell her father the glovers foreman of her evening walks with her worthless admirer henry ashley the mastermanufacturers only son a cripple from his birth also confides to williamhislove for anna lynn the little quakeress and as henry is allowed to indulge every whim that seizes him he is never happy without william halliburton who spends much of his spare time with his excitable but afflicted friend and becomes secretly attached to mary ashley his masters daughter william in time rises to be a junior partner in the business thereby cutting out cyril dare who aspires to this post as well as to the hand of mary ashley next after a violent dispute with his brother herbert anthony dare is found one night murdered and herbert is committed for trial on suspicion and awaits the assizes in helstonleigh jail he would have been pronounced guilty had not the timid modestlooking little quakeress stepped forward and proved an alibi just at the critical moment he could not have murdered his brother at their own home for he was passing the evening with her in the field at the back of her fathers house so herbert is acquitted but anna lynn loses her good name and her father has a stroke of paralysis and herbert finds helstonleigh unpleasantand obtains a situation abroad where he is followed by the italian governess who is in fact the murderess having intended to give the false herbert merely a gentle stab on his return from his visit to anna lynns she in the dark attacks anthony by mistake and as he happened to come in drunk and incapable he fell on the dagger and was killed on the spot very little regretted by helstonleigh in general the one redeeming point in herberts character is his honourable conduct towards anna lynn rather than cast a shadow of scandal on her good name he steadily refuses to tell any human being where he was on the evening of the murder and this is the only good trait evinced by any one member of the dare family the expose of pretty annas conduct causes henry ashley an agony of grief and a violent illness ensues from which he returns to his ordinary life a sadder and a wiser man and he helps william in his schemes for the improvement of honey fair which is chiefly brought about by collecting the men together after working hours and giving them a comfortable room to sit in good books to read pleasant little lectures and above all friendly sympathy without which latter ingredient no movement for the reformation of hon 3y fairs will ever be of the slightest avail the last chapter brings the halliburtons to the height of prosperity and the dares to the lowest degree of humiliation the dares wish they were all dead and mr ashley helps them oft to australia and the halliburtons have a grand triumphant finale mr ashley is high sheriff for the county and entertains in great state  her majestys justices of assize  his daughter now mrs william halliburton being unconsciously admired by mr justice keene mrs halliburton looking quiet and ladylike in a grey silk gown sits on a sofa and flirts with the bishop the great merit of the book is the true and simple manner in which every scene and character are depicted they may be all living human beings for aught we know to the contrary the bad are perhaps a little too bad they are seen always on the worst side and the good again are drawn like queen elizabeth with no shadows at all but still they are real and we know them and believe in them and take an interest in them and though the story is long and not always lively we are compelled to read on to the end and to see the last of the halliburtons the moral and religious principles inculcated are unexceptionable	englishfiction

B6463	"['6675705', '6786089', '3173733', '8875503']"	  ficti ion sons of the morning by eden phillpotts methuen 6s we have ere now frankly expressed our conviction that mr phillpotts is a writer of exceptional gifts we have also noted his tendenoy towards mere excitation sons of the morning is a novel which bears out both our encomium and our disparagement it is finely written it has some of the qualities of a stately nature poem but its function is  mere excitation at first the book seems to offer an interesting problem in human affairs honour endicott loves two men of contrasting temperaments at the same time and in the same way we are accustomed to the situation when the person whose affections are divided is a man but a woman of this sort of versatility is a little uncommon and in devonian scenery with pious rustics babbling around her more than a little piquant one asks whether the heroines dual passion will make her a genius or a mad woman a social iconoclast or a saint but mr phillpotts simply cuts the gordian knot shaking nrieti s revive at the stroke of death but the reader ps we have here touched the salient spot of improbability as well of futility in a volume that is by no means deficient in that ingredient there are in it things far more extraordinary than the death of a husband by a fall but it may be said with perfect truth that to sustain conviction in a story it is necessary that all catastrophes of fundamental importance should seem as well as be inevitable great writers successfully compel the illusion that they are mouthpieces of reality mr phillpotts is self betrayed as the mouthpiece of mr phillpotts it is so in the conclusion of lying prophets it is so in sons of the morning and yet his cunning is indisputable he can write lyric prose and make his beautiful devon live in a manner that causes one to feel that whatever their misfortunes his two lovers were veritable  sons of the morning it has been said that merely to insert marry come up is a step towards creating the illusion of an historical romance so too does a word like toadflax help to create the illusion of a country romance mr phillpotts has planted his characters on real soil the sense of growth and space is over his story and he can use rightly the names of many wild things besides toadflax strong is he too on the side of local colour his witch is a fine invention though the machinery of the story would creak less if he had never reverted to oil of man his rustics who revolve about honour as mr hardys did about bathsheba a greater creation are always amusing this is the way in which churdles administers consolation to the father of a stillborn babe  beggin your pardon theers a gert lesson to such a trouble if a body cant be tu stiffnecked

at sight of waterns crest now dark against the flaming sky he remembered that there lay the scene of stapletons end and regretted that he had come within sight of it that night to him the distant mountain was a theatre of tragedy to honor an altar of saorifioe the hero and heroine are each the last of a line the final fruit of an ancient stock methuen 6s  sons of the morning by eden philpotts 6s methuen mr philpotts is in danger of taking himself and his work too seriously this tendency only too marked in 1 children of the mist is still plainer in  sons of the morning we confess to having found much of mr philpotts new novel sadly wanting in attraction and brightness it contains not a little excellent writing nothing could be more humorous than the rustic scenes while the descriptive work is good though there is too much of it but failure is in the central figures they are stiff and unreal not convincing enough to win our sympathy besides to make matters worse the story never ends it simply breaks off leaving the heroine in blank despair true she deserved her fate but that is small consolation for the reader a woman of a type happily abnormal she was violently in love with two men at the same time hence of course complications follow which we do not propose to reveal if the reader chooses to unravel them he will be rewarded by some diverting studies of devonshire yokels in which mr philpotts returns to his old saner merrier self the problem novel may not yet have had its day but the problem novel without a real problem certainly has  sons of the morning by eden phillpotts methuen  co ix spite of certain attempts at preciosity and a too obvious searching after strenuous words this author has a vivid style and a powerful grasp alike of human nature and the moods and phases of what in comparison we class as inanimate it is a pity there should be this tendency to mannerism that words like dislimn and  hypeethral should appear in contrast to such grovelling modernisms as  a wage because without them the descriptive passages would run the smoother and no discord would interfere with our enjoyment of such wordpictures as those of seor circle and watern tor the moods and phases of dartmoor have seldom been better described and the scenic setting is ever appropriate to the action of the drama which is played by the dwellers in and around bear

skill myles is a com plete contrast to the young squire grave sensible and anxious he is a man with depths and heights of feeling unintelligible to the aesthetic but rather shallow nature which soon suspects him as a rival honour partly appreciates himso far indeed that when taxed with her lingering love for the squire who has departed in a moment of generosity to leave the coast clear she

constrained him to fight to the last such is the real key to this very clever novel it is perhaps the most finished of mr levers as to plot the nominal hero is one f his stock charactersa man of the world who has been everywhere seen and done everything always losing everything and always tumbling on his feet again in some extraordinary manner we cannot take much interest in him he resembles a civilised hawkeye if hewas new he would be very good but we have seen his double too often before however he fills up space uncommonly well and his adventures give opportunity for some capital descriptions and little bits of worldiyadvicejwhich come from no one better than the author of  harry lorrequer a party intrigue to get an octogenarian judge to resign would not seem a very promising basis for a novel which was to appear by instalments in a popular magazine yet few could pass a scene with baron lendrick and not wish to know whether he was ultimately triumphant over courts cabals and an unscrupulous press true there is much to be said for his enemies his incredible vanity tempted attack but the sharpness of his tongueand we not only read about bis wit bnt can enjoy itooa pat down the assailants the reality of his danger makes the contest perilous enough to interest whilst the extreme inferiority of the dogs which would beard the sick lion enlist all sympathy on one side only his generosity prevents his eating them up and though we see their footprints as they come out it is evident they have been sorely mauled varied attainments will always excite more varied if not more powerful envy and as the chief baron is alwaysin his old age at leastacute enough to appear only on his own grounds he could only be reached through the newspapers once indeed the lordlieutenant tried to see what he could do himself he fared as agamemnon would have done in the tent of achilles the host asserted every privilege and he told the story to his son who he used to say had inherited his temper but not his abilities in these words he twice rose to go away but on each occasion i had something to say that induced him to sit down again it was the whole case of ireland we reviewedthat is did i deployed the six millions before him and he took the salute yes sir education religious animosities landtenure drainage emigration secret societies the rebel priest and the intolerant parson even nationality and mendicant insolence all marched past and he took the salute   and now my lord said i  it is the man who tells you these things who has the courage to tell and the ability to display them and it is this man for whose retirement your excellency is so eager that you have actually deigned to make him a visit that he may carry away into the next world perhaps a pleasing memory of this it is this man i say whom you propose to replaceand by what my lord and by whom  will a mere lawyer will any amount of nisi prius craft or precedent give you the qualities you need on that bench or that you need sadly need at this councilboard  go back my lord and tell your colleagues of the cabinet that providence is more merciful than a premier and that the same overruling hand that has sustained me through this trial will uphold me i trust for years to serve my country and save it for some time longer from your blundering legislation that a man of such conceit as this at last falls a prey to some one who knows how to fool him to the top of his bent is a matter of course but there are many excuses for the blindness of sir william the villain of the tale is his own stepson separated from his wife and at issue with his son the old judge must fabricate for himself some kind of domestic lares his good dinners and what all who hear them for the first time admit them to be his good stories will provide him with listeners and flatterers for his evenings but he wants a majordomoa man who will make out his dinnerlist and see that his champagne is iced who can receive sir brook fossbrookes and doctor his horses in fact a primeminister whose head nevertheless is in every sense alwajs at his disposal but dudley sewell the man of forged acceptances and questionable racingbets is not to be governed altogether by even an irish chief baron and a possible peer it is a rich treat to see how he not only carves the judicial meat but rearranges the judicial wardrobe sir william is transformed into a  dandy of fifty who bows with a grace this deception does not last long but it is necessary in an artistic point of view the old man deserves a fall and even his best friends are glad to find he is not infallible meanwhile sir brook who ought to have been his most trusted friend is far away making his fourth or fifth fortune and of course spending it in daydreams before he has got it he comes back in triumph to find sir william as great as ever still demanding his peerage as the price of resignation but sobered by the recollection that he has at last given some ground for the accusation of senility at last he extorts the offerbut from the enemy he outlives the government which denies him justice and is too magnanimous to lend himself to the intrigues of their successors perhaps the incapacity of his heir may have something to do with his refusal and affection tempers pleasantly enough the last exhibition of intellectual conceit mr lever is rather too fond of letting ns know exactly what his characters like for their meals it is not that they are gluttons but we dont go to books of this class for a dietary though we might easily compile one from them the dialogue is sparkling the perpetual flavour of irishisms is not overdone and much as mr lever has written we doubt if he has ever told a less affected or a more wellwrought tale wo dont like the book the less because it appears without any grotesque illustrations like so many of the novels which are published by messrs blackwood and sons it is got up beautifully and will take a handsome place in any library long after thc first gloss is worn off by the thorough perusal its merits will ensure  sir brook fossbrookke there was a controversy some years ago between two wellknown periodicals upon the subject of lord lyttons novels one declaring its preference for his earlier the other for his later works however this may be there can be no doubt that mr levers productions are susceptible of a similar dispute for whilst they are all more or less based upon a similar plan of fiction their diction their colouring their construction have undergone from the first a gradual but marked modification this even to a careless observer was sufficiently apparent in  tony butler and in the story now before us it will be found confirmed  sir brook fossbrooke  we conceive to be one of the best of mr levers productions we cannot characterise it better than by the word clever it is essentially a clever novel moreover it exactly conforms to the true idea of the romance it supplies us with the precise entertainment that is expected to be found in fiction it is interesting and it is amusing excitement is offered without the violation of probability and it is eloquent without labour or artifice it is wholly destitute of those narratives of practical jokes and that eagerness to excite merriment which so retard the action of his earlier novels though the scene of the story is almost wholly laid in ireland the author has ver sensibly omitted all the hackneyed expletives of the conventional hibernian interlocutor there is only one  faix  in the book and what little irish

neighbourhood come sir brook fossbrooke and young trafford a subaltern in hms th casually meeting tom lendrick they are invited to his fathers house the swans nest and there he introduces them to his sister lucy the description given of sir brook fossbroope is excellent an old man who has combatted life in a multitude of shapes whose early years have been devoted to dissipation and who in his riper age yields himself up to abstract contemplations and scientific inquiries sir brook no sooner casts his eye upon lucy than he feels himself insensibly attracted towards her a resemblance to some cherished object in the past awakens in him a paternal affection and it may be said that from that moment he becomes the firm and faithful friend of the two young people nor is the impression made by lucy upon trafford less acute though with him it assumes a nature more romantic prior to his visit dr lendrick makes a journey to dublin to see his father who has been suddenly seized with a severe indispositiona fact that leads his warmhearted medical attendant dr beattie to believe a favourable moment has arrived to reconcile the father and son we are then introduced to sir william lendrick

honours the husband with a call and these encounters are generally marked with the profoundest courtesy on one side and the most eccentric politeness on the other the interview between the father and son results in this the old man requests him to allow lucy to live with him at his residence  the priory and further adds that he has the gift of an inspectorship of hospitals abroad which he offers

with all sorts of wild animals we began with deer antelopes and chamois and last night we got to wolves bears and tigers we were to have a most commodious shootingbox and invite parties to come and sport who instead of going to bohemia the rocky mountain and to africa would find all their savagery near home and pay us splendidly for the privilege there are some difficulties in the plan it is true our beasts might not be easy to keep within bounds the jaguar might make an excursion into the marketplace the bear might eat a butcher sir brook besides doubts if ferne could be preserved under the game laws he has sent a case to brewster for his opinion dont tell me of such absurdities said lendry trying to repress his quiet laugh  i want you to speak y and seriously i assure you sir we have the whole details of this on pap even to the cost of the beasts and the pensions to the widows of the keepers that may be devoured another plan that we had and it looked plausible enough too was to take oat a patent for a wonderful medical antidote as sir brook says there is nothing like a patent medicine to make a man rich and by good l1ck he i posd of the materialfor one he has the secret for curing the bite of the rattlesnake he got it from a tusoarora indian who i believe was a sort of fatherinlaw to him three applications of this to the wound have never been known to fail  but we

book the are admirably sketched but intensely repulsive characters colonel sewenl is an accomplished swindler of the worst type he fleeces or attem to fleece everybody he meets he is shown to us as a

bound with a sort of ecstasy yet this is the woman who is maltreated by her husband in the most atrocious manner once flogging her with his horsewhip once turning her out of the house in the dead of night and for ever muttering in her ear with white lips and trembling whisper words of cruel import yet whatever sympathy for her position her sex may compel from us we cannot help the edge being blunted by the despicable character that is disguised beneath an immaculate exterior  nor can we easily deny that all that she gets she very richly deserves however much we may detest the unmanly heart that dictates the chastisement this lady comes to the priory where she strikes up an intimacy with lucy lendrick who however does not entirely reciprocate her apparently friendly attention old sir william lendrick contemplates her with much satisfactionas much for her beauty as for the ease and gaiety of her manners subsequently the colonel ingratiates himself in the household and by much show of humility and assumption of profound respect for the judges wisdom succeeds in rendering himself endurable nevertheless the old man from certain motives fully disclosed before long significantly hints the departure of the gallant colonel and on the strength of this his mother lady lendrick rents the  swans nest  for him where in company with his wife and children he proceeds to ensconce himself he collects round him here through the medium of dinnerparties and brandy and water a number of officers whom he endeavours to swindle but to one of whom he is unfortunate enough to lose a thousand pounds this occurrence is described with great power and the unexpected presence of his wife who watches the players from the back of her husbands chair renders the whole scene singularly effective it is not our intention to enter into any further analysis of the plot believing that we have already said enough to disclose to the reader the nature of the volumes that await his perusal it is of a somewhat complex nature though uniform and consistent indeed strength is the chief characteristic of the story the interest is unflagging the incidents with which the narrative is enlivened being disposed with the nicest discrimiia ion one error however though on the right side which will be sufficiently obvious to an attentive reader we cannot pass over without comment the dialogues are almost all too brilliant from the epigrammatic point and polish with which they are contrived we miss the flow and ease of spontaneous conversation in such men as sir brook fossbrooke and the chief baron this might be thought reasonable but to make girls or men of mediocre intellect converse with the precision and point of matured elocutionists is to violate nature the dialogues in

less of artificial point as a fault apart from the artistic quality of the book may be mentioned a grievous solecism in taste which we regret mr lever should have fallen into baron lendrick is a

B1558	['8813773']	  a ruthless avenger by mrs conney 3 vols hutchinson  co mrs conney has put together a capital sensational romance on somewhat oldfashioned lines  a ruthless avenger is a story of virtue and villainy of crime and the tracking of crime of jewels and elopements of a coronet usurped recovered and thrown away but the author has not been satisfied with mere sensations and improbabilities she has done her best to make things follow each other in natural sequence and on adequate motives and for the most part she has heen successful more than once or twice when the reader recognises trite incidents and wellworn machinery a fresh turn is given to the development of the story which relieves it from banality here and there no doubt mrs conney is commonplace and melodramatic and she does not make the best of all her situations still her novel is quite above the average of its kind and is thoroughly entertaining	englishfiction

B4547	"['3191778', '6625339', '3168748', '8945669']"	  many inventions  the porcelain ladyl by frederick niven is a wellwritten and curiously attractive story of journalistic life as it revolves about a london newspaper office it is possible that there may be such a place as the weekly daily and hourly offices but it may be well to warn mr nivens readers that they are not to be found every day if they were all the world would be journalists if they could but if the life is somewhat idealised mr niven has given us a very pleasant picture of the camaraderie the sympathy and the unfailing helpfulness which exist between the men and women of the ready pen and the romance of john borough and ruth winter ends as it ought though  the porcelain lady has very little to do with it mr niven generally sustains a high level of writing it is all the more pity that he sometimes lapses into expressions inconsistent with the dignity of his work as might have been expected from so good a scholar and so distinguished a journalist as mr harold spender  the call of the siren  has many excellent qualities and his pictures of bath and the hills about it comb down and lansdowne the lanes through kelston and swainswick through which the children oliver and elsie martin wandered so happily have the authentic atmosphere there are many characters and many incidents not closely related so that the effect is sometimes confusing and the author at times leaves the reader unsatisfied how for instance did johnnie burrows know that olivers father was a thief whence came the rumour and having come how did it die out so suddenly  even olivers remarkable success in a cricketmatch would hardly have the effect of making schoolboys forget so sinister a rumour on the contrary his greater prominence would lend additional zest to their speculation but leaving apart such minor blemishes there is much that is excellent in the book though some pruning would have improved it and the chapter

orange baronet by the name of obrien an orangeman would no more be called obrien than he would kiss the popes toe the wild justice of revenge is exemplified in  the burnt house by christopher stone the widowed mrs tremayne still young and beautiful is obsessed with the desire to accumulate such evidence as will convict blagg a drunken tradesman of the malicious burning of her home to this end she employs a friend of blaggs to spy upon him and ascertain his whereabouts on the night of the fire when simpleminded people employ amateur detectives the result is all but inevitable hillier the detective draws large sums of money from his employer and produces no evidence until at last mrs tremayne has her eyes opened and angrily dismisses him one part of the problem is solved by the opportune death of blagg of a paralytic stroke the other by the return of mrs tremaynes old lover john dethick quite a readable book and the writing above the average  the sword by c a benton is evidently a first novel but it shows considerable promise the female characters are ably drawn but that of the hero is not very well realised desiree st just young vivacious and handsome under the shadow of a husband serving a term of penal servitude for fraud is a pathetic figure and her renunciation of the man she loves at the last moment touches a poignant note miss benton must use her adverbs more sparingly in dialogue the reader should be allowed to infer the meaning of such expressions as  whimsically and  quizzically etc if they have any meaning from the context mr bernard capes has the art rare amongst english writers no doubt through lack of encouragement of telling a short story as it ought to be told in  bag and baggage 6 he does this often enough to justify the reproduction of these stories which have for the most part appeared originally in magazines but he does not always  beneath dark wings began excellently well and if it had been half the length it would have been an effective piece of work but the introduction of the dissertation on the spectrum analysis marred the effect by reducing to scientific terms the elements of mystery the best of a good lot is undoubtedly  the soft seraphic screen a very terrible story but told with consummate skill of the inherited taint of alcoholism which ends inevitably in a final catastrophe the stories in lighter vein are good but none so good as this it is a tribute to mr desmond cokes skill that although none of his characters are likable and win our sympathy  helena bretts career  holds ones interest hubert brett a fourthrate novelist of proportionate vanity was in his bachelor days  gey ill to live with as his sister found to her cost when he married helena hallam he meant her to be a great mans plaything in his leisure moments helena soon found that she had a formidable rival in her husbands work and being left much to herself she sought other diversions and as the family pot was with difficulty coaxed to boil helena blossomed out into the anonymous author of a work entitled  confessions of an authors wife if the secret had been kept all might have been well but it wasnt for the publisher was a bad man and could not resist the temptation to make more money by breaking the contract of inviolable secrecy and the fat was then in the fire helena apologises to her husband for having written such a bad novel that it had an instant success but he remembering his own dwindling circulation is not to be appeased but a deus ex machind arrives to solve the difficulty and with what success we must leave mr cokes readers to judge for themselves  the ways of eve by roy mleldrum7 is a bright and pleasant story written round the claim to an estate and the temporary impoverishment of the person in possession there are however no grim tragedies and only enough trouble to remind one that the world albeit a pleasant place enough is not yet quite a garden of eden the book ends with a wedding breakfast and the felicitous compliments generally associated with such an event and what more can one desire  h a h  manu inventions by rudyard kipling macmillans at last the short story has taken firm root in english soil though in france many a master of fiction has fashioned his most lasting creations in this form but of late certain english newspapers have caused a demand for such work and mr kipling has been more than any one else its pioneer as yet however too many of the tales put before us are only boileddown novels few of our authors have acquired as have their french contemporaries notably barbey daurevilly the trick of choosing such subjects as ought not to be treated in any other manner the doings of their personages for instance are not always immediately intelligible yet if a short story is to be effective the characters must be so introduced as to make the reader feel at once that ho knows them personally for in work of this class the rapid and sure delineation of character is of even more importance than the plot mr kiplings best stories contain the right qualities in a very marked degree and these same qualities are mainly responsible for his failure as a novelist it is a matter for rejoicing then that he lias stayed his hand from though writing of novels and given us a book after the style of his earlier better work yet it is not an easy book to review for it ia perversely unequal between its covers lie several historiettos i know of no more objectionable and appropriate wordwhich lesser men thau mr kipling might well have hesitated to sign he even sins at times by being dull and when the laugh is bid for the reader can only respond by a yawn it were of course useless to expect that any writer however capable should always be at his best moreover a uniform excellence too often means mediocrity still it is amazing to find in this volume such stuff as  brugglesmith  judson and the empire and  the children of the zodiac it were perhaps unfair to condemn mr kipling for having included them but it is impossible not to wonder at their presence for the rest of these stories we have only hearty praise in  the disturber of traffic mr kipling gives us one of those inimitable sketches of blended farce and pathos that he alone seems able to contrive the lost legion  is a splendid ghost story telling how an afghan robber was surprised and captured by english officers and their men through  though aid of a regiment whose name did not appear in the brigade orders how it aided lieutenant halley and the major in their manoeuvres and why those gentlemen lost their tempers it would be unfair to reveal several stories are devoted to the already famous soldiers three stories no less good than those that first gained for them immortal fame the psychological skill of  the finest story in the world is of course remarkable but the two most successful and certainly the boldest stories in the collection are  in the rukh and  a matter of fact it required a very sure touch an absolute mastery of words and form to overcome the difficulties that here threatened and would certainly have overwhelmed any but a really capable writer there was every chance of complete failure and yet they are perfectly successful and convincing in the rukh is an account of a wild native bred up in the jungle among  his brothers the wolves and mr kipling thus describes him  a man was walking down the dried bed of the stream naked except for the loincloth but crowned with a wreath of the tasseiled blossoms of the white convolvulus creeper so noiselessly did he move over the little pebbles that even gisborne used to the softfootedne88 of trackers started his voice was clear and belllike utterly different from the usual whine of the native and his face as he lifted it in the sunshine might have been that of an angel strayed among the woods he has not ceased to be human because he has power over all the beasts of the jungle dwells among them and moves about attended by his wolves calling them back and forth as a king calls his armies he gives repeated evidence of his power to the great contentment of gisborne sahib of the woods and forests and to the great confusion of the mahommedan butler whose daughter ho loves the whole study is ono of great subtilty and marked by a powerful restraint not usual in mr kiplings work it closes with a love idyll of exquisite beauty  a matter of fact narrates how throe journalists the author himself a yankee and a dutchman the only passengers on a  little tramp steamer see the seaserpent and its mate some six or seven feet above the port bulwarks framed in fog and as utterly unsupported as a full moon hung a face the mouth was op n revealing a ridiculously tiny tonguo as absurd as the tongue of an elephant there were tense wrinkles of white skin at the angles of the drawn lips while feelers like those of a barbel sprung from the lower jaw and there was no sign of teeth within the mouth but the horror of the face lay in the eyes for those were sightlesswhite in sockets as white as scraped bone and blind yet for all this the face wrinkled as the mask of a lion is drawn in assyrian sculpture was alive with rage and terror from this point the tragedy moves on relentlessly to its end the terrific deathstruggle of the monster the savage hopeless grief of the female the chill horror of the fog and the noisome masses of cold protoplasm on the waves are so vividly described that one shudders involuntarily as one reads the difficulty of the three enterprising  newspaper men  as to what they shall do with their magnificent but incredible and useless  scoop makes an amusing and welcome finish to an astonishing story these are not the only stories i should have liked to quote from one scene in  love o woman and some brilliant passages in  my lord the elephant and his private honour ought not to be ignored in the other side of the question  mr kipling has marked for us one more type among the peoples of that vast eastern empire of ours of which we are at once so proud and so ignorant a capital poem ushers in this remarkable volume for remarkable it is because though it con lins quite the worst things mr kipling ever wroteand they are very badit gives us more than two hundred pages of by far the best work he has yet published it is but fair to close with the last verse of the noble and characteristic envoy earnest let us hope of a book of sea ballads such as no other living englishman is so able to indite 44 wheel full and by but shell smell her road alone to night sick ene is and harbour eick ob sick to clear the land boll down to breast with the old bed ensign over us carry on and thrash her out with

to mother carey wulk her down to mot ber carey ob were bound for mother carey where she feeds her chicks at sea percy addlesfjaw  new books many inventions mr kipling alters scarcely at all when he does it is partly his own fault this volume seems and probably is inferior to  lifes handicap it contains no single work equal to his earlier masterpiecesnothing which one can pronounce quite perfect the reason is obvious he takes less pains i do not mean less time or trouble for likely enough he finds selfrepetition harder work than selfexpression but he no longer so entirely absorbs himself in the story growing up in his brain no longer lives temporarily in it and for it so completely as to grasp it as a whole as a living organism with definite proportions and nicely adjusted parts and thus to present instinctively all its vital elements marvellously ordered and balanced in a work of perfect art it could not well be otherwise in those early pages we trace the young struggling author cheered no doubt by visions of future fame and fortune but forgetting those visions in the intensity of production whose vivid creations become for the moment no longer a means to an end but the end itself the only reality the only interest and delight of life at such times as one of like experience has told me the story grows up and shapes itself of its own accord clamouring to be set down in writing till it is written the actual life and surroundings of the author fade and dwindle into faraway sordid unrealities and the dream alone is tangible fact so strong is the spell that we seem to but slumber to our external life and awake to the sharpcut vibrant reality of the world of imagination and this highly developed form of selfhypnotism is what men call inspiration it never lasts long aged seers may be experienced and impressive but the genuine prophets are the young ones mr kipling like the rest of us will never sleep or dream as soundly as of old a wider horizon new interests the varied business of life the demands of fame and of societyall must inevitably tend to disenchant the imperative vision once eagerly pursued and scrupulously recorded becomes less and less real more and more mechanical storytelling we find is not the sole but only a subordinate object of lifewe no longer live to write but write to live to amuse ourselves keep up our reputations or just from mere habit mr kipling has his own sphere and in that he is never likely to excel himself he has done enough when he is gone and things have settled down about a dozen of his short pieces will be selected and that little book will stand as a masterpiece probably never to be rivalled but that is no reason why he should now leave off he need not write for fame or to show us what he can do but to amuse and instruct and stimulate usin short because we all want him to go on and to go on in his own proper walk these new inventions may be more or less inferior variations on his old themes but they are variations not imitations and we much prefer to have them from the hand of the master himself rather than from those of his numerous disciples for that hand has by no means lost its cunning it is as supple as quick as strong as tender as brutal as before though not so instinctive and masterful no he alters very little his topics are the same his way of looking at them is unchanged his method of presentation never varies not one of his faults has he even attempted to correct so he still remains individual and beyond rules if his work is less superlative as a whole that is due to the inevitable cause that i have indicated yet not wholly it is partly his own fault there is not only a certain air of effort and weariness in some of these  new inventions but at times positive carelessness i find not a few passages where though instinct failed experience might surely have suggested improvement hardly one of the stories but would bear recasting abridgment or alteration they have not been so carefully or at least so earnestly thought out and reduced to shape the best test is perhaps the conclusions one is seldom able to end with a note of admiration but with a feeling of unsatisfaction or even of disillusion and  many inventions by r kipling macmillan further what at first were startling innoati fantastic vagaries and daring licenses become on frequent repetition too much like mannerisms one i will mention because its effects are really serious it is the trick of intentional obscurity we are told minutely what people do and what they sayand to make thing worse they talk in oraclesbut we are not told what they mean till the next page meanwhile we are supposed to be enjoying the mystification and so we did two years ago but now it only fatigues nay worse exasperates when as at pages 3 19 and 320 we try in vain to follow the action and then when the key is given turn back to find that the action was clumsily and obscurely narrated in this case the boat must somehow have turned round similarly the story is often eked out and the mystery kept up by making the characters speak in oracular evasive or ambiguous terms or else persist in holding their tongues in a most unnatural and annoying way another trick is his constant allusion to oaths and bad language and the euphemistic paraphrases he uses for them we know that soldiers expletives are not pretty but then they are mere expletives without definite meaning to our ears such words do suggest a meaning which disgusts and horrifies if then the ipsissima zerba will not bear quotation why hint at them at all  further the settings to the tales which were usually so appropriate a frame are getting a little mechanical while sometimes as in  love o women they overshadow the main story in one piece  in the rukh mr kipling reaches his highest standard his natives were always more picturesque than his europeans it is a most impressive study of the indian forest and contains many splendid descriptionsone line is superb  and the forest was waking to the hushed ravenous life of the night yet even here though there is a laudable absence of the supernatural we sup full of improbabilities the marvellous forestman has been suckled by a wolf and is attended and served through life by his four grisly fosterbrothers these wolves then rmust have remained young and agile to the age of twenty or thirty besides the fraternal tie does not last between wolves much less their human fosterbrothers after each has gone out into the world on his own account the orpheus scene is moreover a most illjudged and incongruous embellishment still all this does not destroy the singular charm of the story  the disturber of traffic is an amusing little nautical yarn very much spun out it contains an interesting study of mania and a curious malay of whom we would gladly hear more my lord the elephant is a variation of  motiguj but not nearly so good and much too long the description of the elephants in the setting is very fine but mulvaneys story is a palpable lie and to tell the truth we have had almost enough of the clever talk of the soldiers three perhaps the letrs persaxes have had their day but there was room for the clever little imitation called  one view of the question mr kipling is not only shrewd he is wise and in the letter from shafiz ullah he tells us some nasty home truths among them the hopelessness of an india governed by an england governed by newspaper writers and readers to this theme he returns in  judson and the empire which opens with some very painful and highly improper remarks on the sacred theme of democracy the story is amusing and developes into downright burlesque but though confessedly a mere foreign office skit it does exemplify most vividly such history as is manufactured in faroff africa and probably reveals the true bearings of the angloportuguese squabble and through it all staggers and wobbles most pitiably that biggest and emptiest of bubbles that ever man blew and likened to the great globe itselfthe poor soapbom windbag of nineteenthcentury republicanism in his private honour we have ortheris again who has been struck on parade by a young officer the story is too long and somewhat obscure this affair is arranged by private fisticuffs in the jungle for a civilian to hint an opinion is perhaps touching or at least talking about the ark but i do think it is too bad of the author to bolster up this stupid wickedness and hint at murder and mutiny british soldiers are neither hyenas not french assassinsnordinary to a popular journal this excellent young officer surely bad tact enough to say in private a few simple hearty and flattering words of explanation and regret which would have been accepted nay treasured by this excellent soldier and afterwards to allow it to be inferred that such words had been spoken that such would have been the natural the sensible the english the only course i am prepared to maintain in the face of the guns and mr kipling a very original munchausen tale of the death of the seaserpent in a submarine volcanic eruption is introduced as a matter of fact the idea is most original and picturesque but more might have been made of it and here again we are teased by the old trick of deferring the key to minutely recorded action otherwise the marvels are picturesque enough and the epilogue is an original and subtle idea though very coarsely and obscurely worked out  the lost legion an account of a night attack contains some masterly descriptions and much instruction on border warfare but is hardly improved by the supernatural element love o women opens with a fine episode of a murder and trial which introduce a long don juan story by mulvaney which so far as i can grapple with its obscurity seems to come under the head of the blasphemously goody yet mulvaney is always the irish gentleman and a king of men we hardly dare criticise him his glowing picture pp 270272 of the return of the troops warms the heart like one of marryats honest pages hitherto we have been dealing with mr kipling on his proper ground when he strays into english scenes the indefinable taint of journalism spoils everything of this we have here a few examples  brugglesmith  is a farcical adventure with a drunken man incredible and artificialin fact mere theodore hook without the rollicking fun how differently mr stevenson would have treated the episode with his art of embellishing trifles the novelist in a conference of the powers  is a journalistic caricature the boyishness of the young officers much exaggerated the conversation highly mechanical and the constant interpretation of indian terms very tiresome  the finest story in the world is a dead failure stories about metempsychosis are utterly unjustifiable save as jeux desprit and this one alas  is tedious circumstantial and longwinded the author has however more or less broken new ground in two directions one is an allegorical tale highly original and in parts very striking but it is rather obscure and the machinery novel and confusing six signs and these not all beneficent ones are called the  children of the zodiac and are to be murdered by the other six not all malignant which are called  houses leo the hero appears as a man plays the part of orpheus and marries virgo but there is nothing vague about  the record of badalia herodsfoot here mr kipling is in whitechapel and at once makes himself at home where the prim inmates of toynbee hall if they hold the fort till the crack of doom will be but strangers in the land i do not pretend to admire the manncr it is zolaism but the best piece of zolaism which any englishman has yet done nay it is in one way an improvement upon the master because it is terser and more concentrated many a point we might trace to its sourcethe curate brother victor the terrible epilogue and the victim screening the murderer which is plainly suggested by a similar scene in la terre but the picture is none the less original certainly none the less truthful its grim humour is terrible mr kipling sees and i only hope will make others see how hideous is the hell in which pullulate the nisbegotten untrained vicious children whom we call men and women of the unemployed and criminal classes how noble and how beautiful are the varied efforts of all the churches and sects and philanthropies and humanities to palliate its horrorsand alas how tentative how ignorant how blind to facts and first principles how illjudged how ineffectual he hints he almost dares to say boldly that these fellow citizens of ours many of them voters and so lawmakers and your masters and minewhy blink the truth are practically a race apart in spite of much teaching and preaching they only fool us into thinking they accept our civilisation they have their own rude philosophy their own superstitions and fetish worship their own marriage customs their own ethics their own conceptions of law and justice their own language in all these we have no part unless we sink to their level in fact they are in the savage state aboriginal or relapsed and one might venture to suggest that an apprenticeship in the african or pacific mission field would be no bad preparation for the london social reformer but when we once face the facts they are not all repulsive this badaliato my mind the most precious of all mr kiplings creationsthis impudent practical rowdy befringed costerwench is the missionwoman of the future whatever is done for the people must be done through the peoplethe rest will be done by the people themselves one follows badalia in her good works with intense interest and by her tragic fate we lose a new friend she is a grand creation and might fitly stalk through three volumes though we have only known the saucy warmhearted vain faithful womanly woman for a few pages we are the better for it yy  literature many inventions by rudyard kipling macmillan  co mb kipling has gone back in the volume before us to his first lovethe short story  the light that failed if it was not altogether a masterpiece of construction possessed much solid excellence and  the naulahka so far as mr kipling was concerned with its making was full of picturesqueness and vitality but for all that neither of these more ambitious efforts was the great novel which the writers admirers were perhaps unreasonably expecting from him it is we think becoming clear that whether we take him as poet or as prose stylist mr kiplings best work is done within the narrower limits of the ballad and the conte his effects are gained by just the qualities which such forms of art require swift intuition and stern repression  and in his longer tales he has given as yet no suggestion of that power of patiently accumulating details upon a large and complex designthat epic faculty to put it briefly which is the attribute of the supreme masters of fiction this is of course not to deny that in the sphere he has made his own mr kipling is an admirable writer whether of prose or verse that he is so it would be absurd to dispute it simply means that we have now to reconsider our original guarded estimate of mr kiplings gifts and potentialities and to admit that he is something not less than but different from what we were at one time inclined to believe him in many inventions mr kipling has thrown together various specimens of the work which has appeared from his pen in several quarters during the last few years with one or two stories that we do not remember having seen before the best of them all to our mind is  love o women which is indeed one of the most masterly things its author has yet done and is fit to rank beside the six great successes of his  lifes handicap as a study of inexorable retribution and unspeakable remorse it is worth a hundred addresses on social purity platforms  and yet it is written with an artistic reticence which is beyond all praise mulvaney tells the story as only mulvaney can and the following fragment will suffice to show that what we have said above is no extravagant eulogy  ye can ondersthand that afther that night we came to talkin a dale together an bit by bit ut came out fwhat i d suspicioned the whole av his carrins on an divilmenta had come back on him hard as liquor comes back whin you ve been

cud ha been happy anyway 4 his private honour introduces us once more to that quintessence of cockneyism the incomparable ortheris and a brisker tale was never penned how young ouless who 44had a skin or two to slough and hadnt the sense to be aware of it as the major said lost his head and struck ortheris before the whole company at drill and how the insult was wiped out by a genuine bout of fisticuffs between officer and private which in the most natural way restored the latters good opinion of himself and made a man of the former is inimitably described it reveals once more if the revelation were necessary how close and intimate is the knowledge that mr kipling enjoys of the recesses of the soldiers heart and how sympathetically he can turn that knowledge to account if 4love o women be tragedy and 4 his private honour comedy there is no doubt that 4 my lord the elephant is pure unadulterated farce in this most flamboyant most coruscating of yarns mulvaney comes near to beating and it is much to say the record of his famous 4 incarnation his ride on though infuriated tusker is as fine as that of tam o shanter himself and the sequel to it in which ortheris 44 takes up the wondrous tale is as funny as anything we have ever read the elephant it should be premised has 44 shtuck at the head of the tan gi pass like a cork in a bottle and refuses to budge an inch 41 eard

B630	"['4618505', '4991985', '4337431']"	  ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchen make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word  you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us  im not going to said 1 somewhat testily  the tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor

B2742	['9425969']	  constance slierwood ail autobiography of th  sixteentli century new novels i by lady georgiana fut  lerton 3 vols bentley tales of religious persecution are always heroic the story of sufferings born for the sake of a creed which the sufferers believe to be the one supreme form of religious truth through which alone their prayers to the god and father of all can be offered have the power to make the heart of every generous reader burn within him for they appeal to the deepest instincts and highest sympathies of our human nature this sympathyis quite irrespective ofthe creed of the sufferers in stories all the political elements which gave rise to the strife are kept out of sight and we are shown only the innocent victims to the stern laws of the dominant party in troublous times so whether they be tales of the early christians persecuted under the roman emperors tales of christiana persecuted by other christians for points of inaccuracy in their formulas persecutions of the albigenses persecutions of the huguenot persecutions of the early reformation by the church regnant or persecutions of the roman catholics when the reformed church became dominant in england or the cruelties against the covenanters in scotland the reader can feel only sympathy with the victims martyrs give the supreme testimony to the faith for which they suffer and every feuowreatiur who reads their story feels proud of theil courage and constancy but that is because the political passions the fear and the deadly strife of tongues have all passed away and left un capable of discerning the still sad music of humanity which was ever going on in the midst of the confused noise and the garments rolled in blood we recognise in the sufferers men and brethren now that they can no more offend us by their diversities of opinion it is only on the surface of the ocean that the waters rage and swell a very little way below the surface is perfect calm lady georgiana fullerton has chosen for her theme the sufferings that religious catholics had to incur in the early days of the reformation when spanish armadas papist conspiracies and a roman catholic retender to the throne gave rise to penal aws against the roman catholics as severe and stringent as the fears of the dominant party could devise or their power enforce swarms of contemptible informers and  base betrayers of their brothers blood aroseas they have done in all times of persecution as they will ever do in her story lady georgiana introduces the record of most of the roman catholic sufferers whose names are many of them little known to the protestant general reader but which  are carefully enshrined in the memory of their  own church she also speaks of other men as  saints and martyrs who were deeply involved io the intricate politics and conspiracies of the period and who suffered for them quite as much as for their religion she paints from the roman catholic point of view and keeps entirely to the religious aspect of the struggle in her pages the catholics are oppressed men only desirous of worshipping with freedom in their own mannerwhich the laws then existing forbade under pain of death and confiscation lady georgiana fullerton always writes with grace and refinement she does not give highlywrought scenes of horror  on the contrary she is studiously selfrestrained and moderate the heroine is a fictitious personage a certain mistress constance sherwood a gentlewoman in the reign of queen elizabeth much attached to the ancient faith and connected either by consanguinity or friendship with many notable persons who suffered for their adherence to their religion most of the secondary personages are real people and the incidents narrated are for the most part quite true the references are given at the end of the third volume the story of constance sherwood is a touching picture of life under a reign of terror and penal laws there is no plot it is merely the record of the lisa of constance sherwood from year to yearof the fears temptations and difficulties under which she and her friends held fast their faith and of the testimony which many amongst them sealed with their blood the passages in the life of the countess of arundel and surrey are taken from the history of that noble house of course everything that could jar upon the readers sympathy is kept out of sight and all the catholics in the book are the most excellent of the earth the incidents of heroic generosity and selfsacrifice are told with a chastened enthusiasm which increases the readers admiration the sentiments which all the catholics express are of the purest and noblest religious virtuesuch as all christian men and women ought to feel lady georgiana fullerton has written a book  which no one can read without deep interest i g and she has written it in an admirable spirit s substituting the reformed religion for the s roman catholic it is just such a work

truthfully yet spiritedly drawn the events recorded are supposed to have transpired some century or so ago in the days of powder and swords and the plot is simple and may be conveyed in a few words sir thomas warren a man of pleasure and a courtier having been employed for ten years in a diplomatic capacity abroad returns unexpectedly to england and finding himself from a variety of causes incapable of pursuing the course of life in which he has been hitherto indulging determines to occupy himself in the education of his son whom he has hitherto sadly neglected now his son jack has been residing from his infancy in thc remote corner of a midland county with his uncle squire warren a fine specimen of thc foxhunter of that period in character habits and conversation he reminds us forcibly of old sir roger de coverley aud consequently presents a striking contrast to his foppish and effeminate brother living under bis roof partaking in all his amusements and pursuits jack had become the precise counterpart of his worthy relative at thc epoch when he is introduced to us he is  rising nineteen over six feet in height hale hearty and robust a keen sportsman shy and ungainly in his manners generous and warmhearted but somewhat inclined to obstinacy and in intellect not over bright at the time when his father arrives with the intention of carrying him off to london to educate him  wiore suorum jack finds himself most unpleasantly circumstanced in consequence of an attachment bc had long since formed with the fair daughter of thc vicar lydia freeman a young belle whose bright eyes have inflamed the hearts of more than one admirer fearing an angry refusal in case he should seek his fathers consent to their union he determines to brusque matters and accordingly first obtains the young ladys consent aud then informs his parent to his astonishment sir thomas offers no opposition to the match provided thc weddingday is postponed for a couple of years as he fully anticipates that long ere then an introduction to london life with all its concomitants will have eradicated this  boyish fancy poor jack arrives in london and finds himself suddenly immersed in gaieties for which he has no taste dissipations that he abhors compelled as he is at the same time to forego all his wonted pursuits and to submit to the severest discipline while he is forced te acquire accomplishments that only render him still more awkward in his demeanour and more ludicrous in his appearance sir thomas having resolved that jack should marry a lady of fortune takes much pains to effect his introduction to an eligible individual of that denomination this excites the jealousy of a host of rivals for though jack remains undeviatingly true to his  little lydia he is compelled by bis unreasonable father to make some show of  attention  to the captivating widow fairfax now it so happens that one colonel pcnruddock has already determined to win and wear her like many others of her sex under similar circumstances out of caprice the lady pretends to admire jack greatly though she has secretly predetermined to give her hand to the colonel they meet at an evening party  tins insult colonel penruddocks malignant glance was on him hatred contempt and jealousy gleamed in his eye that very morning mistress fairfax had carelessly saidon pur pose of coursethat she never beheld so fine a man as mr warrenthat be possessed so artless yet so fascinating a mode of paying his addresses she was sure no heart could resist him then she leaned her cheek on her hand looked absent sighed and allowed the colonel to address her twice before she appeared to know that he had done so at all the colonel threw himself into one of his most violent tornadoes and rushed out of the house the widow tapped ber chin approvingly with her fan surveyed her charming face in thc glass laughed hummed an opera tune and went to the auction tiie colonel had not condescended so much as to bow to her on the evening in question when he saw jack proceeding towards her the muscles of his thin face worked nervously he placed himself in the way and as jack approached leaned his hand on though back of a chair and advanced his right foot directly in jacks path jack hurrying  to qct it over perceived not the guardsmans movement isle drew near the colonel contracting every muscle held bis foot firmly planted jack tripped the colonel smiled a ghastly smile had jack been lighter or more active he would have tripped and recovered himself but the poor fellow was neither he tripped stumbled ran two or three paces forward and fell prostrate at the widows feet good manners were totally forgotten and a titter which grew to a laugh salutedjacks misfortune sir thomas swore and fumed jack arose anger and indignation chased shyness and mauvaue honte from his soul everything around bim seemed to whirl and totter he heard the laughter he felt the insult ke strode up to colonel penruddock like a young hercules and in a loud clear voice he shouted  was that on purpose or by accident  on purpose replied the colonel bowing and then drawing himself up to his utmost height  then take that 1 roared jack and doubling his fist he drew it back to his shoulder then straitening bis arm with the iron strength of a gladiator he struck the colonel on though face with the whole might of his thick muscular arm the colonel reeled and fell crushing a chair in his tall au the mun present rushed towards him the laughter was hushed penruddock arose with an oat the blood streaming from his face several ladies fell into  hysteric affections  and faintings but the gentlemen being all occupied round jack and the colonel they soon recovered their senses sir thomas drew his son away from penruddock anger and disgust stamped upon his features this unpleasant incident of course gives rise to a duel which is so admirably described that we cannot refrain from quoting it the duel there had been a slight fall of snow during the night which only partially covered the ground though shrill thin voice of thc sweep and though rolling of a few heavy dust carts were the predominating sounds the air was damp and penetrating the atmosphere murky and dull and beginning to bo charged with the smoke of early fires though shops were unopenedfew passengers abroadhere and there a workman proceeding to his work pipe iu mouth its very cold said lord langley as they walked quickly to the back of montagu house  i wonder if the colonels on the ground  i seo him drawing near said jack  theres the captaiu with him aud another fellowthe surgeon i take it lord langley forced a smile and saidto make our party equal to theirs i begged our family surgeon to be on the ground and there he is  thankee it was very thoughtful of you my love to my father and 1 hope hell accept thc watch i brought from the country in remembrance of mc hang it i forgot his messagehones youll come home to breakfast with us if i come off all right  i shall bc delighted preliminaries were soon settled and though combatants stripping off coat waistcoat and stock crossed their welltempered glittering taper swords  what a lino young fellow your friend i my lord whispered lord langleys surgeon to him  i never saw a liner man dead or alive pity if he falls lord langley sighed and looked sorrowfully at poor jack the regimental surgeon who attended the colonel was equally struck with him egad sir what a grenadier hed make he said to captain richmond  i should ask nothing better than to command a battalion of the same sort was the reply jack and the colonel began their duel under very different feelings jack was determined not to hurt the colonel but merely to parry his thrusts he had no ill will towards him and no feeling for duels the colonel on the other hand felt that he was opposed to a rival and a man who had insulted him and put bim in a ridiculous position beneath the very eyes of his mistress his soul was bitter with hatred und revenge and he swore that cither jack or himself must die that day after a short  bout seeing jacks play he dropped the point of his sword and cried with flashing eyes and angry voice  i will not be treated like a child sir fight fairly and attack me as well as defend yourself jack obeyed and presently his bright sword entered penruddocks right breast fortunately for him the point slipped along one of the ribs instead of penetrating between them and anon though fight was renewed the swords wound about each other like lightningthc clear light clashing peculiar to the small sword only to be rightly explained by the word ucliquetis was the only sound heard jack received a wound in the thick of the arm but acquitted himself very well never lost bis coolness or temper aud gave the colonel a great deal to do still the swords clashed and glittered seconds and surgeons breathless with interest knew not on which of the combatants to pronounce at last penruddock with the expression of a demon parried one of jacks thrustsadvancedlungedthe guard of his sharp sword struck his adversarys nbs in a line with his breast the reddened blade coming out beneath the left arm pic thank the gods muttered the colonel as he drew out his sword and lord langley captain richmond and both surgeons rushed towards poor jack  i dont think its much he said putting his hand to his side  is the colonel satisfied lord langley put his arm around him jacks face grew pale his knees gave way beneath bis weight und bc sank to the earth supporting himself on his hands the surgeons tore away bis shirt the sooner to arrive at his wound they saw at once the course the sword had taken and shook their heads at lord langley  youd better not move him or disturb him my lordit will soon be over whispered the regimental surgeon lord langley kneeling down supported his dying friend and took his hand in bis poor jack feebly pressed it and witi an effort said  will you break it to my uncle and lyddie  god bless you  i will on my honour replied lord langley his eyes filled with tears there was solemn silencea silence that could be felt the surgeons knelt on each side of jack thc colonel and his friend were gone the denouement of this touching history we leave our readers to peruse from the book itself and as we cannot improve upon our authors eloquent language we subjoin the important moral he is desirous of inculcating the moral fathers before you put your sons in any particular path in life study if you can their various dispositions characters talents and capabilities how often do we see men in the army or navy who had they been allowed to follow their true bent would have made excellent churchmen or lawyers and who on their fathers death quit the profession of arms for more genial pursuits again how often do we see a languishing nonchalant clergyman without feeling for his calling perishing with ennui who would have been a distinguished soldier but for the paternal will which said  that boy must go into the church then again we behold a barrister detesting penandink and close hot courts and law study and practicea being whose aspirations and talents all pointed to the sea but his fathers taste pointed to an intellectual profession and the boy without the least love of study or much aptitude for it is dragooned bon gri mal gre to the bar you will see such an one during his vacation living in salt wateryachting steaming rowing voyaging in merchantmen and returning to bis gown and wig with a weary heart 1 do not mean that because a boy has read  robaer crusoe  as young gentlemen are wont to pronounce the name that his enthusiasm is to be gratified by being sent in quest of shipwreck and  man friday any more than that he should be allowed to be a highwayman a character for which some boys have a great penchant because his enthusiasm has been awakened by the life of robin hood or dick turpin but it is a cruel sight to see a mans life passing by in though daily avocations of a profession for which lie bas no feelingperhaps a positive dislikeand to which a fathers will condemned him even before he could walk or talki young gentlemens caprices should not bo studied but their characters and aptitudes are worthy of some little consideration we know not whether this is mr gwynnes first essay at authorship if however such it be we congratulate the reading public upon thc pleasure they may reasonably anticipate from the future productions of his graceful pen and lively fancy he displays not only a cultivated but an observant minda keen appreciation of humour and his descriptive powers are fully upon a par with those of any living writer we hope that the momentous lesson he seeks to impress upon the generation of  fathers  will not have been preached in vain and the volume before us will indeed be a valuable one if it prove the means of averting from a single youth the sad doom of being forced to embrace a profession opposed to all his tastes habits and inclinations  the school for fathers an old englisjt story our library table by t gwynnemr gwynne gives us another taleand not the worst which has been toldin disparagement of town as opposed to country a fine untutored hearty boy with a herculean frame and a hearty appetite was brought up by an old english gentleman his uncle to think that life contains duties no graver and pleasures no sweeter than those belonging to a pinka pair of buckskinsa southerly wind and a cloudy skya jolly dinner when the chase was overand a rosebud looking over the parsons gate in the shape of the parsons pretty daughter when jack grew to mans estate he was claimed by bis fathera precious type of the  father upon town of old comedya being all patches and pouncet box and redheeled shoes who cherished his hands in a muff and his shapely legs in curiously clocked hose sipped scandal over his chocolate held every fine woman to be the lawful prize of every macaronis vanity and considered all homely tastes sincere affections and generous sentiments as so much obsolete nonsense unbecoming a complete gentleman such a father though easily conjured up by any one decently read in congreve and the spectator we nevertheless apprehend had never a real existence as type of a class  seized on by this demon of gentility and false breeding poor jack was compelled up to london in spite of himself  and there handed over to a dancing master a fencing master a french master a tailor who made torturing coats a wigraaker who crowned the youthful and truthful english head with the falsehood of a periwig he waa desired to begin the sport of ladykillingto distinguish himself as a man of gallantry if by honest lovemaking well antlgoodif by its reverse none the worse the wicked and perverting father too made no secret of his wickedness threw no cloak over evil calling it good but openly professed worldliness as his creed and fashion as his idol and laughed complacently at his belief in his divinity jack obeyedstout in those exaggerated notions of filial submission by which the sons of england are invited to obey no matter what provided the church register and the old family bible invest it with paternal authority to this oledience the countrybred youth fell a martyrbeing shot in a duelthere is force in many of the scenes of this sad but factitious story and mr gwynne is well acquainted with the catchwords and costume of his period but the tale is not agreeable to us simply for the reason above hintedbecause it is untrue as untrue as the son of the soil who figured in the comedies of reynolds and okeeffe and colman producing from beneath his scarlet waistcoat manly sentiments and antipathies to everything french the like of which never grew in any real shire or hundred of england our objection to all classnovels is not lessened by the fact of the classes being laputan or brobdignagianor in short utterly and perversely

late years been much explored and many tales have been translated into english the field is however still ample to afford an abundant harvest even were riot the prolific pens of living authors still adding to the pile the northern nations have poured forth their stores and the whole italian novelists have been resorted to in order to furnish food for the unsatiated appetite for works of fiction which prevails in this country ir soane i who is pretty conversant with german literature has confined himself to tales in that language and if he has not selected the best that exist for this is a point on which persons may disagree he has certainly given us such as deserved to be introduced into this country and these he has translated with much spirit in a brief advertisement the translator says when he commenced this work it was with the intention of carrying it on through many volumes and thus to have presented a complete circle of german romance but circuimstances have occurred to interrupt this project perhaps the stagnation that prevails in the book trade may have bpen the cause mr soane also notices another circumnstance and observes that a work of thig nature allows no compromise with english tastes and feelings but demands that the several tales should be selected with reference to their popularity among germans such n apology is scarcey necessary to a people that have feasted for weeks on doctor faustus and supped nightly for mionths on the sublime horrors of jder ifrieschutz the remark of the translator is however a true one the tales in these volumes are five in nuinber the first the patricians from the gerinan of c f van der velde occupies the wyhole of the first volume while the second is devoted to the master llea of c t a hoffman the third volume contains the blind passenger by f laun the adventurers by a oehlenschliiger and the mantle by b naubert these tales which present all the varieties of tihe grave and the humorous are enriched with three clever etchings by george cruilkshank the first tale the patricians relates to the feuds that prevailed ill the sixteenth century between the nobles and the citizens we shall not enter at any

character mr barrie evidently with some compunction suffers the sentimental genius to dree his weird the fatal gift of pens and ink and the escape from farm drudgery are the worst misfortunes for poor tommy tommy should have enlisted physical courage any amount of presence of mind in an emergency thorough identification of himself with his part and enough imagination to know  what is going on at the other side of the hill would have been no mean qualifications for a soldier but he falls in with a slovenly silenus who earns his ale and occasional cakes by writing fluent commonplace for the publishers of serial romance for the rabble such a tutor puts tommy on a course of investigation only too congenial to him and the success of his first and famous work on woman completes his ruin he gets into a certain society in which his uncanny knowledge is attributed to his having 44 loved and lost and the tragedy of two lives is the result a feeling of disappointment which most readers will probably share is no doubt in a way tribute to the vividness of the authors portraiture but the lack of constructive power that does much to mar mr barries claim to be regarded as a novelist and not merely a clever sketcher of simple types of character is apparent in his handling of his hero once in thrums again tommy is no longer harmless though the steps of his wrongdoing show the struggles of his better nature more than once he is tempted to confide to grizel his true self but he did not know what it was in fact with all his precocity tommy never grew up and thus like many another cheerful egotist became the curse of those who loved him best there are as was to be expected inequalities of treatment in the minor personages lady pippin worth is not convincing vulgar as may oe the world of

barries sequel to sentimental tommy cassells 6s without wishing that tommy had never lived to be a man he should have been a boy for ever that however is a vain wish for mr barrie has allowed tommy to grow up and we must take him as we find him in sketching tommys career as a man of genius mr barrie has penned a satire upon the artistic temperament he does not spare tommy and lays bare with a ruthless hand the secret springs which prompt all the actions of this spoiled child of fortune in a concluding chapter mr barrie makes selections from the imaginary obituary notices which appeared in the papers at the death of mr t sandys it is a touch of a master hand and a cutting satire upon the worlds estimate of a mans character and ideals from the day tommy sets foot in london in search of work as the amanuensis of  colossal  pymn the writer of cheap popular serial fiction to the moment when he hangs throttled on the spikes of the park railings of lord rintouls estate he is incurably sentimental he clothes every act with a gauzy mist of sentiment he is tyrannised over by his sentimental impulses whose promptings he is powerless to resist his actions are performed not because he believes them good or bad but because of what he thinks other people will say of them he is always playing a part and always conscious that he is playing it he can make believe at times so superbly as almost to deceive himself and the reader he makes love as he believes the perfect lover should 1ut all the time he does not love and cannot love he is unable to resist the wiles of the tempter provided the temptation is shrouded with sentimental wrappings at times he is aghast at the situations into which his besetting weakness lands him he escapes so often that he becomes convinced at last that his little gods as he calls them will always rescue him from the consequences of his actions tommys great book upon woman brings him fame and popularity he becomes the pet of society carried away by one of his sentimental impulses he proposes to a widow whom he hardly knows to his immense relief she refuses his offer tommy flees to thrums when the hot fit is over and he realises the peril he has so narrowly escaped tommy however is only a secondary personage in the stor although mr barrie probably intended he should occupy the foreground grizel of the crooked smile the child of the painted lady grown to womanhood is the pathetic human figure around which the story revolves she is passionately devoted to the truth clearsighted and endowed with a horror of all makebelief pretence and sham it is pain to grizel if she cannot answer yes or no to a question tommy always avoids a direct answer and shirks anything that threatens to draw a dividing line between truth and falsehood grizel falls in love with tommy irresolute tommy lets her think he loves her but when the way is cleared of all obstacles to their marriage he recoils in dismay with a touching proud humility grizel refuses to bind himdo you mean you dont love me she said  you must tell me what you mean that is how others would put it he replied  i believe they would be wrong i think i love you in my own way but i thought i loved you in their way and that is the only way which counts in this world of theirs it does not seem to be my world i was given wings i think  but i am never to know that i have left the earth until i come flop upon it with an arrow through them i crawl and wriggle here and yet he laughed harshly i believe i am rather a fine fellow when i am flying   she nodded y you mean you want me to let you off she asked you must tell me what you mean and as he did not answer instantly  because i think i have some little claim upon you she said with a pleasant smile  i am as pitiful a puzzle to myself as i can be to you lhe replied  all i know is that i dont want to marry any one and yet i am sure i could die for you grizel it was quite true a burning house and grizel among the flames and he would have been the first on the ladder but there is no such luck for you tommy  you are free was what she said  dont look so tragic she alded again with the pleasant smile  it must be very distressing to you butyou will fly again 11er lips twitched tremulously  i cant fly she said there arc many tommies in the world and it is unfortunate that they have so strong an attraction for the grizels it is the grizels whose lives are spoiled and whose loving selfsacrifice is lavishly but vainly squandered upon the men who are not worthy to kiss the hem of their garments poor patient grizel is finally driven insane by tommys heartless and thoughtless behaviour tommy is fond of posing as a martyr but he is not of the stuff of which martyrs are made in remorse it is true he marries grizel and by months of devotion and care he wins her back to sanity but although he acts the part of the perfect lover he knows he does not really love and he hugs the conviction that he is a very fine fellow to sacrifice himself in this noble fashion temptation crosses his path and with hardly a struggle he falls lthe temptation is baited with a lost mis the one thing in life to which he is genuinely devoted and he promptly throws good resolutions selfrespect and everrestraining influence to the winds happily a kindly merciful providence interferes and cuts short his life once more his  little gods  save him by the desperate remedy of dispatching him from this life but from first to last it is grizel upon whom the readers eyes are fixed and it is she who wvill live when the memory of tommynv like the fame of his works has perished casseilsl 6s  tommy and grizel by a e av mason i am a man of sentiment only said tommy and there is nothing in the world we know so noble as a man of sentiment on the other hand he is apt to give his friends grounds for much uneasiness and in that aptitude tommy does not fall short of the man of sentiment in the comedy it is not to be thought however that any fuller comparison can fitly be drawn between tommy and joseph surface joseph is merely the coiner and utterer of sentiments with a view to material benefits when he postures he does so deliberately for the purposes of gain he is a plotter an intentional hypocrite with a character as black as his invariable clothes tommy however is as he confesses a man of sentiment only he would be different if he could but the creations of his fancy are the real things to him they are so real that let but a chance sentence set his imagination at work and at once he will allot to his best friend a horrible accident and a wooden leg and in order to heighten the artistic effect make that friends wife herself a friend and an old play 1 tommy and grizel by j m barrie 6s cassell mate elope with a soldier there was no unfriendliness in the invention of that storytommy whatever his faults was gentle and staunch to his friendshe even wept over it so pitiful and sad was it but he was a boy at play and could never grow up one may take another instance tommy saved a boys life at the risk of his own by plunging into a whirlpool and made a secret of his bravery the boys grandmother a brittle old lady who creaked as she walked and cracked like a whinpod in the heat discovers the preserver and having tramped the country round for ten miles to get the finest hen for a reward brings it to tommy at a moment when he is being entertained at a teaparty the old lady falls on her knees before tommy kisses his hand and pours out her thanks what was tommy doing the while he was excitedly planning the old ladys future here are his thoughts  he was a poor man but she was to be brought by him into thrums to a little cottage overgrown with roses no more hard work for those dear old hands she could sell scones perhaps she should have a cow hie would send the boy to college and make a minister of him she should yet hear her grandson preach in the church to which as a boy tommy you see was himself a boy he was always more captain stroke of the jacobites lair than t sandys esq the celebrated author he could feel aglow with the passion he had inspired but there was his limit he played so many parts he was so many characters that he had not a character of his own tommy was summarised a good many centuries ago in platos republic it will be remembered what sort of answer plato gave to the question as to the position to be allotted to the artist in his perfect state when the artist was seen coming the chief men were to put on their best clothes and go out to meet him they were to receive him with music and all imaginable honours they were to crown him with flowers and tell him what an entirely delightful person he was and then they were to conduct him through the town to the further gate and mention that there was another city a few miles down the road where he would be very comfortable and why because he played too many parts he was not a good citizen mr barries book might almost be a commentary on that the cover of mr barries first book  beiter dead reproduced by the courtesy of f a atkins esq  and vet i have a sentimental interest in better dead for it was my

purchaser she was a pretty girl and it lay on a bookstall and she read some pages and smiled and then retired and came back and began another chapter several times she did this and i stood in the background trembling with hope and fear at last she went away without the book but i am still of opinion that had it been just a little bit better she would have bought it from the introduction to the collected edition of the novels tales and sketches of j m barrie london hodder and stoughton passage in the republic tommy was not a good citizen and the tragedy of the story lies in the facts that he knew it that he struggled to become one and that he failed the pathos of the story lies in the fact that he was not the most margaret ogilvy mr j m barries mother she is up now and dressed in her

bayriy hurt by the failure but that a woman was tonmny could always go back and play until in playing he met his death grizel could not play she wanted to admire tommy but she couldnt on the other hand she could love and if you wish to know what love meant to her you must read that delicate idyll  by prosen water you must learn how he hurt her and how in spite of her hurt  shamed as a dog stealing back after it had been whipped she returned to him and how tommy set himself gallantly to work to give her back her pride and selfrespect you must read how she received her first loveletter and of her terrible journey into switzerland it would be easy to expend superlatives upon mr barries delineation of grizel she is drawn with all his insight all his tenderness he suggests rather than describes her in a passage of great beauty  at the time of the doctors death she was nineteen tal and graceful and very dark and pale when the winds of the day flushed her cheek she was beautiful but it was a beauty that hid the mystery of her face the sun made her merry but she looked more noble when it had set then her pallor shone with a soft radiant light as though the mystery and sadness and serenity of the moon were in it the full beauty of grizel came out at night only like the stars  i had made up my mind that when the time came to describe grizels mere outward appearance i should refuse her that word beautiful because of her tilted nose but now that the time has come i wonder at myself   her eyes at least were beautiful they were unusually far apart and let you look straight into them and never quivered they were such clear grey searching eyes they seemed always to be searching for the truth grizel was the daughter of the painted lady and it was the memory of the time when she was a little hunted child with a great desire to grow up good and a great fear that she had that in her blood which would prevent her which made her first care for tommy tommy had been kind to her in those days moreover though she saw through the most of him what she saw most clearly was that she was the best woman to help him she could not help liking to be a mother to men she wanted them to be the most noble characters but completely dependent on her as far as tommy was concerned she would have silently stood aside but for that episode of the glove the episode is typical of their rela tions one to the other it was her glove tommy had carried it about with him wrapped up in silk paper when he plunged into the pool at the risk of his life he had said to corp his companion give her that and tell her it never left my heart he tries to hinder her from afterwards discovering the glove lest she should be hurt by the thought that she had caused him pain all this she knows and she holds the glove proof positive to her of tommys love what she did not know was how tommy came to carry about that glove it was after she had grieved him so much by telling him frankly she could not admire him that he found it and put it into his there it lay unknown to her he knew that he must not even ask them to bury it with him in his grave this was a little thing to ask but too much for him he saw his effects being examined after all that was mortal of t sandys had been consigned to earth and this pathetic little glove coming to light ah then then grizel would know by the way what would she have known i am sure i cannot tell you nor could tommy forced to face the question in this vulgar way have told you yet whatever it was it gave him some moist moments but tommy is not all a sham and he sets himself resolutely to conquering his sentiment he believes himself to have conquered and then one tragic moment reveals him unmistakably to grizel and to himself a remarkable book as  tommy and grizel  is from beginning to end the chapter in which tommys sister elspeth accepts david gemmells hand leaving tommy free to marry is perhaps the most remarkable part of it there is a moment of sheer tragedy which comes upon the reader unexpectedly and yet comes as one sees in the quite natural sequence for the novel it should be said is not a mere analysis however searching and true of certain characters it is far more than that for it is also the story which results from the cl ish of these characters tommy a window in thrums from photo by valentine and sons dundee  from the attic i could see nearly all thrumsa window in thrums and grizel are by nature antagonistic grizel can love with every pulse of blood in her veins but she cannot be the child at play tommy must play and would love if he could the woman is not faultless she can sink below the level of faultless selfrespect she can also be too masterful for her knowledge she is human nor on the other hand is tommy all faults mr barrie who writes with the good humour of a man looking broadly upon life would have us pity him he has enough manliness to make a fullgrown man were it not overbalanced by his sentiment his first feeling when he sees grizel grown into a woman is  an unselfish delight in her for her own sake when he views in her face the love which he has awakened the artist in him is entranced as if he had written an immortal page but the man is appalled he could draw back at that moment but only at her expense and so he does not one could quote many instances of a like kind and otherssuch as his patient tending of grizel during the eighteen months when her mind was cloudedwhere the manliness and the sentiment are cunningly combined into one motive but the book must be read for it is one in which the characters create the story and are themselves only fully revealed by its development and it will be read it has all the idyllic qualities of mr barries former work his humour is as fresh as when he first took the town his style as limpid but in tommy and grizel there is more you will find in the novel the tragic irony of the ancient poets and you will find it unaccompanied with any bitterness there is not merely humanity and delicacy in the portraiture of the individuals but their fortunes are treated with that breadth of view which as far as one can judge is a necessary quality of the enduring book it remains to be said that those who followed tommys boyhood will renew their acquaintanceship with his playmates corp has become a railway porter and gavinia is his wife but prosperity has not spoiled them you will see again the pathetic figure of aaron latta crouching alone over his fire and witness another encounter between mr cathro and tommie and when the book is at last laid down you will have to add another to your familiar friends in thrums for grizel of the crooked smile lived there as for tommy you may in the end be in doubt as to whether you will class yourself as a tommy or a tummy but the application of that remark you must the book to undermtand	englishfiction

name among poetesses this we think may be gathered from her perpetual resort to trope and symbolfrom the garniture with which she can clothe some flimsy bit of worldly wisdomfrom her perpetual and we apprehend almost involuntary recurrence to the phraseology of scripture had this novel owned any other parentage its title might have led us to expect a narration of the notable murders done by a necklace or the eavesdroppings of an earring but we knew that mrs gore was about to treat us to a brilliant woman contrasted with one of tenderlydelicate nature and thus accordingly it comes to pass

B2148	['8530668']	  molly bawn lcty bavrn by thc author of  phyllis london smith and elder we must commence by drawing a distinction between a coquette and a flirt lest such praises as we are inclined to bestow upon the heroine of this book should bc misunderstood and interpreted as approval of the general practises of flirtation a coquet ti1 likes admiration anel so does a flirt and both of them are induced to go out of their way to seek it but the coquette seeks admiration and strives to make herself attractive rather for the sake of flattering her own vanity and of being a focus of attraction to the other sex the flirts ulterior aim is to win love which she does not reciprocate it is for this that she courts admiration when she has won the love at which she has been aiming she is content to throw it away and to seek a new conquest the coquette need not have any arrure pewee of winning real affection homage not love is what she craves if she finds that she has unwittingly won the latter she is apt to draw in her horns and tobe dismayed at the results of her folly she likes attentions but not intentions and admiration without affection the two terms are often used synonymously yet if a difle renee does exist it is such as we have stated the flirt is heartless and selfish thc coquette impulsive anel vain but nothing worse having thus defined we may premise that molly bawn is a thorough lil le coquette her coquetry may almost bc called artless yet coquetry it undoubtedly is she is pretty aud she is aware of the fact what young lady is so gifted anel withal unconsious of her endowmentr her temperament is foreshadowed in the opening chapter where she and her halibrother and sisterinlaw are awaiting the arrival of the guest who is to be mollys fate hereafter tired of waiting for this late arrival molly stares at herself in a glass and laments that she has  taken such pains with her hair and attire generally then she says to her brother  john since t hero is no one else to admire nie do say whether you think it or net i am the prettiest person you ever saw molly strikes up a warm friendship with the newcomer luttrell within a few hours of his arrival she at once confesses herself overjoyed at his arrival but the reason she assigns is characteristic of herif you only knew as well as 1 do the terrible neverending dullness of this place you would undtstand how one could long for the coming of any tii like congreves fair amoret molly is coquette aad cy at once she likes to be admired and to receive att nt lons  she might doubtless would lee styled forward by ni 1 ni ii ls and straitlaced people but she is coy of winning love and even at tie idea of awakening it yet she recounts t  luttrell with narre candour the diverse proposals which she even at nineteen has already received from the successive imiits of the parish and other admirers luttrell is soon hopehvsly in love yet it is some time before molly reciprocates his affections but a temporary tiff between them brings malters to a climax and he proposes she accepts him ritt somo momentary hesitation but shows thc real ntate of ber feelings when she says to bc made love to always every day would hill me ncverthc less they are engaged and before luttrell leaves moll receives an invitation to visit her grandfather a wealthy landed proprietor wdiom old age ill health and illtemper combined have made a misanthropical tyrant mollys mother committed a mesalliance as an amherst in old mr amhersts eyes when she became the second wife of mr massercene an irish gentleman of small means and though she was his favourite daughter he foreswore all further communication with her till now he has ignored molly and two other grandchildren marcia amherst and philip shadwell stand highest in his good graces waiting eagerly to stand in his shoes when he shall pass over to the majority these two have engaged themselves to each other the old man realises the motives of their devotion to him and his goodwill is not increased by the discovery of a halffinished letter from marcia to her mother lamenting her grandfathers tenacity of life nor by learning that shadwell is speculating upon his expectations by means of post obits molly soon carries all before her at herst royal where luttrell soon joins the party her coquetry conquers shadwell and also one plantagenet potts whose name and characteristics of ugliness and gooel nature are hardly original we fear molly is however pained when she finds that she has wron philip shadwells love and strives to keep him at a distance luttrell is naturally jealous and wc are afraid to say how many lovers quarrels are recorded between them thrice at least in thc course of the book is their engagement broken off only to be speedily renewed with increased warmth when molly coaxingly rubs her cheek against lu trolls sleeve like a spaniel courting a caress the citadel surrenders unconditionally we can hardly say that we should like a sister or daughter of ours to play the hoyden as does molly lest wrorse should befall them  and yet we must confess that there is a charin in the wayward and coquettish heroine which makes us condone as soon as we have censured when her love has once been really kindled she is devoted to luttrell though the latters expectations are meagre while philip shadwell her cousin is heir presumptive to the twenty thousand a year of herst royal so soon as his grandfather shall be good enough to take his departure we cannot say that molly is an unnatural character we have actually known girls more or less like her whose coquetry was only skin deep and whose affection was wann trusting sincere and honest it is part of the licence of an author to combine this amount of eccentricity of character with faultlessness of face and figure and with a voice that entrances all who hear her sing admitting that a molly bawn is a possible though a very rare occurrence in life we may then say that the story has a natural and unaffected tone throughout and that thc reality of the conversations and predicaments and thc absemcc of artificiality in thc other characters which compose the setting to this jewel are quite refreshing after thc amount of trashy novels which it has been our fate to wade through of late if the tone of the conversations were less natural and thc pictures less artistically drawn molly might at once appear a flirt whose good points were inconsistent with her predilections there is no striking incident throughout thc book  the interest depends upon the vivacity of the narration to which we give all credit thc several walking gentlemen and ladies play their parts well and keep the piece going admirably there is a good comedy of errors wherein a sir penthony stafford has to woo and win his own wife whom he has married without previous acquaintance and under a special agreement that so soon as the ceremony was over they should separate for ever a curious will of an uncle which made their marriage the sole condition of succeeding to his estate is thc reason assigned for this eccentric arrangement but wc must parenthetically state that legally the conditions would have been inoperative in the absence of specific trusts of which the author makes no mention this sort of will is a favourite though impossible resource of novelists how molly breaks her silken fetters with luttrell only to rivet them anew how her brother dies suddenly and leaves her and his family destitute how she disdain her grandfathers offer that she shall live with him al his heiress and leave her sisterinlaw to starve how 6he becomes a star upon the stage of the concertroom in order to support his brothers wielow and family  how in the end she find herself mistress of herst royal anel the inevitable sequel results we recommend our readers to study for themselves the book though it portrays coquetry is singularly free from the least soupcon of coarseness and would not corrupt a girl in her teens which is a good deal to be able to say of any modern novel which at the same time has though faculty of being clever and amusing	englishfiction

season its defect which is mall arises from overimitation of mr wilkie collins the story is told in the narratives of three people like that of i the woman in whit and the solemn injunction of one diarist julian gower that tabitha tree for whom it is written shall not alter a word imitates too closely one of the weak points of the adopted model also for the sake of increasing interest olive blake while about her good work is made to perplex and grieve the excellent tabitha with mysteries that lead to less than nothing and that she can only explain by saying that it gave her pleasure to torment her friend seeing how nobly she bore torture and how faithful she was to her own heart in spite of every doubt thrust painfully upon it mystery so made is not legitimately made but in good truth mr jeaifreson is not dependent upon story for the success of his novel and if it were far more faulty in construction than we think it to be the book would be read with pleasure the most noticeable fact is that the inevitable defects of a tale told by triple autobiography are so far overcome that a man being the author of the book and two of the supposed autobiographers women they do absolutely write like women nice discrimination of character expressed naturallyit is easy enough to express artificiallythrough style would be too much to expect but mr jeaffreson sufficiently distinguishes between the two journalsone that of the active and brave olive blake vigorous in her i good work b7 labouring for years with fearless determination spending all her means to right a wronged woman though success proves her own marriage null the other that of tabitha tree whose womans life of disappointed love takes vengeance on the world only in smiling selfdenial and unobtrusive beneficence it is much that in the journals of these persons the sense of beauty in detail the minute notice of character the love of nature the merciful construction of evil and the faith iin god and in all goodness by which women make life beautiful has been preserved the book ts in direct con1 treat to that novel of mr salas of which we have lately spoken it is running over with the milk of human kindness which that writer accounts it clever to reject as lait ddnene used only by the sickly there is in tris stoyo olire blakes good work no trace of sickliness the faith in life is though expressed through the persons of women as manly as it is generous mr jeaffreson instead of proving that the men who please us are all knaves at heart pleasantly disappoints us here and there by showing us an honest kindly man where the experience of novel readers would lead them to see preparation for an act of villany solomon easys lawyer is an example of this and the good clergyman of the old school himself with  the corn  country  in which he lives the harvest felds he vists the lanes through which he drives ia his gig and his household with the two girls in whom the story cetre is a sketch more after the manner of the vicar of waked than of the woman in lihije we took up mr jeufreoms novel hardly expecting to be pleased for his book about doctors was unsatisfactory but the first chapters of olive blake at once proved that he has in him the right spirit of an artist and the wholo work convinces us that good as this novel is better will follow it unless the taste of the day lead its author astray into a de3ire for the couotiou of sensation  plots  olive blakes good work  a novel by john cordy jeaffreson 3 vols chapman  hall in olive blakes good work mr jeaffreson has made a great advance upon his former novels good as they were the story told is an extremely interesting one a story that will certainly be read through and in some parts more than once by any one who begins it the plan does not reveal itself to the guesses of the sagacious reader until he conies face to face with the solution at the authors own appointed time the reader will also feel compelled to attend to his own duty towards the book  to read it steadily as he reads a living man whom he needs to understand not to advance his knowledge by skipping intermediate steps under the penalty of spoiling his own delight in the authors labours the author docs his duty not only by providing a very interesting story but by telling it remarkably well there is and always will be a fascination in stories of circumstantial evidence there is the hunting instiuct roused to track a fact through all the doublings and windings of concealment a reader loves to assist at the unravelling of a plot or the detection of evidence for himself and not to have it flashed out to him in halfa dozen sentences of explanation in the last chapter where the characters are grouping for the final tableau of happiness and poetical justice previous to the fall of the curtain mr jeatfreson has selected the method inaugurated by mr wilkie collins in his  woman in white the main actors in the drama narrate their own immediate share of the business aud speak ol nothing but what they individually know and feel by this means the reader is kept from seeing too far before him the first part of the story is laid in suffolk in the corn countya district mr jeatfreson knows well and describes with the affection of one who is proud of belonging to the shires the pictures of the old rectory and the kuy quiet fertile country which seems always basking in the sun are charming the rev solomon easy in his canonicals silk stockings and stately silverbuckled shoes examining the villageboys according to the dtclaraticnes of the statutes of the benefaction is a picture from the life the old rectors drives in the ponyphaeton through the lanes and fields to see the crops and his mild childlike complacency at being told he can drive a bargain are all so natural that the reader finds himself asking the childs question is it all true  it is not till the middle of the second volume that he begins to suspect that he is in for a tale with a plot in it the early life of the two sisters in tue quiet rectory the motherly elder sister and her young charge julian gower with his brotherly love all naturally prepare the reader for what comes that the elder sister loves him with the love of a woman and does not discern that to him she is only a great comfort instead of a great hope the painful awakening that her childsister and not herself has won the prize and the loyalty with which she contends against her own disappointment keeping from all reaction of injustice and bitterness are made very touching aud very true mr jeafvreson shows his knowledge of women by a manly aud delicate reverence for them for which women will thank him which shows a far deeper insight than the supercilious display of some writers and some moralists who profes to think that dissimulation and inbred fa lshood rre the badge of all their tribe one of the very best passages in his book is where he goes rather out of his way to pay his own homage to give his owu testimony to their deive to be true und to do the thing that is riht the way in which the older sister bears her disappointment is very skilfully managed th readers sympathy never borders on contempt although we do not think that mr jeaitreson need have protested so energetically aboat her crimson blushes there was no cause for shaine or any sense of humiliation  she was mistaken but she had been misled by circumstances likely to have misled any one and she took up the penalty so bravely that the reader respects her as if she hod won instead of lost in the second volume the mystery of the book begius etty the young sister betrothed to julian linds out that she does not care for him lie is absent pushing his fortune abroad to enable him to keep a wife the grandfather had died some time previously leaving them in thc position whicn obliged them to earn their own living etty disgusted at schoolkeeping discontented with thc prospect of her long engagement elopes leaving no clue behind her except that sho is gone away with a military man elderly ugly taciturn whom nobody had ever suspected of being aware of her existence beyond though most distantly polite recognition the elder sister in the shanie and sorrow of the discovery abruptly leaves the cottage where they had lived since their graudfathers death and goes no one knows where to hide herself from all who ever knew her from this part the mystery becomes highly complex olive blake who has only once appeared before becomes ono of the actors  she marries according to a family compact the friend of though mau with whom etty left her home an excellent man of mature age she tells her own part of the storyhow after she had been a few months married she has a strange visitor a young and beautiful lady who declares that she is married to her husband now arthur petersham was the most unlikely mau in the world to do anything of the sort the reader never for a moment suspects him the character is well managed the reader is made to understand his powers of influence though he only appears in narrative and never in his own person of course the wife does not believe ettys story the marriage she asserts as having taken place at a certain church is not on the register her story is wildly improbable in all its details when her husband comes back she tells him the incident his explanation is perfectly coherent and satisfactory etty never appears again and olive blake never troubles her head further about her this is treated as her sin and we think morbidly exaggerated by the author olive blake is the least natural of all the characters she is too much ofthe personage so frequently met with in old novels who has a mysterious knowledge of every ones affairs and who interferes in the crisis of everybodys destiny that olive blake should once startle a person whom she had never seen by her shrewd intuition may be accepted but when it occurs several times it becomes a trick of machinery rather than a trait of character after awhile in her sorrow for the loss of her own child she remembers etty and is morbidly haunted by the recollection of her misery aud her own hardheartedness in though midst of this it comes to her knowledge that her husband excellent sensible affectionate as he has seemed to her and to the world hitherto without a flaw on his surface has in one flagrant instance at least and very recently been a profligate under aggravated circumstances and the conviction is present with her that ettys story is true without waiting to mourn over herself or to think of her own position she separates from her husband and resolves to find etty and to do her justice as she had ample cause for her own separation it excites no surprise or question in society and with mystery and secrecy and unrelenting persistence she sets herself to the work of unravelling the iniquity of her husbands wrong towards etty the difficulties are enormous all clue has been so skilfully and carefully destroyed so many years have elapsed that discovery of evidence seems hopeless the reader is made to assist in the search and to pick up and add link to link of the chain meanwhile the fortunes of the elder sister go on she too has hid herself with care from all who ever knew her she has to be found not by the reader for the reader knows all she is doing but by her friends she has to discover as she believes her sisters child to hear from a strange lady who addresses her in the park a story which is half of it true and half of it intended to mislead her into the belief of her sisters death after a life of shame this portion of the novel we object to very much indeedit is a fraud on the purest and noblest feelings of her sisteraudthough entered into with the best of intentions is so cruel so unnecessary that every reader will resent it because olive blake chose to play at providence what right had she to outrage a good and patient and deeplysuffering woman by a story she knew to be false and for the sake of effecting a possible good in an improbable manner  the elder sister deserved better than to be mado a dupe through the whole story olive blake in spite of her good work is detestableher character is not enough worked out to make her strange acts a study of human nature sho remains throughout the machine her conduct to the elder sister after the elaborate plot for bringing her and julian together has succeeded aud we hope she is to be as happy as she deserves is atrociousno other word will suit to try her fine nature to the utmost to see if she can bo unselfish and generous and trust her husband under the extremity of false appearances she goads her with suggestions of diabolical malice and when she has administered her tortuie till her victim faints she allows her to discover that she has been merely trying her olive blake being the mainspring of the book ought to have been made more like a human being or at least to have been developed with more care so that the reader might have accepted her for the sake of increasing his stock of psychological knowledgebut as she stands she is a disagreeable improbability as to etty the victim too much stress is laid on the accident of a legal ceremony it does not in the least lessen her wickedness  it only renders her less unfortunate and gives a reason why arthur petersham should find it worth his while to secrete her in a lunatic asylum after he had abandoned her and married another woman with all faults found aud objections made the reader will not fail to read the story of  olive blakes good work from first to last for the sake of the story and he will return to its pages for the sake of though many noble and

bright summers day with just breath enough of soft wind to bring the water rippling against the rocks below the terrace with a soothing murmur loud enough to mingle in a dreamy way with the hum of the cicalas in tme trees around and with the faint rustle of the vine leaves and to turn over and over again the leaves of the olives and send a silver shimmer over their sombre green here and there over the sea were scattered a few fishing boats their sailshoisted in the vain hope of catching the fickle breeze as it rose and fell gleaming snowy white in the blazing sunlight close to the monastery itself there was a narrow line of golden sand brokenat intervals by jagged masses of dark rock intervening between the vineyards and the sea but at a little distance the rich bright green of the vines mingled with the more sombre hue of the olives seemed dippinginto the deep blue water while every touch of colour along the coast from the gaily painted boat or scarlet cap of some stray fishennan to the bright dress of some coquettish peasant girl shone out distinct and vivid in the clear air on the terrace a young englishman is seeking counsel from padre felipe whose lofty and energeticmindhas

of machinemade novels and our admiration is hardly second to that of the traditional old lady from whom we quote when we meet with one bearing unmistakeable traces of handwork whatever heresies may obtain concerning critics it is nevertheless a fact that to be able as in the present instance to pronounce a novel original in conception artistic in treatment and thoroughly readable as a result does afford the reviewer most genuine satisfaction but we must sketch the story which has won from us so warm a meed of praise and in so justifying our opinion we shall be doing no injustice to the reader since to indicate the plot is to show the least charm of the book it illustrates the laureates ideal being the story of a boys  maiden passion for a maid which in the end  makes a man of him it is a tale of true love begun in earliest childhood and beset by almost every possible social obstacle richard talbot the son of squire talbot of talbot tower is the hero and when we ae first introduced to him on a visit to his grandmother lady earnshaw he is a wrelldrawn and very loveable specimen of an etonian of seventeen something of the schoolboy something too perhaps of the scapegrace and certainly all the loveableness cling to him throughout his history his father leads the life of a religious recluse stiriving to  live down  the sins of a dissolute youth and between the morbid man and thc highspirited boy there is much love but little sympathy necessarily thrown much for companionship into the society of grooms and gamekeepers dick naturally develops his strongly inherited instincts for their pursuits and perhaps quite as naturally falls boyishly in love with the bright beautiful little daughter of george parkes a gentleman whose antecedents are hardly worthy even of his present position in the squires preserves lucy and  master richard  are about the same age and some episodes of the  calflove stage are prettily sketched a kiss however which is exchanged and overlooked in most humorous circumstances brings affairs to the knowledge of the elders and to the consequent parting friends of course interfere  the clergyman and his wife and dicks  cousins and his aunts and even his own especial chum  pussy greene all protest in their several ways against the impossibilities ot such a marriage and finally the girl herself gives back her troth for a village maiden of seventeen it may be objected that she evinces quite exceptional gifts of sense and resolution  and we are afraid that the wisdom and tenderness which events subsequently show her to possess might be deemed exceptional in a maiden of any degree but it is nevertheless a consistent character throughout and a very charming one dick  gets over it to all appearance and goes to college is somewhat wild and reckless and when ha comes into his fortune contrives to dissipate it with alarming rapidity but through it all it is evident that the rare capability  to love one maiden only and to cleave to her is his and and in the end they marry and are as happy in spite of all drawbacks as such true love deserved the social complications which ensue on their marriage are extremely well told but hardly admit of quotation  handwork however is as evident in the sketching of the minor characters as in the distinct portraits of the hero and heroine we took an especial fancy to lucys good ugly

its attractions to us is the fact of ita being true to its title pessimism in so many forms ia fashionable nowadays that it is pleasant to be reminded in a roundabout way that we are after all less black than were painted the novelist in these times finds a larger audience than even the popular preacher and it is refreshing to find one occasionally who is not unmindful of his responsibilities and who holds the wholesome theory that in the long run  beauty of form has but a short start of cleverness and but a little longer one of goodness which once having overtaken it in the affections moves on with strides that the other can never rival v i p 59 we call this healthy doctrine and it is worked out without a suspicion of preaching which indeed would destroy the effect but as a set off
