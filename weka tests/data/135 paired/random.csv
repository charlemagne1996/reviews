mademoiselle mathilde new novels by henry kingsley i 3 vols bradbury  evans tins last production of mr kingsley will disappoint his readers not that there is any j absence of vigour or point in the writing  or any change in those peculiarities of style  which have gained him admirers on the contrary mademoiselle mathilde exhibits that delicacy of feeling that power of expression which distinguish the author from the ordinary novelist and which will always prevent his works from becoming tame or commonplace it is not then in the style of the writing that this book will fail nor in the way the history of the heroines life is worked out but in the very essence of a successful novel  in the story itself we must premise that in using the word fail as applied here we do not intend it to convey the idea of an utter failure but rather that mr kingsley will not create such an impression as he has done by preceding compositions the cause of this want of success arises from the story itself and this might be expected when the circumstances under which it was written are well considered mr kingsley says in his preface  the choice of a story was extremely difficult till in consultation one said tell them the story we heard at st malo and of which we have so often spoken since the thing was done from this we can easily deduce that mr kingsley contracted to write a novel that at the time the contract was made he had no plot or story or even any idea of one ready and that thereupon he hunted about and took the first that offered this haphazard method of selecting a subject to work upon did not deserve to succeed nor has it ever succeeded though it appears to be the favourite method of writers of the present day probably because it saves trouble how strange it is that novelists will not understand the vital importance of first choosing a good story and then telling it in their best fashion instead of acting in the manner suggested they seem to sit down to scribble with the very slightest notion of what their narrative is to be and trust to the brightness of their description and power of depicting lively conversations to compensate for deficiencies in the tale to start with it is always a mistake to found a novel upon a true story why this should be the case admits of many explanations but without discussing the reasons for it it is enough for us that it is a fact as is evident when we remember that historical novels have hitherto been failures even sir walter scotts historical novels were very much inferior to his domestic mdlle mathilde is no exception to the rule throughout the work it is obvious that the author is trammelled by his desire to adhere to the true account of his heroines life as much as possible and that relying too much on this cutanddried narrative he has not allowed himself the free exercise of that power of imagination which is one of his best gifts again the tale itself is too meagre and to compensate for this the author has been obliged to thrust prominently forward a lot of uninteresting and useless personages who bore the readerwilliam the silent for example that  this was inevitable appears at once when we riate what mdlle mathildes history really is this heroineand she was truly onein love with a young englishman and by him beloved sacrifices her own life in the french revolution to save her sisters this is the whole story of course it can be and is magnified to a very great extent but still details however well worked out and however numerous will not alter the story to use a poetical illustration in the fashion of mr weller an engraving by the new indiarubber process may be enlarged indefinitely without in any way adding to or diminishing the number and proportions of the lines in the engraving so here pages may be taken up with details of mathildes life in prison of her falling in love of her fathers servants and other like subjects but they only act as an enlargement of the original tale as we have stated it and we repeat that that tale is meagre lastly every one is tired of the french revolution to hear that a young lady was murdered by a citizen mob of the period hardly moves one so accustomed are we to all kinds of scenes of violence and horror at that time by a perusal of numberless histories we wish some author would for a change give us an idea of the brighter side of the revolution every one hitherto has delighted in painting it as black as he can till a sort of hazy idea wrvades englishmen that a good third of france perished by the guillotine or by murder daring the struggle when we consider the comparatively few who really were killed it is evident that the great mass of french people enjoyed themselves much as usual the whole time if a writer will insist on taking up this revolution again we ask him for the sake of novelty to look at it from the point of view here suggested in conclusion we may say that much as we admire mr kingsleys writings we can afford to wait a little longer for his next if he will spend the extra time on the composition of an original and more carefully selected plot,random

the story of stories by r c gillie london  adam  charles black 6s this is purely and frankly a life of christ for children the authors aim has been not merely to present a series of incidents but to weave the gospel incidents into a connected narrative emphasising  the transitions in his life and the hingepoints in his ministry in such manner as children may understand we have little for the result but praise the language is simple and unaffected  there is but slight expansion of the evangelical narrative and sparing use of the pictorial elementwhich is a good and infrequent trait in such attempts now and then mr gillie does not escape a violence or incongruous picturesqueness of phrasing in his expansion but this is infrecruent the story is at once clear instructive and well within a childs comprehension a good book is made further attractive by admirably chosen illustrations from the great masters calculated to educate childrens eyes along wkh their minds,random
the lawyers daughter tiie lawyers daughter by frank trollope 3 vols london skeet 1873 fc though we learn from the titlepage of  the lawyers daughter that its author has already written no less than four other novels we regret to say that up to the present time so great was our ignorance of contemporary literature that we were wholly unawrare of his existence after reading the lawyers daughter we are by no means sure that we have any great cause for rejoicing at the enlightenment it affords us what is to be said of an author who gravely and without apology introduces his readers to venice in the seventeenth century and to all the paraphernalia of cloaks and swtords masks and daggers which have been the undisputed property of the london journal since the days of monk lewis  there is a melancholy helpless heroism about the action which at once commands our respect and moves our pity how little appreciation of the time in which he lives must an author have to whom the historical novel seems still a fitting vehicle for amusement or instruction we could scarcely have been more surprised at being asked to read a new  grand cyrus or a fresh chronicle of amadis of gaul than at finding an author as yet unknown to fame and we venture to presume young offering to a public that feeds on mudie a story which uses again all the devices and machinations familiar in the days of anne radcliffe or g p r james quite oblivious of the oftenquoted advice of corinna to pindar about sowing with thc hand and not with the whole sack mr trolloxe calmly reproduces in one single work all the stage effects of an entire literary generation bloody tyrants shameful murders vows of vengeance missing documents entrapped maidens duels and combats of six incessant hairbreadth escapes bravoes outlaws monks all these and other familiar machinery are to be found in the lawyers daughter virtue triumphs over vice too in thc end in the famous old fashion but even this attraction will not wtc are afraid ensure to mr trollope a large number of admiring readers were mr trollope a much better writer than he is he could not force the british public to an interest in this sort of thing now elsewhere it is different oeeasionally if georg ebers likes to devote himself to the manufacture of old egyptian and carly christian novels he knows that in scholastic germany he addresses a larg circle of readers who will like him all the better for thc fact that there is no one else living who could combine the ability to tell a good story with such appalling erudition if on the other hand m xavier dc montepin or paul feval likes to drop back a few centuries and to clothe his  hollow puppets  in some more graceful garb than ours  if the eighteenth century delight m amadce achard or the sixteenth ponson du terrail these authors know their pappenheimers and they possess so strongly the art of storytelling that they must always be vivacious and readable  their characters wear well the garments of aa ancient epoch and if they do not differ much from the parisian of today they move about with thc theatrical easo and grace which he can wear so well either before the world or at the bal de it opera but we in england must frankly admit ourselves inferior to france in storytelling to germany in erudition  in other words we want nowadays both the qualities which best excuse the historical novel as well as the willingness to read it our writers of the present day will not take the trouble which is essential to such a work  they will not labour like scott or thackeray or bulwer lytton and they do not produce a  quentin durward an  esmond or even a  last days of pompeii they are not of course to bo blamed for doing the work that suits them best and we should be very sorry to think that england boasted a miss mulbach among her novelists the epoch of the historical novel is as far as we can see passed away in england and  the lawyers daughter is scarcely likely to succeed when  romola  failed yet there is not wanting a certain feeling of pleasure in an age of robertson and jules verne of teacup and saucer and the fairy tales of science in finding some one bold enough to take delight in the good oldfashioned elements of romance and naive enough to hope for a sympathetic and attentive audience one quotation will be enough to give an idea of the work presently as the great beu of the campanella of st mark tolled though midnight hour two tall figures turned the righthand corner of though old wall of st francesco della vifirna muffled in large mantles  and almost aa punctually two other figures also cloaked carno round from though left and both parties met on the platform and saluted each other if not cordially at all events politelyeverything being arranged between the seconds and the combatants placed with a fair regard to light though marcheso dobizzi dropped the point of his sword and said in a calm steady voice addressing the seconds  this gentleman the count st felix has asserted that the signora bianca grimani was his paramour which foul slander i declared to be a lie and i now stand here to maintain to the death though truth of my assertion should it bo my fate to die i wish you gentlemen to observe should theso be my last words that as i hope for salvation i do most solemnly belie vo the assertion i have made to be most true while the marches spoke there might bo seen a slight degree of nervous agitation in the features of the count de st felix he seemed to press hia lips hard and though hand that held his sword was slightly agitated however as the marchese ended he said in a sharp tone  let us waste no moro of that chaste ladys light pointing to though moon  for in ten minutes she will bo behind though campanile of st mark and our shadows may obstruct us  ten minutes returned the marcheso coldly  will bo quite enough for our purpose  ha say you so then havo at you my lord marchese and though samo instant though swords crossed this sort of thing ought only to make its appearance now in the weekly instalments of some obscure periodical were it as veil written as if it were by the elder dumas himself it would not go down but when it appears in a threevolume novel by an evidently inexperienced writer the anachronism is only too glaringly absurd wc should like to warn mr frank trollope that nobody now cares about old venice or the doge or the council of ten about moonlight squares and sombre streets about mysterious appointments desperate duels and the fierce hates and fiercer loves which charmed our grandfathers and grandmothers neither the melancholy lover nor the wicked baron would be tolerated now for a single instant thc lantern jaws of the one and the buff boots of the other will not meet even with the kindly respect due to their dignified antiquity but only with ribald laughter or unconcealed indifference no one now cares to walk in that imagination street where thackerays j j loved to stray thc street where lovely ladies look from balconies where cavaliers strike mandolins and draw swords and engage where long processions pass and venerable hermits with long beards bless the kneeling people where the rude soldiers swaggering through the place with flags and halberts and fife and dance seize the slim waists of the daughters of the people and bid thc pifferan play to their dancing who cares now for though fate of manfroni the onehanded monk for abellino though bravo of venice  whose eyes moisten now for thaddeus of warsaw or  looking on darkness see with horror the hideous effigy of death which makes udolpho terrible if mr trollope wishes to be read he had better either follow the example of his more distinguished namesake or make a hero of a gasmeter or a guardsman the path of literature which has been hallowed by thc tread of rhoda broughton he may not hope to enter on success there seems to be reserved for women but let him devote whatever talents he may possess to those subjects which the age will read to attempt to revive a taste for the historical novel is almost as heroic quite as hopeless and quite as ludicrous as would be the effort to resusitate thc niles of knighterrantry or thc institution of the courts of love,random
fiction sinister street by compton mackenzie martin i secker 6s t here are five hundred closely printed pages in t this book yet we are informed that it is but the half of the novel and that the other half will follow early next year there is nothing here that is not as it should be but we do feel inclined to take mr mackenzie aside and complain to him when we find that in spite of those five hundred closely printed pages the novel has not even begun it has not even begun in the most elementary sense of giving us someone to be interested in the present book purports to recount for us the life of one charles michael saxby fane until the time when he orders his thoughts towards oxford and the most exacting lover of detail will not deny that facts and details enough are given of the life supposed to have been led by that same charles michael saxby fane but the unfortunate fact is that he has not yet begun to exist he is but a name that serves as an excuse for an elaborate description of childhood and school affairs it is not until page 350 that some of the names begin to distinguish themselves into personalities and even after then the i distinction is not developed that is to say the characterisation is not worked out whether in terms of action or psychology and when the book concludes the potentialities of conduct and therefore of interest still do not exist when such a state of affairs occurs with a novelist of the promise of mr mackenzie it is interesting to see how it has been caused to be compelled to deny at the end of a considerable book that there is no such person as its ostensible hero is not sufficient that is only a method of evasion and if nothing else prevailed mr mackenzies standing as a novelist protects him from that easy device and when we come to examine the book closely an interesting artistic problem reveals itself that happens incidentally to concern in its implication a good deal of modern work in the novel for the novel is not a hotchpot into which anything and everything may be emptied the position of each detail is exactingly circumscribed by its significance any portion of any description that is not there for the better understanding of the central concern is just so much waste tissue and the natural result of the inclusion of such indeterminate matter must be that the central concern will be hindered in its proper development that sounds academic enough to be sure and though every defiance of academic statements is all to the good yet mr mackenzie does not justify himself there is for instance a chapter entitled characteristically enough unending childhood and in it is little that could not with advantage have been eliminated fane might have had to repeat mensa mensa mensam and so forth in a meaningless ceremonial we ourselves had to do so but we suggest that it is nothing to the purpose that we should be told of it fully we donot presume to say that to mr mackenzie that ceremonial had not some significance but he has not conveyed it to us and that is the test of the book in fact it seems to us that mr mackenzie himself has felt this for he bends his mind to making these endless details interesting for themselves by his witty telling of them and that is excellently legitimate though it does not alter the fact what is it to us that we should be told of the paper flowers that michael made at the kindergarten or of his difficulties with et and iny in the special  had these things with many other such details fully told been cut out would the book have suffered  we are compelled to answer our own question by saying frankly that the book in its present form would have suffered such details have come to occupy so large a part that the chief interest is derived from them and not from charles michael saxby fane on whose account they were ordered we are quite sure that this was not at all what a novelist like mr mackenzie meant he quotes at the outset the passage from one of keats letters to the effect that the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in a ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thicksighted that is as it were his text every external incident therefore only has significance in the degree in which it refers to this factor otherwiseof psychology but he has turned aside from artistic restraintor let us say more precisely his restraint in artand let himself loose in details that have not that significance with the result that they have crowded out the exposition of adolescence he intended have banished michael fane and reign in his stead yet even here a curious thing transpires for the events of the latter half of the book are in themselves a great deal more interesting than the events of the first half while being at the same time a great deal more in exposition of the personality that fane in consequence begins now slowly to acquire it is with the later introduction of michaels friend alan and the contrast that mr mackenzie now sets himself to display between the two that the wheels of the story begin to grip the metals but the whole fault of the book at least thus far is that it is not depicted from within outwards but from without inwards often not reaching the inner complication of nerves and desires blood and emotions and resolutions at all that is even the case in the episodes of adolescence though these are described as vivaciously as we should expect from mr mackenzies pert the lack of condensation has indeed taken off the vivid glow from his style but its general witful attitude remains though it shines no more and this is especially so with regard to the latter half it is not altogether easy to arrive at conclusions since the book itself does not our judgement is left like our interest in midair it would seem that mr mackenzie never intended originally to publish the book in two halves if he had he would probably have made each half selfcontained and selfconsistent and this particular half is neither one nor the other going lamely and uncertainly as a consequence the other half is to be expected next year perhaps the two halves will fit perfectly together and give each life if they do we shall rejoice yet at the moment our interest remains in suspended animation  fiction social studies sinister street by compton mackenzie vol ii martin seeker 65 another six hundred pages concerning michael fane  we will pay mr mackenzie the compliment of believing he could have conveyed in half the number of pages all that is essential to the understanding of the two phases of his heros life here treated wo can also affirm that there are few pages which do not carry the reader on with fresh zest book iii is a vivid presentment of oxford life though we are glad to know that detailed as it is it is not a complete picture the hero is now more than ever the young man cursed with the knowledge that all possible precautions have been made against its ever becoming necessary for him to earn his own living occasionally he is vaguely conscious of a desire to be something more than a consumer all his life  more often he is merely depressed by the futility of things as he sees them he takes part with relish in drunken orgies accompanied by a burst of destructiveness which would have been an outrage if carried out by a suffragette or a german but which many may consider creditable in his case for at the bidding of his proctor he cheerfully provides the money for the wages of those who have to repair the damage never does he reflect that his recurring satiety is obtained at the cost of many others who have no such chances his habit of oxford attitudinizing is cleverly conveyed in one of the authors comments he  consoled himself for the absence of subtlety or cleverness hi such an answer by the fact that at least it was a direct statement of what he thought once during his varsity career he is shocked by the thought that he may have some direct responsibility for the death of his mothers friend who had looked to him for sympathy in his failure to woo his sister in book iv entitled  romantic education mr mackenzie secures a striking contrast by plunging his hero into the nether world of london  down  from oxford and finding himself at a loose end  common to this type of man he turns into a musichall and thore learns that the girl he had made love to six years before has become a prostitute infatuated with the power of his personality he conceives the idea that he can save her by marrying her thus securing the opportunity to make a bigger fool of himself than ever throughout the two books which comsose this volume there are many ashes of intuition as to the contemporary leniency towards hypocrisy but we doubt whether the author meant to make his hero quite so criminal a fool in his efforts to help his fellows as he will appear to those who have to combat the misspent efforts of such people the heros friend is on occasion too obviously used as a stalkinghorse to draw forth clever disquisition and so has to appear more foolish than he really is our grasp of one character at least the heros mother is strengthened in this second volume    dearest boy i ia on though committee of a society for the abatement of london street noises   so deeply occupied with reform he said patting her hand   one must do something she smiled we thank mr mackenzio for that so far as his hero is concerned we cannot sum him up any better than we did in reviewing the first volume   his failing is the lack of a guiding principle sufficiently strong to counteract the relatively cheap allurements of life if he was as is suggested received into the roman catholic priesthood that mighty organisation may have converted a waster into a useful citizen if so it was an achievement more notable than any set down yet by mr mackenzie if this delineation brings home to any their responsibility for imbuing our enemies with the idea that we are a decadent race unworthy of our christian ideals then mr mackenzie will serve a moral as well as an artistic purpose we do not however expect so much from it the author with scathing irony depicts his hero as himself resenting  life given for the sake of thousands more unworthy living comfortably at home in the writing we admire most the authors wealth and appositeness in though choice of words on the other hand some sentences are in need of revision  sinister street volume ii by compton mackenzie martin secker 6s the temptation to write a long disquisition about this book is strong yet must be resisted space not permitting it and it is a pity for sinister street provides rich material for controversy itself touching upon so many profundities phases and ideas it provokes criticism to an unusual extent moreover it culminates in a conversion to rome this part is the weakest in the book for its reason is not obvious nor has the author taken pains to explain it one has to take it as it were cum grano for the rest the novel is genuinely interesting the picture of oxford of the good young man an english type passing through that delicious phase of youth is quite admirable then there is londonbohemian london the  gay life mr mackenzie is plainly half philosopher half esthete he can speak from the inside of women he is fearless sincere an artist if the conversion is rather temperamental than convincing it is suggestive as all the work of this author is he understands the lilys of this world altogether this is an arresting production a performance of literary merit  sinister street by compton mackenzie vol i martin secker 6s it may be that the dread prospect of the return of the three four or fivevolume novel determined the library censors to put their ban on this book when novels so popular as mr bennetts run into trilogies when even translations from french books such as jean christophe are published in england tetralogically messrs smith mudie and co may well have paused before committing themselves to the twovolume immensity of mr mackenzies new enterprise but these censors whose selfordained function it is to preserve the ignorance of youth have sufficient reason for banning this book if discussion of sex and sexuality is a crime any openminded reader of his novel will be convinced that mr mackenzie is attempting in a sincere and philosophic spirit to consider the supremely important effects upon character of the awakening of the sex impulse in youth this is very far from being the whole of his theme this influence is one among several supreme influences which he notes and analyses but it is a fact that he does give it a preponderance such as has probably never been assigned to it before in an english novel we welcome it as a sincere attempt to grapple with an important problem which not only every schoolmaster constantly discusses but which every headmaster in orders constantly preaches about in chapel before the whole of his school mr mackenzie happily does not preach for it is the business of a novelist not to preach but to present and to allow readers to come to any conclusion didactic or otherwise according to their fancy what we are concerned withbeing convinced that mr mackenzie has no arriere pensieis his truth to life and character he is addressing himself to a task similar to that of rolland in jean christophe and showing us the evolution of a boy who in the next volume is to become a mana boy sensitive yet masculine impressionable yet active ardent yet philosophic and brilliantin a certain sense a type and in another sense a superman or rather superboy michael hishers is the son of a mrs fane not married to that dimly shadowed father the earl of saxby michael and his sister stella are the loveproducts of this unrecognised union and both of them set out upon their exceptional yet representative careers we find it hard to be convinced by the psychology of michael the baby and small boy mr mackenzie probably resembles the rest of us in forgetting his own impressions at the age of two and in attempting to reconstruct the infantile phantasms of reality he is no more successful than he was in carnival or than m rolland was in jean christophe but no sooner has his hero gone to school than he begins to live for us as well as for himself this sinister picture of the foolish satire of masters the fashions and aspirations of small boys the keen zest for work and games and weariness of them the vast absorbing and sometimes hated institutional atmosphere of the school is a more faithful picture of publicschool life than anything we know in english fiction where mr mackenzie perhaps errs is in the emphasis he gives to certain exceptional influences in the life of his hero nearly all schoolboys are extraordinarily sentimental and extraordinarily religious but michael is a theologian many clever schoolboys are in danger of becoming aesthetes whether it be of the george moore or the oscar wilde type but michael outdoes them all nearly all of them are addicted to love affairs and take an interest in questions of sex but michael is more than most boys exposed to the violent surprises of knowledge but if mr mackenzie attends to this question very closely and actually gives it a greater importance than it seems to merit that is because he is attending very closely to all the remarkable influences which may be exerted upon an impressionable and exceptional boy we think that he has considering his whole scheme attempted a task which is rather too large for his philosophy but his characters are alive the school is a veritable hive of bees and drones we recognise it as a characteristic forcing ground of youth undoubtedly mr mackenzie has written a powerful and zestful book which the censor has advertised to the advantage of those whom he has introduced to it,random

the deud secret new hovels by wilkie collins 2 vols cranbury  vanswo injustice will be done to mr colling if we trace the outline of his story before estimating its qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin

from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight

consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window

new issue of the dead secret in our literary summnzar last week  btit a niore detailed criticism is called for alike by the justly eminenit positwn of the author and the sterling character of the work itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

the cloister and the hearth a tale of the middle ages new novels by charles reade 4 vols trubner  co whatever mr read writes is sure to have some good substance in it plenty of weft as weavers say mr read never grudges his labour indeed he seems to love it for its own sake in this present work he gives his readers plenty for their moneyand those who like to have a book which they may read in peace without any prospect of coming too speedily to the end and without any possible prevision of what the end will turn out to be may here find a story to their mind  the cloister and the hearth is full to overflowing of adventures of the most marvellous and heartthrilling description dangers so imminent and escapes so hairbreadth that the reader will feel almost as nervous as if they had ended fatally the time is in the middle of the fifteenth century the scene is laid in many places for there is a great deal of travelling both by land and waterbut holland and italy are the places where the people most concerned in the story transact the chief part of their affairs the description of the little town of tergou in holland where elias and catherine the father and mother of the hero gerard reside and the account of their domestic life are like an old flemish interior brought intoaction catherinethe kindhearted honest prejudiced thrifty housewife with her harsh rind and tender core is charming and lifelikeelias with his sternness silence and love of justice is equally goodboth axe true to their own nature and look like a pair of portraits by cranach mr read has caught the spirit and colour of the age he has selected in all the conversations actions manners and customs the reader is taken back to the everyday life of that age it was the very eve of the reformation the printingpress had just become an accomplished fact and was beginning to send abroad its first winged sheets luther was not born but the time was fast ripening for his appearance it is a period full of interest to us we are familiar with it and in mr reades pages it wears the kindly aspect of an oldremembered time instead of toeing a stiff imitation of a bygone state of things the characters are all warm the descriptions are vivid the tone of thought and the turn of speech are consistent and probable the first volume is the best there is more actionthe story moves briskly and the foundation of it is well laid giving no indication of its future course the loves of gerard and margarettheir dangerthe fatality that hinders their legal marriage when on the very steps of the altar their cruel separationthe escape of gerard are all told well and rapidly the description of the german inn where gerard takes refuge on though first night of his wandering has the air of being an interior drawn from the life but the details are far more coarse than was necessary and are enough to disgust fastidious readers there was not the least need to prbeuer all the horrors of the dirt and close confinement of an overcrowded lodging there nie touches of human kindness and good feeling put in which redeem them but mrreade might have done this and yet left the other undone with advantage as the story proceeds it begins to drag heavily mr read is more anxious to show forth his own reading and research in the records of the life and times of the age than to attend to the business of the story indeed his characters for awhile become mere pegs on which to hang the incidents he has gathered from books and the pedantry spoils the interest the knowledge he has obtained is not sufficiently assimilated  it is given too much as he found it as though he had copied whole pages of an itinerary throughout the whole of the second volume the story stagnates the style itself being quaint and deliberate aids this effect from time to time the reader comes upon a flash of melodramatic adventure that quickens his interest and these portions are effective and well told but though the danger incurred may be great though reader as he proceeds feels sure that though escape is proportionately certain there is an attack by robbers in an inn which is really exciting but when all is over the reader pauses to observe that the bottle of phosphorus with which gerard smeared the face of the dead robber and so scared back the surviving ruffians is farfetched and as improbable as that a traveller in these days should if attacked by robbers find himself provided with a complete photographing apparatus to take their likenesses and so aid the police detective in his search after justice gerards letter to margaret is good but far too long it is however an excellent panorama of travel as performed in those days the burning of the mill and destruction of the banditti is a fine piece of surrey or victoria theatre melodrama the scenes where margaret enters are the quietest and best in the work her reconciliation with the parents of gerard has some true and touching traits the plot of though two brothers of gerard is well indicated and it is all the more effective for being intimated and not detailed there are some good scenes in gerards life in rome but all are too long and want coherence there is a drawl both in thc style and in the story we object to though effect produced on gerard by the false tidings of margarets deathit is arbitrary and not in accordance with any previous indication it is patched on not developed from the character the effect on the reader is painful and does not impress him as true in any way the recognition of margaret is a strongly marked situation but it is too violent and the subsequent portion of the story drags painfully the readers sympathy is thoroughly excited for both margaret and gerard from the force of circumstances  but mr read protracts this portion without judgement or mercy the death of margaret is very touching and the intimation given quite at the end that this story is the history of the j a parents of the great erasmus gives the reader  f a sense of belief and reality in all that has j fc gone before which is highly satisfactory in t summing up our judgement on this work we j r must say that it has many merits but that j t there is a coarseness of workmanship which i 1 takes away both from the value of the story c and though pleasure of the reader the work j i contains materials enough for halfadozen j  ordinary novels but they need a thorough j i supervision and compression to make the book i as good as with the labour and research i bestowed to gather those materials together i 1 it ought to be we have not mentioned the j  character of denys the french soldier he is i amusing and assists the story in important  difficultieshe however fades out of sight as  s though the author had forgotten

interest and pathos writing english for latin thus runs the history on which the novel of the cloister and the horth is foundedwe give it in place of a summary of mr charles reades plot he erasmus was born at rotterdam on the eve of st simon and st jude his mother was named margaret the daughter of a certain peter a physician she was from zevenberge he saw her two brothers men nearly ninety years old at dord recht his father was named gerard he had secret union with the said margaret with hope of marriage and some said that there was a lawful betrothal that matter was considered a disgrace by the parents and brothers of gerard his father was eli his mother catherine each lived to extreme old age catherine almost to her ninetyfifth year there were ten brothers no sister of the same parents all married gerard was born youngest but one it seemed fit to all that of so great a number one should be consecrated to god you know the feelings of the old and the brothers wished that the property should not be diminished but that there should be a house for them to live together in gerard seeing himself in every wayshut out of marriage by the full agreement of all did as the desperate do fled secretly and sent from his journey a letter to his parents and brothers showing a hand locked in a hand with the sentence added farewell i shall never see you meanwhile the wife he had desired was left with child the boy was nursed at his grandmothers gerard betook himself to rome there by writing for the printers art then was not he supported himself but he was most skilful in handwriting and he lived gaily presently he applied his mind to honest study in greek and latin he made handsome progress and in knowledge of the law he reached to no common proficiency for rome was then wonderfully rich in learned men he heard guarini he copied with his own hand all authors when his parents learned that he was in rome they wrote to him that the girl whom he had desired to marry was dead he crediting that through grief was made a priest and applied his whole mind to religion returned home he discovered the fraud yet neither did she ever afterwards marry another man neither did he ever approach her as a husband but he took liberal care for the education of the boyof this care the brief chronicle follows  at nine years old he sent him to deventer his mother followed him custodian and guardian of his tender years the progress of the child the teaching of johann sintheim zinthius c are mentioned  here he reached to the third class then the plague vehemently raging carried off the mother the son being left in his thirteenth year when  the plague daily raging more and more desolated the  whole household to which he belonged he returned to  his own country gerard receiving the sad tidings fell  sick and soon afterwards died each died when but a  little beyond the age of forty with the touch of a true genius mr read gives form and substance to these notes every curt memorandum is used as the key to unlock mysteries and sorrows of a bygone tale of love and suffering in spite of the text to the contrary mr read gives a sickly little daughter to be a good angel beside the hearth of eli and catherine of course also he holds firmly by a certainty instead of a mere possibility that the child of gerard and margaret was born of a sacred union a betrothal before witnesses held then to be as binding as a marriage the avarice of gerards brothers by which he was thrown on his own resources mr reade for artistic purpose centres upon two and he relieves the parents of the shame of the lying letter sent to rome by giving to those two brothers and a hostile burgomaster the discredit of it but there is such good artistic reason for every small variation from the line marked out by the compendium that in some sense the changes are no doubt recoveries of truth on gerards  wandeyjihre his fifteenth century pilgrimage as a penniless copyist of manuscript

approaching holland the strong fixed interest revives the reader shares the conflict of emotion and passion between the opposed claims of the cloister and the hearth and finds an exquisite pathos in the sacred innocence of the communion between gerard and margaret they are husband and wife only in love to their son but during the last twelve years of their lives sublime their own passions into a pure eternal friendship not again passionate with human yearnings until margaret is smitten with the plague and gerard has but to die and join her in the grave we must illustrate the spirit of the story with an extract gerard having heard suddenly on his return to his own district as a preaching dominican that margaret lives and by what fraud the barrier was set between him and her has thundered in passion the curse of the church against his two evil brothers and withdrawn to a vacant hermits cell meanwhile there has been obtained for him the parsonage of gouda but he is not to be found till margaret discovers him then she attempts in vain to draw him out is even struck aside as a temptation when found by him in his cell but in the passion of the moment she had left her child there sleeping when she returns for it gerard has the infant not knowing it to be his own upon his lap in tender fondling discourse the brave mother they returns to her attack and in the priest

greater than her fear  nay take not on so she murmured soothingly and put a gentle hand upon his brow  be brave so so dear heart thou art not the first man that bath gone abroad and come back richer

have him tell her what he had suffered for her and he begged her to excuse him and she consented but by questions quietly revoked her consent and elicited it all and many a sigh she heaved for him and

the quest of the golden girl the most delightful heroes of fiction have ever been knightserrant homeless rascals and questing pilgrims so mr le gallienne is on a fair way to win our favour by merely refusing to let his newest hero sit and wait till his ideal lady comes along to go on a walkingtour to find a wife may sound a trifle too deliberate for romance but then grant a little allegory and it seems all right of his companions of the road we have rather more than a speaking acquaintance with three or four alastor it must be confessed is our favourite and alastor is no golden girl but a charming boy with the star of hope upon his brow and  little wings of haste upon his feet eager for life but life in the empyrean with all the scorn of twenty for the cold wisdom of his elders we should indeed have preferred his company on the quest but we had only the chance of a short meeting then after sundry adventures we fell in with nicolete fishing by the banks of a stream an independent vivacious rather overmature young woman of twenty at least so we guessed from her conversation but the shrewd quester quickly made up his mind that though she was adorable she was a little too young to spend his life with a few days however he does not grudge and in response to her request they set off together and alone on their wanderingfor ever she believes as the sun is shining in the merry month of may we following at a discreet distance prepare to enjoy their adventure enormously but such is their haste or our discretion that we never quite know what happened on the waysunstroke perhapsto reduce the independent and intellectual young woman to sheer inanity when the angry father comes to take her off his hands the hero has our congratulations if not our sympathy then there is sylvia joy whose petticoat and stockings hanging on a clothesline he fell in love with and whose further acquaintance he made when he was benevolently meddling in the affairs of a young married couple who had played away their happiness out of a foolish respect for theory sylvia is quite evidently not the golden girl in his haste he said she would do instead only she preferred her own good professional incomeshe was a talented dancerto anything but the most substantial chance of matrimony semiramis the american with her air of pathetic devotion to every male being within the range of her eyes he perhaps never took very seriously for though they went through the mystic rite of  pressing each others feet under the table at their first meeting that apparently is not the kind of thing the golden girl is in the habit of doing and meanwhile a face had haunted him a face set round with chestnut hair which he met one day on an  apocalyptic moorland he met it again years afterfor the walkingtour did not end his questin piccadilly and it was set about this time with golden locks the quest is at an end his one discontent is with the altered hue time can undo what art has done but she prophecies the death of their happiness when the chestnut hue returns is there symbolism here perhaps it is our own suggestion not the heros that only whilst an artificial light dwelled about elizabeth could the romance remain mr le gallienne will not kill the romance he lets her die instead his hero is puzzled over the psychology of this woman of his heart so should we be if we accepted his view of the matter why should he not love a lovable outcast why to explain his devotion to an unhappy woman who has fallen low should he insist that in spite of all her history she was a puritan  to read sundayschool stories and to think atheists the most depraved of human beings is not to be a puritan he should have the proud courage of his love or give it up besides the girls of a more or less golden hue this hero found some other entertaining things he discovered the foolishness of theory for instance and pleasantly illustrates the same he promulgates some opinions and theories of his own too which we may find amusing without endorsing for example that gipsies being now along with waterfalls and ruined castles  the public property of the emotions no longer touch the private heart or stir the private imagination  likewise  that there is an opportunity for a new  the quest of the golden girl a romance by richard le gallienne 59 net lane form of novel in which the novelist    will skip all the dull people and merely indicate such of them as are necessary to the action by an outline or a symbol another theory of his that innocence consists largely of unconsciousness of wrongdoing  is more relevant to our criticism we base our doubt of the converse of this on the very book before us mr le gallienne is not at all unconscious he desires and mean to be naughtynot wicked of course but the result is innocent enough it is the naughtiness of a boy in his teens however that is suggested not that of a man in his thirties good enough for fooling distasteful for sentiment mr le gallienne is not always fooling but the truth is we are handicapped in our appreciation of his fantasy by the too wide difference between his views of the romantic and our own we knew it when we reached p 48 where occurs the story of the love of the lady of the manor she was once an actress for the village schoolmaster they used to meet in the dingle and laugh and love and drink champagne  when it all came out there was a regular cartload of bottles found there the heart of mr le galliennes hero waxed soft at the tale i retraced my steps to the common and rambled up that green lane along which the romantic schoolmaster used to steal in the moonlight to the warm arms of his love how eagerly he bad trodden the very turf i was treadingwe never know at what moment we are treading sacred earth but was the lodestar of that lover the eyes of his lady or the glimmer of the champagne bottles  under the  cartload of these our feebler sense of the romantic was crushed and killed a m  the quest of the golden girl by r le gallienne lane life was to r l stevenson a road on which he walked in boyish quest of adventure and this attitude of his has been adopted by younger writers with irritating frequency here the idea of a walking tour in search of the golden girl or ideal wife suits the desultory and fanciful irresponsibility of mr le gailiennes style the adventures of the hero related in the first person are very loosely strung together with little confidences to the reader and reflections on the lack of progress in the story which smack of  padding at other times the author is fluent to excess his reflections on a single look are 44 similarly in that moment i seemed to have dived into this unknown girls eyes to have walked through the treasure palaces of her soul to have stood before the flaming gates of her heart to have gathered silver flowers in the fairy gardens of her dreams 1 had followed her white  robed spirit across the moonlit meadows of her fancy and by her side had climbed the dewy ladder of the morning star and then suddenly i had been whirled up again to the daylight through the magic fountains of her eyes there is more yet hut this will probably suffice and surely oaths barmaids ana whiskeyandsoda were out of place in a fanciful and frankly impossible idyl such as this mr le gallienne has enough wit and fancy to do without these wearisome adjuncts of some modern humour the plain sensuality of many pages the insistence on details modern taste has agreed to leave unmentioned is a much more serious matter sentimental journeys nowadays should surely leave out some of sternes effects there is here not to mince matters much of that odd and most uncomfortable coarseness which we are told on good authority distinguishes  the bright boy of fiction mr le gallienne can write a good deal better than he has done in the quest of the golden girl,random

tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he affects to adopt the opinions of duchinski about the great russian race he looks for the sources of his tales in any other direction at least two of the pieces given by miss hodgetts are russian bilini or legendary ballads the last of the russian warriors  and the celebrated chant of ilya muromets whose name is somewhat disguised in the form which it assumes in her book this ulina is interesting as giving us a glimpse how vladimir the first christian sovereign presented himself to the popular imagination in russia strange to say we find next to nothing about him in his religious character if we except his contest with the idolater ilya is the most popular hero of the old yolksepos vladimir is holding high court at sacred kiev  elie ilya galloped straight into the princes court jumped off his noble steed and tied

favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious stories we can only say that for

far from thc madding crowd by thomas hardy london smith elder  co 1874 far from the madding crowd is so clever a novel so original in atmosphere and in character that its brilliant qualities are likely to neutralise the glare of its equally prominent faults the writer has the advantage of dealing with an almost untouched side of english life his scene is laid somewhere in the country of mr freemans favourite seaxsaetas in a remote agricultural and pastoral district of southwestern england among peasants who look on bath as a distant and splendid metropolis it is likely that much of the old country existence lives on undisturbed the country folk in the story have not heard of strikes or of mr arch they have to all appearance plenty to eat and warm clothes to wear and when the sheep are shorn in the ancient barn of weatherbury the scene is one that shakespeare or that chaucer might have watched this immobile rural existence is what the novelist has to paint  in comparison with cities he says weatherbury was immutable the citizens then is the rustics now in london twenty or thirty years ago are old times in paris ten years or five in weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present and nothing hiss than a century set a mark on its face or tone five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter the embroidery of a smockfrock by the breadth of a hair ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase in these nooks the busy out aiders ancient times are only old his old times are still new his present is futurity no condition of society could supply though writer who knows it well with a more promising ground for his story the old and the new must meet here and there with curious surprises and our world may find itself face to face with the quaint conceited rustics of shakespeares plays such a story might be written as george sand has often told of the vallee noire sober characters and simple might appear in the foreground of scenes exquisitely quiet and harmonious in our opinion the writer of far from the madding crowd has only partially succeeded in making the best of his theme and though his failure is more valuable than i many successes he has been misled by attempting too much in his way of looking at his subject he rather resembles george eliot than george sand he contemplates his shepherds and rural people with the eye of a philosopher who understands all about them though he is not of them and who can express their dim efforts at rendering what they think and feel in language like that of mr herbert spencer it is this way of writing and thinking that gives though book its peculiar tone the author is telling clever people about unlettered people and he adopts a sort of patronising voice in which there are echoes now of george eliot and now of george meredith thus there aro passages where the manner and the matter jar and are out of keeping there are three circles of interest in this storyfirst the rural surroundings the effects of weather and atmosphere the labours of beasts and men as the lambing of sheep and such mild struggles with natures storms and rains as m victor hugo would scarcely find dramatic enough for his tremendous canvas next there are the minor charactersa sort of chorus of agricultural labourers very ready with advice very helpless and very much taken up with themselves as was the way with the ancient chorus last there are the main persons of the dramathe people in whose passions and adventures the interest ought to centre of these three component parts of the tale the first may bo pronounced nearly perfect and worthy of all praise we might instance the description of norcombe hill by starlight in the beginning of the second chapter as an original and admirable treatment of natureof nature which is more and more tending to become a main interest in our modern fiction we prefer to quote the enumeration of the signs by which the hero detected the approach of a storm because the quotation includes the sheep whose birth and death in this tale are narrated with great minuteness  the sheep were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes and the first peculiarity observable was that on the sudden appearance of oaks head over the fence they did not stir or run away they had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man but this was not the most noteworthy feature they were all grouped in such a way that their tails without a single exception were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened there was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar to which thc clump of furze bushes stood in the relation of the wearers neck  this was enough to reestablish him in his previous opinion he knew now that he was right and troy was wrong every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change but two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions apparently there was to be a thunderstorm and afterwards a cold continuous rain the creeping things seemed to know all about the latter rain but little of the interpolated thunderstorm while the sheep knew all about the thunderstorm and nothing of the latter rain when the thunderstorm bursts it is described with much pictorial effect and is a quite disagreeable enough trial to oak the english gilliat and contender with nature coming from though scenery to the chorus we are a good deal puzzled few men know the agricultural labourer at home and it is possible that ho is what mr hardy describes him the labourers are all humourists in their way which is a very dreary and depressing way odd scraps of a kind of rural euphuism misapplications of scripture and fragments of modern mechanical wit are stirred up into a queer mixture which makes the talk of henery fray cainy ball jan coggan and especially of that preeminent bore joseph poorgrass do labourers really converse like this  i look round upon life quite promiscous do you conceive me neighbours  my words though made as simple as i can nmy be rather deep tor some heads   oh yes henery we quite conceive ye  a strange old piece goodmenwhirled about from here to yonder as if i were nothing worth a little warped too but i have my depths ha and even my great depths i might close with a certain shepherd brain to brain but no oh no hero is another specimen of rural speech   for a drunk of really a noble class and on the highest principles that brought you no nearer to the dark man than you were afore you began there was none like these in farmer everdenes kitchen not a single damn allowed no not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there would have been a great relief to a merry soul   true said the maltster  nature requires her swearing at the regular times or shes not herself and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life and so on shepherds may talk in this way we hope not but if they do it is a revelation and if they dont it is nonsense and not very amusing nonsense leaving the servants and coming to their master and mistress we cannot say that wo are greatly fascinated with the persons or much concerned in their fortunes nothing could be more true or more careful than the study of troy the handsome sergeant with his half education his selfishness his love which he only finds out to be something like true love under the influence of remorse when the soldier erects a costly tomb to the woman whose heart he has broken and plants flowers on her grave in such a way as to wound to the quick the woman he has married we recognise an insight and a touch like that of flaubert but we cannot easily pardon bathsheba the heroine for losing her heart to troys flattery and to the glitter of his brass and scarlet indeed we have some difficulty in being much moved by bathshebas character and mischances when wo first see her she is stealing a look at herself in a mirror unconscious of the presence of young farmer oak when she hears that oak has asked her aunt for leave to court her and has been discouraged she runs after the exemplary man and explains that she is heart free then she sends a valentine with a seal marry me to farmer boldwood and so fascinates that apparently calm but really passionate rustic meanwhile oak fails as a farmer and bathsheba having become a farmer in ber own right takes him on as shepherd and has  curiously confidential passages with him at last the gay sergeant fixes her fancy with a display of swordsmanship and sho drives alone at night to bath and is married to him we feel inclined to say to her as mr buckstone does to galatea in the play  youre sure its innocence   the young ladys misfortunes deepen as troy spends her money and takes to drinking thero is a very powerful and strange scene between them when she opens the coffin of her dead rival fanny robin and her husband kisses the lips of the corpse and tells his wife that he only loved the dead it is a situation worthy of the drama of webster or of ford and wild as it is is lcd up to in a perfectly natural way this part of the tale including fanny robins terrible walk to her rest in the workhouse is ominently tragic and is not improved by the commonplace tragedy of the denouement we leave bathsheba wedded to the worthy oak a capital overseer and a husband who may be trusted we hope the babies were  put in the papers every man jack of them as mr oak promised when ho wooed bathsheba is so seldom on though level that her troubles with her husband raise her to that wc feel she does not decline on oak and have no sense of her as wasting her sweetness it is unlikely that even her remorso for having tempted boldwood would lead her into her foolish latter relations with such a man and on the whole we cannot look on bathsheba as a firmly designed character in spite of this want of success and of incongruities of tone tyar from the madding crowd displays undeniable talent which has scarcely as yet found its best and easiest and most natural expression in taking leave of an interesting provoking and clever story we must say a word in praise of though graceful illustrations a lang  far from the maddlng crowd far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy author of  a pair of blue eyes smith elder and co without making minute comparisons between mr hardy and any of his contemporary novelists let it suffice to say that this last work of his at once lifts his name above the crowd and gives him a position among the eminent few which it rests with himself to confirm or to diminish mr hardy is not a novelist to whom the exercise of his art is a bywork or a recreation it is clear that he has given his best energies to its service and has worked with faithful and patient zeal for his reward it is pleasing to meet with work that is so obviously the outcome of high aims and one should not be grudging in expressing ones conviction of the artists thorough success far from the madding crowd is not mr hardys first novel but it is so much more mature and powerful in every way than his earlier efforts that in them he seems rather to have been exercising himself with a view to obtaining a command of his materials this is particularly true of under the greenwood tree published some two years ago which the author called  a rural painting of the dutch school and in which he depicted rural life in an english county with the most loving minuteness and intimate fidelity of detail  a pair of blue eyes mr hardys next effort was not so exclusively pictorial it was a study of a more tragic kind with more complex characters and a more stirring plot but the evolution was none the less deliberate and every situation was worked out with the same painstaking and searching method both under the greenwood tree and a pair of blue eyes are very remarkable novels which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation and pictorial and narrative power of the writer but far from the madding crowd is not only an advance upon them in freedom and firmness of handling but it excels them also in concentration of interest and in spacious breadth and solid truth of proportion when the first chapters of  far from the madding crowd appeared in the cornthill magazbine a supposition was started that this must be a new novel by george eliot and the point was very generally discussed indeed if those chapters stood by themselves as a fragment of unknown authorship no conjecture could be more plausible they deal with the kind of life that george eliot has more than once chosen to describe to which in fact she has almost acquired a prescriptive right and the opening description of farmer oak is a portrait very much in her manner if the critic cared to go into minute corroborations of such distinguished parentage he would find them in the incidents of bathshebas unpacking the mirror and taking a survey of her beauty while waiting on the top of the cart and her higgling over twopence with the tollkeeper these little incidents have a delicate spice of malicious truth to nature which one often finds in george eliots pictures at the same time if we had read mr hardys previous novels we need have had no difficulty in tracing the authorship of  far from the madding crowd for mr hardys style is his own and sufficiently distinctive to be easily recognised one might mistake a detached portion of his work for george eliots but when it is viewed as a whole it has a good many striking points of difference mr hardy is not such a master of language as george eliot his style has not the same freshness nor the same eloquence and momentum and this difference of style goes along with a more deeplyseated difference of matter mr hardy is much less of a preacher than george eliot his interests are more exclusively dramatic he is absorbed in delineating character and tracing the workings of passion by minute touches and does not withdraw from his dramatic work to deliver his soul of pentup reflections with all george eliots impartiality towards her creations and her desire to represent each ones life truly as it is nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice the heart of the preacher is to be detected in her choice of subjects her characters derive a large part of their interest from their opinions and views of life now the drama in mr hardys novels is in no sense a warfare of opinions or ideas it is a warfare of persons persons moved by the primaeval motives of love and jealousy far from the madding crowd is concerned with no deeper mysteries than womens hearts and how they are lost and won its story lies in country fields and farmhouses and occupies itself solely with the secular and social life of the inhabitants whether we regard this as a merit or a defect or a matter of indifference depends entirely on our conceptions of art and its functions but if we hold no dogma concern  ing the functions of art and approach mr hardys novel simply as a drama willing to believe that it need not be frivolous because it has no great lesson to teach it is impossible not to recognise the novelists power the plot of far from the madding crowd is of the simplest kind mr hardys art does not lie in the multiplication and complication of incidents but in the searching and complete way in which he traces the effect of each incident upon the thoughts and feelings of his personages the central figure all through is bathsheba everdenea marvellously welldrawn and difficult heroine who unites ha iunlits of her biblical namesake to an inner nature  is     i ius maut vl inne fak curiously compounded of shrewdness strongmined irankness and courage and decorous imperious wayward womanliness the two little incidents that occur on her first introduction to us her satisfied selfinspection in the mirror and her obstinate refusal to give the toilkeeper what he askedat once give us the clue to two sides of her character the novel may be viewed as a history of a struggle between impulsive womanliness and worldly good sense all bathshebas troubles coming from her beauty and consequent waywardness and

seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the great mahseerthe  indian salmon socalled though he is one of the cyprinidse barbus tordoes not show sport in proportion to his size we have been seriously informed that he rises at the swallows as they skim the surface and may be taken by a hook baited with one but we do not endorse the statement among the characters to whom we are introduced is an old fakir the descendant of taj khan a former pathan ruler of the district whose story is well and

the ctip and the lip by lauija jinvry author of the forest and the fortress c in 3 vols london newby miss jrwrynsforte is in descriipon she paints with a pencil full of colour bringing before us most vividly the scenes and persons she desires to introduce to us her command of language is great and she writes with ease and elegance she is most defective in dialogue and from the same cause her wealth of words is here a hindrance rather than a help for it leads her to make her personages speak more after her manner than according to their own individualities so like are their talkings that but for the name it would be impossible to say who was speaking and but for the description what were the characteristics of the speaker this is not an uncommon defect in novelists and indeed there are few who can thoroughly accomplish that highest art of fiction in which it is allied to the drama and by which every speech put into the mouth of every personage however insignificant has an identity with him insomuch that upon reading it there needs no repetition of the name to enable a person acquainted with the story to say who is the speaker the same faculty it is which enables the novelist to construct original characters it has been supposed by some that the art of fiction consists in making faithful copies of living originals it is not so the suggestion of a character may be taken from the life but imagination will always be required to be called in to mould and modify it to a shape that will serve the purposes of the fiction in the cup and the lip miss jevry maintains the reputation she has acquired by her former novels it is perhaps the most interesting of the series in its story and it exhibits signs of progress a more experienced hand is visible aul there is more of selfreliance she copies more from nature and less from models if she continues to take the same pains with herself and never to be satisfied with what she hae done but resolving to do better still she will secure a very high place among the novelists of our time,random

barrington nir lever has chosen for the title of this tale a name dear to irishmen we might almost say symbolical of irish life and character but we hasten to add that barrington is no political romance it has nothing to do with the irish rebellioln or the irish parliament thougih the hero may have been a contemporary and a survivor of both as a personification of the virtues and frailties of irish life and character fifty years ago mr lever could hardly have hit upoim a name more sugrestive than  barrington the author of harry lorrequeri  jack hinton  charles omalley and the other dashing and delightful paladins of army and sporting life who were the delight and wonder of  us youth from twenty to ten years since has settled down into what painters would call his second manner and judging by the present story we are not quite sure that the second manner is not an improvenment on the first tlliere is certainly an advance in arta finer pencil and a surer touch indeed the change of style and subject is very much what we may conceive to be the natural growth of moral experience there is less of the rollicking animal spirits the reckless gaiety and adventure the buoyant audacity of the early time the day is waning and the shadows lengthen  the old fire within gives out a cheery light and a genial warmth  but the young gentlemen who danced and rode and fought and rioted and played and made love and took the world by storm antl gave a frolic welcome to all fortunes are sitting down to talk of other days over their wise and walnuts with hearts a little saddened rather than embittered and looks a little worn this is after all as it should be the niind of a man and the heart of a boy it is given to few to carry down with thein into the darkening valley of the fiftieth year to readers who are gorged with spasminodic novels and satiated with bigamy murder anjl sudden deatlh a book like barrington is at once a sedative anl a cordial it is something to escape from a society in which all lthe women have the manners of tlorifie barmaids and all the men of fifthrate melodramatic actors into honest and wholesome company in these days too when the old race of country gentlemen is dying out of the land to mnake way for an aristocracy who buy their ancestry in wardourstreet it is refreshing enough to make the acquaintance even  barrington by charles lever

barrington is by no means dependent on its plot for the interest it excites it has plot enough to make it worth te readers while not to know it beforehamid we are not going to display the curious malevolence of critics who suick a story like an orange and then throw the peel in the authors face we will only say that the circumstances which determine the course of this tale are ingeniously removed by the author to a safe distance from captious objections nothing can be considered iuprobably romantic in the adventures of a distinguished officer in the service of a native indian prince forty years ago  and the disputed claims which have arisen between his executors and the old company leave the widest available margin for the marvellous and the unforeseen mr lever makes somewhat free use of his indian accessories and the early life of the villain of the bookfor there is a villain and a skilfully drawn onestrikes us as a little more than wild even for the mabratta country but thl end of the story without shockingc probability too muceh is not only consistent with poetical justice but just what every gentle reader would desirehappy peaceful and full of promise as the glowing sunset of a clouded day it is not however for the plot that  barrincton  will be read with pleasure it is not one of those books which the conventional novel reader devours breathlessly at a

leaving the little cottagehome on a foreifn tour to bring back an orphan girl the indian grandchild from a convent in belgium the barringtons are preparing for a journey and old peters wardrobe has been displayed for inspection along a hedge of sweetbriar in the gardenan arrangement devised by the genius of darby who pases up and down with an expression of admiration on his face the sincerity of which could not be questioned a more reflective mind than his might have been carried away at the sight to thoughts of the strange passages in the late history of ireland so curiously typified in that motley display there was the bright green dresscoat of dalys club recalling days of political excitement and all the plottings and cabals of a once famous opposition there was in somewhat faded splendour it must be owned a court suit of the duke of portlands day when irish gentlemen were as gorgeous as the courtiers of versailles here came a grand colonels uniform when barrington commanded a regiment of volunteers and yonder lay a friars frock and cowl relics of those  attic nights with the monks of the screw and recalling memories of avonmore and curran and day and parsons and with them were mixed hunting coats and shootingjackets and masonic robes and  friendly brother emblems and longwaisted garments and swallowtailed affectations of all shades and tintsreminders of a time when buck whalley was the eccentric and lord llandaff the beau of irish society i am not certain theft monmouthstreet would have endorsed darbys sentiment as he said  there was clothes there for a king on his throne but it was an honestly uttered speech and came out of the futlness of an admiring heart and although in truth ho was nothing less than an historian he was forcibly struck by the thought that ireland must have been a grand country to live in in thu old dapy when men went about their ordinary avocations in such splendour as he saw there  nor was peter barrington himself an unmoved spectator of these old remnants of the past old garments like old letters bring oftentinics very forcible memories of a long ago and as he turned over the purplestained flap of a waistcoat he bethought him of a night at dalys when in returnin g thanks for his health his shaking hand had spilled that identical glass of burgundy and in the duncoloured tinge of a huntingcoat he remembered the day he had plunged into the nore at corrig oneal himself and the huntsman alone of all the field to follow the dogs   take them away darby take them away they only set me a thinking about the pleasant companions of my early life it was in that suit there i moved the amendment in 82 when henry grattan crossed over and said  barrington will lead us here as he does in the huntingfield do you see that peachcoloured waistcoat it was lady caher embroidered every stitch of it with her own hands for me   thems elegant black satin breeches said darby whose eyes of covetousness were actually rooted on the object of his desire   i never wore them said barrington with a sigh  i got them for a duel with mat fortescue but sir toby blake shot him that morning poor mat c and i suppose youll never wear them now you couldnt bear the sight then said darby insinuatingly c most likely not said barrington as he turned away with a heavy sigh darby sighed also but not precisely in the same spirit  let me passingly remark that the total unsuitability to his con dition of any object seems rather to enhance its virtue in the eyes of a lower irishman and a hat or a coat which he could not by any possibility wear in public might still be to him things to covet and desire   what is the meaning of all this rag fair  cried miss barrington as she suddenly came in front of the exposed wardrobe  you are not surely making any selections from these tawdry absurdities brother for your journey    well indeed said barrington with a droll twinkle of his eye it was a point that darby and i were discussing as you came up darby opines that to make a suitable impression upon the continent i must not despise the assistance of dress and he inclines much to that corbeau coat with the cherrycoloured lining if darbys an ass brother i dont imagine it is a good reason to consult him said she angrily  put all that trash where you found it lay out your masters black clothes and the grey shootingcoat see that his strong boots are in good repair and get a serviceable lock on that valise it was little short of magic the spell of these few and distinctly uttered words seemed to work on darby who at once descended from a realm of speculation and scheming to the commonplace world of duty and obedience i really wonder how you let yourself be imposed on brother by ithe assumed simplicity of that shrewd fellow  a  i like it dinah i positively like it said he with a smile i watch him playing his game with a pleasure almost as great as his own and as i know that the stakes are small im never vexed at his winning   but you seem to forget the encouragement this impunity sug gests   perhaps it does dinah and very likely his little rogueries arm as much triunphs to him as are all the great political intrigues the glories of some grand statesman   which means that you rather like to be cheated said she scoffingly i when the loss is a mere trifle i dont always think it ill laid out i and i said she resolutely  so far from participating in your sentiment feel it to be an insult and an outrage there is a sense of inferiority attached to the position of a dupe that would drive me to any reprisals  ii always said it i always said it cried he laughing the women of our family monopolised all the combativeness  miss barringtons eyes sparkled and her cheek glowed and she looked like one stung to the point of a very angry rejoinder when by an effort she controlled her passion and taking a letter from her pocket she opened it and said  this is from withering he has managed to obtain all the information we need for our journey we are to sail for ostend by the regular packet two of which go every week from dover from thence there are stages or canal boats to bruges and brussels cheap and commodious he says he gives us the names of two hotels one of whichthe  lamb at brusselshe recommends highly and the pension of a certain madame ochteroogen at namur will he opines suit us better than an inn in fact this letter is a little road book with the expenses marked down and we can quietly count the cost of our venture before we make it   id rather not dinah the very thought of a limit is torture to me give me bread and water every day if you like but dont rob me of the notion that some fine day im to be regaled with beef and pudding   i dont wonder that we have come to beggary said she pas sionately  i dont know what fortune and what wealth could compensate for a temperament like yours   you may be right dinah it may go far to make a man squander his substance but take my word for it it will help him to bear up under the loss  if barrington could have seen the gleam of affection that filled his sisters eyes he would have felt what love her heart

romance that mr james has produced the mystery and the interest are alike well sustained and the principal character delineated with a degree of dramatic power that i marks those happier creations of the author which stand out from the common run of fictitious heroes albert maurice the young burgher is a noble conception well filled up and in good keeping with the time when the demarcations of society were so broadly drawn and yet oftentimes so suddenly reversed the period too is one of much attraction the low countries have been our european nurseries of commerce and liberty they were the first to break up the foundations of that great feudal system which growing at first out of the necessity for protection which the distracted state of kuroio made necessary in the turbulence of its early darkness became afterwards so intolerably oppressive when peace had its claim as well as war trade brought wealth which was power and brought still morea habit of enterprise men saw the necessity of protection for their gains  hence arose certain rights and privileges wrung first from the weakness of some ruler who looked not beyond the present often revoked and often infringed yet the precedent once established became an authority for war freedom soon took a more extended view and out of those civic immunities and commercial protections grew those ideas of mans unalienable rights now so well understood and so generally insisted upon these volumes present a most animated picture of the period with its tumults and troubles its forests swarming with freebooters its nobles still looking upon themselves as earths savon red ones its burghers growing every day mure conscious of their importance  and the one or two of highertoned minds who inspired by patriotism planned more important schemes for the benefit of their own native lands and towns such are the materials which have been wrought out with animation worthy of those stirring days while the repose of so sweet and gentle a being as mary of burgundy is in excellent relief to the darker shadows of the picture the ensuing passages may show with what grace the embellishments are thrown in wc shall only premise that albert maurice is the young burgher on whose talent and influence with his fellowcitizens most ol the story turns 4 livery one knows that in the early dawn j of a sicilian morning the shepherds and the watchers on the coast ofthe messinese strait i will sometimes behold in the midst ofthe clear 1 unclouded blue of the sky a splendid hut de lusivu pageant which is seen also though in a j less

stern world we dwell in the mind of albert maurice had been excited by the scenes lie hat just gone through  and success without making him nrrogant had filled him full of hope mach step that he took forward seemed but to raise him higher and each effort of an enemy to crush him seemed without any exertion of his own but to clear the way before him such thoughts were mingling with other feelings  brought forth by the sight and the roice and the smile of mary of burgundy when the sudden call to her presence woke him from ouch dreams but woke him only to show to his minds eye a thousand confused but bright and splendid images as gay as glittering as pageantlike but as unreal also as the airy vision which hangs in the morning light over the sicilian seas fancy at once called up every thing within thu wide range of possibility battles and victories and triumphant success the shout of nations and of worlds the sceptre the palace and the throne with a thousand indistinct ideas of mighty things danced before his eyes for a moment with a sweeter and brighter image too as the object and end of ambition the reward of mighty endeavour the crowning hoon of infinite success but still he felt and knew even while he dreamed that it was all unreal and as he followed the messenger with a puck pace though vision faded and left him but the cold and naked truth at length after passing through several chambers which flanked thc hall of audience the door of a small apartment called the bower was thrown open and the young burgher stood once more before mary of burgundy lue of the most painful curses of high station is that of seldom if ever being alone of having no moment except those intended for repose in which to commune with ones own heart without the oppression of some human eye watching the emotions of the mind as they act upon the body and keeping sentinel over the hearts index  the face mary of burgundy was not alone though as much alone as those of her station usually

slightly while the lord of imbercourt himself stood beside her on the other hand and with his stately head somewhat bent seemed with all due reverence to give her counsel upon some private matter of importance how beautifully the next landscape is blended with human associations   lt was towards that period of the year which the french call the short summer of st martin from the fact of a few lingering bright days of sunshiny sweetness breaking in upon the autumn as a memorial of the warmer season gone before the sky was full of light and the air full of heat and the grand masses of high grey clouds that occasionally floated over the sun were hailed gladly for their soft cool shadow although the day was the eleventh of november sweeping over the prospect like the mighty but indistinct images of great things and splendid purposes that sometimes cross a powerful but imaginative mind the shadows of thc clouds moved slow over hill aud dale field and forest noss they cast large masses of the woods into dark and gloomy shade and left the rising grounds around to stand forth in light and sparkling brightness giving no bad image of the dark memories that are iu every heart surrounded but not effaced by afterjoys noss they floated soft upon the mountains spreading an airy purple over each dell and cavity while pouring into the midst of the valley the bright orb of day lighted up

been much moved by the details and interested in the fate of its leading characters there is we think more true dignity in the conception of the stories ami more chivalrous feeling in the knights mid dames of mr jamess romances than in those of any living novelist lie has the eye of a painter and something of the feeling of the poet he seeks to do justice to the heroic part of human nature and bestows beautiful forms and lofty aspirations he arrays the creations of his fancy in thc splendid costume of the times of the tournaments and throws what thc paintcrscall aline aerial atmosphere over the actions they arc called on to perform vc see too all that the mitbor sees his outline is distinct and bold  we are made familiar xvith thc motives as well as xvith thc deeds of his actors  and what is still better there i is a visible unity of purpose throughout to i which all parts are subordinatea certain  sign of true genius in an author we cannot i however conceal from ourselves that other  writers have excelled him in natural dolinea i timi of character in simplicity of narrative j nid in those electric bursts of passion which kindle all around like sunshine bursting over  a clouded landscape he is likewise a little too fond of painting scenery and describing  dresses and we could lind other faults hut were his faults doubled they are more than atoned for by his beauties among which tte have neglected to reckon a hatred and loathing for all that is mean and base and a desire to lift human nature a degree above the mires and sloughs of vulgar sensuality in which so many natures still delight to wallow the scene of this story is laid in the city of lhent the ehiefaetorsaro princes priiieeses and citizens and the time is during those  stormy days when mary only

and died when we have said that the chit i racier of albert maurice is to us original iind well supported throughout we have only to add that we think poetic or natural justice has been violated in his tragic end the author will answer that a narrative for which history had set up landmarks obliged him so to deal with characters created to help out the story this may bo so  still we consider it unfair to create ii noble creature only to show how handsomely he ctn be knocked on the head we are of opinion that though author has adhered too closely to history  it was enough to have caught its spirit and worn its dress without undertaking to perform all its particular actions,random

  malay sketches by frank athelstane swettenham john lane mr swettenham tells us in the preface to his informing sketchbook that he has aspired and aspired solely  to awaken an interest in an almost undescribed but deeply interesting peoplethe dwellers in one of the most beautiful and least known countries in the east he disclaims any intention of writing a book of travels in the ordinary sense and has aimed at presenting malay character faithfully without embellishment and without adventitious colouring it may be said that he has succeeded admirably in his undertaking so that although his sketches are not exactly tales they are as full of interest as the best of short stories could possibly be it is true they are not of equal merit sometimes the author displays the prentice hand  as in one of the largest of the sketches  the passing of penglima prang semacen which is decidedly prosy and involved though valuable as supplying evidence of malay character in which regard it is quite as worthy of our respect as any of the rest indeed apart from their artistic worth the volume is to be heartily commended because it is destined to prove a trustworthy record of malay life and character when the destructive influences of western civilisation shall have obliterated the distinctive features of the race as touching this contingency mr swettenham writes feelingly malaya he says raising his voicea prophetically land of the pirate and the amok your secrets have been well guarded but the enemy has at last passed your gate and soon the irresistible juggernaut of progress will have penetrated to your remotest fastness slain your beasts cut down your forests  civilised your people clothed them in strange garments and stamped them with the seal of a higher morality mr swettenhams first sketch deals with the  real malay and an extremely realistic picture it is in some of his qualities it seems that he resembles the englishman who will recognise kindred spirits in a nation fond of gambling cockfighting and fieldsports he is by nature a sportsman and is thoroughly at home in a boat on the other hand he differs widely from the english race in that he never drinks intoxicants he is a muhammadan and a fatalist but he is also very superstitious mr swettenham describes graphically that peculiar form of homicidal mania called by us  running amuck common to most eastern peoples but of especial frequency among the malays but mengamok idiosyncratic though it be is not so abnormal a development as the strange disease of frequent occurrence among the malays called latah it appears that no english authority has attempted to diagnose this uncanny complaint or to attempt its cure we must commend its victims to lombroso nordau and the alienists generally for it would seem to have its origin in nervous and cerebral degeneration the author cites many instances of this peculiar malady and in regard to two men affected by it he says that it was only necessary to attract their attention by some simple means to look them hard in the face when they instantly lost all control of themselves and would do not only whatever they were told to do but whatever was suggested by a sign  the eternal feminine  treats of a woman faithful to her spouse a white man unto death we are made to feel that this woman was exceptional rather than typical which was exactly what the writer intended us to understand it is an admirable little tale in the next in the noon of night mr swettenhams powers as a descriptive writer are fully demonstrated in this as in many of the sketches we are presented with pictures full of suggestive beauty and ripe with knowledge of the country described they charm us and rivet our attention one is tempted to quote to substantiate the statement this tale has also fine dramatic qualities though it is a pity mr swettenham should descend into cheap philosophising little short of drivel as he brings the sketch to a close there is again some delightful descriptive writing in  bez hautu where the author dallies lovingly with  the exquisite feathery fronds of the bamboo with the orchards ricefields and glistening rivers fading into mistenshrouded forest he is no less felicitous in drawing for us portraits of the malay boy  a thing of wonderful eyes eyelashes and eyebrows with a faraway expression of sadness and solemnity as though he had left some better place for a compulsory exile on earth and of the malay girl proud of a wealth of straight black hair of a spotless olive complexion of the circle of her browlike a onedayold moonof the curl of her eyelashes and of the dimples in cheek or chin admirable descriptions of tiger hunts fishing picnics and other native functions  and institutions conspire to put us in a good humour with the author one feels that he is a keen observer a true and seasoned philosopher when he keeps away from moralising that he is in short a man one could sit with profitably whether in the bush or round the social fire may his unassuming book have the success it richly deserves james stanley little,random

1857commencing when byron had only begun to assert himself before keats had published and when shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny when wordsworth and coleridge had few readers and when it was perversely held that poetry should be modelled on something that had gone before the varied reputations made iu forty years never seduced mr story from the path he originally chose beginning life as a northumberland herdboy he was  literally charmed by dr watts but springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration he dashed into a style resembling the minor flights of burns then as now most keenly loved and appreciated amongst an otherwise unread northern peasantry his poems are dated and usually have some two or three lines of historical gossip which

  the broom  squire by s baringgould methuen cvco no one who reads mr baringgoulds latest novel can fail to be impressed by its sombre force or the remarkable skill he displays in turning an exhaustive knowledge of topography to artistic account this has always been one of his strongest points but he has seldom been more successful in harmonising his characters with the scenes amid which they live and move and have their sinister being for the broomsquire may be fairly described as an exceedingly painful but not repulsive romance of surrey life a hundred years ago of one of the least unamiable personages it is said that she had a constitutional ungraciousness of the restalways excepting the sorely tried heroineit may be asserted that they are infrahuman in their callousness and cruelty the dialogue is lit up by a few gleams of sardonic humour but taken as a whole the tone of the story is painfully pessimistic and yet in virtue of its unconventionality its sombre picturesqueness and that touch of doomonic energy of which mr baringgoulds fiction is seldom destitute it never inspires fatigue but even in its most harrowing moments exerts a stimulating and almost refreshing influence on the reader,random
the new republic or culture faith and philosophy in an english country house 2 vols chatto fc windus for more than half of the present century english society and english letters had the advantage of being reflected in a series of halffictitious halfsatirical writings to which hardly any previous parallel can be found from the days of stagecoaches to those of telegraphs from the time when the english gentleman devoted himself to madeira and barouche driving to that in which he took to laborious reading for honours and equally laborious lecturing on things in general these books extended they were written by a man of extensive scholarship of much knowledge of the world and of sufficiently clear and definite tastes to give him a position from which to look ont and to criticize they constantly introduced wellknown personageb and always wellknown ideas and hobbies both the personages and the ideas were frequently caricatured but the caricature was alway so artistically done that it was of more value than the dull fidelity of any number of photographs it was difficult sometimes to recognise coleridge in mr flosky and mr mystic scythrop and shelley were not always identifiable and mr feathernest was clearly a libel on southey but there was no mere parody and no mere misrepresention and these stories from  headlong hall to  gryll orange have therefore never lacked readers and admirers though there have sometimes been brisk young men of letters who have fondly imagined that they had  discovered  peacock this digressive beginning is pardonable because it is absolutely certain that no one will read the new republic without having  crotchet castle and the rest constantly in his mind and because the merits we have noticed in peacocks books are those the want of which will be chiefly felt in the author before us he has imagined we give the scheme of the book because it is not reprinted verbatim from the magazine in which it first appeared a saturday to monday party of londoners guested in a seaside villa which their host otho lawrence has inherited from a rich and intellectual but improper uncle the story if story there be goes no further and the contents of the book are expanded to two volumes first by the device not altogether copyright of having subjects for conversation written on the menu of the saturdays dinner and secondly by the institution of a sunday debating club to cany out the ideas thus started and to frame an utopia in the good old platonic fashion these conversations and debates fill np the whole space with the exception of a few pieces of description after the manner of a nineteenth century  minute philosopher all the interest centres in the characters who are no strangers there is mr herbert who has strikingly original ideas on art and ideas still more strikingly original on ethics and political economy mr luke who is equally enamoured of culture of conduct and of his own very peculiar ideas of christianity mr rose whose sentences are of a marvellous modulation and in whose mouth the name of botticelli is no stranger mr storks whom the physical basis of life knows mr stockton who has both spoken and heard of  the infinite azure and the rev dr jenkinson who has silvery hair is great upon plato and does not at all like to have it supposed that he is not equally great upon the new testament of less notorious personages or of personages with no notoriety at all there are several of whom the most prominent besides the host a wellmeaning but feeble young man who would like to have a mission if he knew how and lord allen a variety of the same species are mr saunders a very disagreeable youth in pink stockings with a profound disbelief in everything but himself and mr j s mill and mrs sinclair a poetess who combines an ethereal aspect with some vulgarity the conversations turn first on no less alarming a subject than the aim of life and the subsequentlyfounded utopia is intended to give expression on each speakers part to this ailsa in the pragma of the disxjurae the accuracy of parody it simply aatoniwhing there is probably not one educated reader in a hundred who on reading most of mr herberts speeches will not rack his brains to remember in whioh of certain wellknown and now not easily procurable volumes they occur the sermon which practically doses the book might very well have found a home between the drab covers which issue monthly from a certain kentish village  and a speech of mr roses at vol il p 179 really sets one wondering whether ones own copy of some studies on strongly ribbed paper which appeared four years ago is imperfect or not this is all very well but it does not need demonstration that the parodist element is one which bhould be kept to its place and that that place is a minor one a parody in two volumes is something of a monstrosity and one certainly tyres of such a pro longed concert with all parts sustained only by the mockingbird nor is this the only charge which must be brought against the book there are some touches in one character wbich cannot but be regarded as the gravest possible offences against good taste good manners and fair play it would be a repetition of the offence to particularise them here  and they are unfortunately not likely to escape the notice or it may be hoped the censure of any instructed reader a worse fault perhaps artistically though an infinitely more venial one in every other way is the absence of a foil to all taheee intellectual personages there is indeed a certain lady ambrose who is intended we suppose to supply this want but as she is a mere woman of the world with almost all the usual defects and less than the usual brains of the character the contrast is too glaring to be good or satisfactory we want to recur to peacock a dr opimian or a lady clorinda to give us a milieu of sense not wholly divorced from intellect the book is so clever a book despite its faults that it deserves criticism of the admonitory rather than the objurgatory kind we should have to go far before we found such a brilliant putting into words of the famous butlerian maxim as this conscience in

clementina by a e w mason methuen co 1 clementina  is an excellent story full of the interest and excitement which keep ones attention throughout wogan the hero is a dreamy scholar as well as a man equal to several combatants at any time how he brought a bride to the old pretender and was ill rewarded for his dangerous enterprise it would not be fair to tell here enough to say that his adventures and escapes and his readiness really recall dumas for once since mr mason has an unusual gift for narrative and a rare naturalness of style more than these things though handicapped without them is the feeling for romance here exhibited the undercurrents working against the hero are lightly but skilfully suggested some sentimental readers will regret the ending but we see no adequate reason to do so mr mason is among the most promising of our younger writers and we notice his advance with pleasure   lemenlina by a av mason methuen gs a moni st the industrious novelists who ransack the theatrical wardrobes of history mr mason holds a distinct and assured position clementina leaves that position unchanged a prince in exile  a princess on her way to marry him arrested and imprisoned  a gallant irish gentleman our old friend the cosmopolitan adventurer all steel and suavity himself loving the princess yet sworn to bring her liberated to his kingthese characters wear costume to the best advantage tis fiction in fancy dress but mr mason in clementina deserves our thanks on more counts than one his prince in exile james stuart the old pretender has not yet grown quite stale in suggestion and his character is not insisted upon as an historical portrait once one knows that one is in for a story of battle murder and sudden death one is not put off by a too improbable coincidence nor deterred by one or two unnecessary mortal combats clementina is full of blood and wounds but the softer element is not wanting and the women are good in the highminded charles wogan with his trio of faithful comrades we have the inevitable reminder of dumas  and in mr masons general style we have the equally inevitable reminder of stevenson wogan says hearts cannot be commanded alas mademoiselle it ie a hard world at the end of it it is mortised with the blood of broken hearts but duty madam duty a consciousness of rectitude these are very noble qualities one feels indeed that stevenson would not have made much more of that scene in which wogan after overcoming singlehanded five armed men follows the princess to the lodge in the forest and there waiting for the dawn makes his confession t lenientina is a bustling and at times a moving story  clementina by a e w mason  the landlord the lady and mr charles wogan were all three it seemed in lucks way on that september morning of the year 1711 a romance of the jacobites somewhat after the manner of the courtship of morrice buckler the old pretender is introduced as one of the chief characters the book is illustrated by mr bernard partridge effectively methuen gs,random
in the face of the world by alan st aubyn 2 vols lnatto ana windue  alan st aubyn  has written pleasant enough novels to make a reader of one of them take up another without misgiving but i in the face of the world has changed all that it is a very depressing book after reading it we feel we have been underfed for days it is a philanthropic novel but that is not our quarrel with it philanthropists are persons of bone and blood and muscle like the worst of us and their society in or out of a novel should be as robust as other peoples but there is nothing and there is nobody robust here tristram lushington was heir to a brewery and millions and he gave them up for conscience sake the surrender had of course to include his sweetheart the highborn mary too then he joined a mission in the east end well these were all manly things to do and why was not a fine breezy story made out of them  but he was a puling creature and so were all his friends and companions and they lived in a sodden atmosphere the one spark of life comes from the gouty old brewer who once bitterly and with some reason remarked  i did not know that my son had joined a sisterhood the fact is everybody who crosses the pages save the gouty brewer occasionally is the shadow of a shadow the breath of life is not in their nostrils and in the name of all the good causes the writer has at heart we appeal to her to endeavour to make their service a less flabby affair it doesnt improve matters that tristram comes in for his fathers baronetcy a million of moneyhe had developed convenient ideas about the stewardship of wealthand mary who in the meanwhile had turned philanthropist too,random
the woman who vowed by ellison harding fisher unwin 6s the idea of this book is astonishing enough but the author has failed to make it successful his  vision of the future  reveals new york as the centre of the cult of the demetrian and other customs of the ancient greeks including their names and costumes henry t joyce who tells the story awakens to find himself confronted by a girl in greek dress she is lydia the woman who vowed and she introduces him to chairo cleon ariston and other incongruous inhabitants of the revolutionised american city lydia has decided to accept the call of demeter and naturally this scientific marriage is distasteful to chairo who is in love with her the lover eventually carries off lydia from the temple of the priests and after a few tame adventures is absolved from punishment and marries her of course the principal object of the author is to show us how collectivism and the cult of demeter would work in a world that had already tacitly accepted christianity and its rival religions he is too ambitious however for easy as it may be to repeat the copybook maxims of socialism it is quite another thing to reproduce them in a novel and make them appear real there is no genuine imagination shown in  the woman who vowedno distinction either in style or thoughtand it is not improved by the american spelling adopted throughout this may be a small point but the english reader with a reverence for the classics will scarcely approve of neaera of new york city  travelling  from one  centre  to another only a great writer could rise superior to the difficulties of this subject and ellison hardings attempt only convinces us that nature never intended greek culture to flourish in the western hemisphere  the woman wu vowed by g b burgin hutchinson  co this novel treating of the institution of a cult of demeter is intended to appeal to thoughtful men and women some of the advantages and disadvantages of the selection of specially endowed individuals and the voluntary election of the feminine among such to dispassionate motherhood are roughly indicated rather than precisely stated account is taken of the failure of selfless attempts to override natures apparently indiscriminate mating but we find no notice of some difficulties obvious to students of eugenics our author may of course hold that as society is depicted in this far future state a scientifically regulated health environment would remove some present dangers there are other solutions to problems of the day suggested but the lack of individuality in the book oppresses us,random
the enchanted garden by maud stepney rawson methuen 6s mrs rawson has the happy gift of conveying her readers as on a magic carpet to the scene of her stories and making them at home there in another book she suggested very faithfully the restfulness and oldworld charm of rye here in some four hundred pages of passionate appreciation she reflects the fascination the enchantment of a subtropical island in midatlantic the  topsyturvy alluring aggravating ramshackle spellbound island of san carlos with its almost overpowering beauty is the chosen background for the sequel to an unhappy marriage it is to the luxuriant solitude of the enchanted garden of an old spanish villa at puerto de oro that joanna hurst flies for seclusion from her husbands infidelities the novelty of the environment is the only new thing in the story which runs the usual course what follows seeming to be more of a concession to prevailing taste than the inevitable outcome of the situation the joanna of the authors imagination and interpretation might be called an idealist of the affections as we understand her she does not strike us as at all the kind of woman who being outraged and heartbroken by her husbands misconduct would fall in love again at the first opportunity however innocently and discreetly here however the authors difficulty comes inhow is a matrimonial tragedy to be contrived without the other man  in this case the other man is an estimable harmless young engineer who makes no great figure even at the moment when he is shot down by joannas husband at the door of the enchanted garden sympathetically told as it is and with considerable literary aptitude the story of joannas marriage is all too familiar it is possible to weary of even the most skilful probings and pryings into a womans soul for the reader of many novels the charm of the book lies in its pictures of life in san carlos in the warmth and colour of mrs rawsons descriptions and in her sketches of joannas fellow exiles from  la polly who rules the english community to the latest hotel bore these sketches are admirable and of far more artistic value than many joannas,random
miss bracegirdle and others by stacy aumonier hutchinson 7s 6d net mr aumonier has the gift of companionableness which makes his thinnest stories engaging not that his material is sparse or hackneyed quite the contrary most of his tales have an element of astonishment in them but when he tells you about the serene and unadventurous delights of a prewar village cricket match just pointed by postwar wistfulness you find yourself as well beguiled as by his more strange and inventive stories his funny mans day gives one an unashamed affection for the rednosed comedian where was wych street is a little triumph of social comedy and so is his octave of jealousy with its little studies of the lines of caste from the tramp to the county magnate in all these tales there is a touch of knowing tenderness which never degenerates into the sentimental whilst the assured knowledge of a wide swath of life never takes on the air of a knowingness which repels there is no aim at stylism in his fluently economical method but these stories are good reading full of the pieces of conviction touching lightly upon underlying depths and like othere in the poem he shows us the walrus tooth these thirteen tales in short from miss bracegirdle to tke brown wallet are something more than readablethey are companionable,random

the fictims of society iv the countess of blessington 3 vols saunders  otley this work not only in its general scope and tendency but in the artistic manner in which its subject is treated reminds us

northeast xv works by the countess of blessington 3 vols we read these excellent volumes through nt once eagerly though not hastily pausing over those parts that required a deeper consideration applauding much and approving of the whole though it treats of modern manners and ol the frivolous actors on a frivolous though lofty stage there is something very poetical grand and even awful in the construction of this tale in its commencement it is blithe with creations light gay and happy  the least is crowned with mirth wit sparkles and there is a sort of graceful revelry among perfumes and howers hut very early we see the serpent creeping from place to place withering everything by its trail a blight falls on these bowers of joy a wanness steals over the countenances of all and at last the drama closes in an atmosphere darkened by horrors and on a scene defiled by blood such is a general outline ol the  victims of society it is not only pathetic but eminently tragic though moral is biaoneil forth with a fearful vivid nesslike the hash of lightning felt through the closed the wilfully closed eyelids it tells distinctly to even the deafened ear of the sensuahst that indiscretion almost always leads to vice vice to crime crime most certainly to a neverfailing misery  and that each is the more difficult to retrace as it approaches the dread climax of woe that must terininate cither in despair or death hut to enter more into particulars we must tell the reader that the  victims of society are rather the vic tims of some of the errors that seem to be inseparable from it highly civilised society maybe compared to a rich soil and which if it were not rich could not produce so many goodly flowers and fruits  but this very richness will and must foster into a most rampant luxuriance all poisonbearing weeds to repress if they cannot wholly eradicate the latter is the office of the divine the legislator and the moralist society itself is not to blame if unfortunately some be thrown into contact with its henbane and its niirhtshade society strictly speaking has no victims but to the tr    vices inherent on it there are very many the whole scene of the story before us is laid in what is called high life the first and the most beautiful victim is the lady augusta vernon a radiant and loveable being and the sweetest of alf thc sacrifices when she is scarcely mon than sixteen a gay widower the karl of annandale pays her attention  bewildered by the novelty of her position and vanity filling her heart instead of love she accepts himnoel repents sin

the mystery of the boule cabinet by burton e stevenson eveleigh nash 63 the cult of mysterious crime and detective ingenuity has had so many followers of recent years that it is not easy to invent new thrills or to deceive the experienced reader throughout the story mr stevenson writes well and his criminal has dash and insolent daring  but his murdering cabinet gives up its secret to the thoughtful reader too soon while the professional jealousy and stupidity of the official detectives are too conventional to amuse us the book may serve for an idle hour  but it is not near the standard set by m leblanc,random
love in a palace by f e penny 6s chatto we confess that we always look forward to a novel by mrs f e penny with anticipations of pleasure mrs penny has managed to capture to a considerable degree the atmosphere of the east about which she writes with knowledge and insight she has the gift of the storyteller and her characters are usually real and living in  love in a palace mrs penny has produced a book which will undoubtedly please her wide circle of readers in this story of indian life she has centred the interest rather in the native characters than in the angloindians the nawab is a wonderfully wellsketched character and one follows the progress of the storyin which he plays a considerable partwith unflagging interest the comparatively few europeans who appear in the pages are of quite secondary importance though they are m no means puppets the feud between two important native families which figure in the pages of this intei esting book gives one a real insight regarding native customs and view points hassan with his oxford education is one of the most carefully drawn characters and the conflict of ideas between him and his fatherthe old mohammedan nobleman with his extraordinary and purely eastern views of women and the fate that was sure to overtake all infidelsis clearly and interestingly indicated nissa the girl who wvas going blind and with whom hassan was so deeply in love is a most charming character and readers will be glad of the unexpected denouement which mrs penny very skilfully brings about in the last few pages x e like too mrs barstow who wvas usually far more discreet than are most of the memsahibs who have been depicted in novels love in a palace may be thoroughly recommended to those who can enjoy a fresh and wellwritten story and to whom india appeals as a land of mystery and of charm,random
  money magic by hamlin garland harper  brothers the eight illustrations are merely commonplace but the story told here is well worth reading the scene is western colorado familiar ground for mr garlandand briefly the conception is that of a marriage between a hardened gambler of something over forty and a young girl in her teens who is led to entertain her suitors offer by reason of his fortune and her mothers poverty and to marry him by reason of an accident which brings him helpless and almost speechless to what is thought to be his deathbed the tough westerner recovers  and then we are brought face to face with the problem that makes che book the magic of the gamblers wealth develops the unformed untaught prairie girl into ripe and widely appreciative womanhood while endowing her with notable charms in the eyes of men more nearly her own age than the broken desperado to whom she is bound by law and honour as well as gratitude at the same time it unfits her for the companionship of rough looselived men by some the story may be thought a trifle too long but it is good stirring narrative throughout and the development of character through incident and emotional crises is highly interesting,random
i princess flower hat by mabel osgood wrvight mac millan and co 6s stories of life in the american countryside have been many of late years and they possess a peculiar charm of their own for english readers the author of this idyll who is known to some of us as the barbara of that delightful book  the open window takes a very high place among those who tell of the simpler life she makes interesting the least happenings of the farm and homestead to her the garden the neighbours the servants are full of charming suggestion with her as guide the reader feels the worries of the strenuous town fall into the background and begins to have dreams of emigrating to one of these oldworld townships set in the new world evidently there are plenty of people in the  states  who have other ideals than the pursuit of dollars the  princess  of this dainty little story is a young woman who is smitten with a sudden desire to  housekeep  on her own account she takes a cottage and her troubles with the garden with a pair of lovers with a scandalloving neighbour form the theme of the story as related by  barbara who lives near by and is a kind of guardian angel to state thus barely the central idea of the story is hardly to do it justice but we cannot spare room for quotations and indeed quotations would have to be of an inordinate length if the atmosphere of the delicate plot were to be adequately rendered we can only say that for a quiet hour or two by a fireside this little book is an ideal companion its humour is tender its pathos is not mawkish and its sentiment is altogether charming,random
novel notes donna tlresa by frances mary peard 6s macmillan there is excellent work in miss peards new book work that is vigorous crisp and enjoyable her central character donna teresa is well conceived well carried out and interesting withal moreover we like her though we regard htr forcing on ot sylvias marriage with wilbraham in a much more serious light than does miss peard we will not say it was an ingenious way of getting a fool of a sister off her hands but every time she covered or slurred over sylvias foolishness before her lover she juggled with her conscience in a parlous fashion perhaps sylvias stupidity is exaggerated she appears just on the border line of idiocy and if that were so even to allow wilbraham without remonstrance to propose to her was a crime wilbraham was a stiff prig but a prig with a rather important future would such an imbecile have been capable of the insight and the heroism of the end  some may doubt by intensifying the idiocy of the amiable sylvia miss peard has shaken several portions of her story yet we do not take back our praise for the vigorous sketches of life the clearcut portraits and the general ability of  donna teresa the roman background is effective and our only regret with regard to any of the minor characters is that we see so little of the irreconcilable cesare  donna teresa by frances mary peard donna teresa is the young english widow of an italian nobleman we are here concerned with her later loving and with that of her sister sylvia the story is a tragedy and is laid in rome which in mrs peard s experienced hands yields attractive backgrounds macmillan 6s  bonna teresa new novels by f m peard mac millan  co miss peard is one of the few modern authors who can without being dull write for the young girl and for those readers who shrink from too violent an appeal to the imagination she unfailingly reaches a certain degree of excellence in her worklimited decidedly but none the less excellenceand her new novel is no exception to this rule donna teresa is a natural impulsive young person full of generous if mistaken aspirations after the good of others and bound in consequence to burn her own and everybody elses fingers from purely altruistic motives she exerts herself and temporarily succeeds in converting her excessively uninteresting but pretty sister into the heroine of a romance with a man who thrown perpetually in their joint society must inevitably end in subjugation to her own brilliant personality the situation is worked out with considerable skill all the characters are good but perhaps the author has never done a better piece of work than the study of sylvia brodrick a petty complacent yet withal pathetic nonentity the denoament is not so good it requires a stronger hand than miss peards to deal with the sensational incident that she introduces and the end is distinctly unsatisfactory none the less the story is most wholesome and pleasant reading and full of good common sense while the boman and later the sicilian setting provides a very picturesque element,random
carlyons year by the author of lost sir massingberd c 2 vols bradbury evans co we should be guilty of exaggeration if we pronounced  carlyons year to be a very striking novel but it is a good and readable story and not unworthy of the author of  lost sir massingberd the danger incident to the rapid rising of the tide in some of our northern bays is skilfully turned to account at the beginning of the narrative and the escape of the heroine and her cousin from apparently certain destruction is powerfully told moreover the expedient is ingenious and however unexpected appears probable enough to general readers among whom quoad hoc we must include ourselves for the nonce whether such a rescue by such means is actually possible we must leave the frequenters of morecambe bay and similar inlets to determine in the sequel the story sometimes flags but it is rather interesting than dull upon the whole the flashes of humour developed in the characters of mrs newman and one or two gentlemen of the medical profession are sufficient to give some relief to what would otherwise be a picture of somewhat sombre tints the author is by no means perfect in the measurement of language and the characters occasionally take too high or too low a tone for their own consistency or for the occasion which calls forth their powers of expression akin to this defect is the absurdity of making the proud and reserved carlyon place his hand on his butlers shoulder there must be some carelessness in this for the language flows naturally enough sometimes and the author occasionally displays no slight knowledge of human nature mrs newmans feelings on the sudden death of her son seem to us to be true to nature and exceedingly well partly because very briefly described it is easy enough to write a whole prosy volume about the feelings of a bereaved parent or lover but it requires some skill to give one or two sharply defined ideas in a couple of pages the author of  carlyons year is not without i ability and although we find little to blame in the present novel we may fairly hope to find more to praise in some future effort,random

fiction the fascinating chauffeur a rolling stone by b m croker f v white and co 6s sylvias chauffeur by louis tracy illustrated ward lock and co 6s there are few presentday novels that cannot boast a chauffeur and an automobile for the daring motorist has been rapidly supplanting older types of hero in popular favour though the advent of the more venturesome airman bids fair in no short time to deprive him in his turn of his pride of place in the two novels before us the leather suit the holland coat and the goggles occupy a prominent position for mrs b ml croker and mr louis tracy have each chosen a chauffeur or rather a handsome young aristocrat more or less masquerading as such for hero these two scions of ancient houses have many points in common and there is a  strange coincidence  in the adventures that befall them a rolling stone is owen st john willoughby fitzgibbon a wild harumscarum young fellow nephew and heir to sir richard wynyard of wynyard bart a county magnate of ancient lineage and considerable wealth having sown his wild oats  not wisely but too well young owen is cast adrift by his irate uncle for a period of two years during which time he must maintain himself honourably by working for his living and earning his daily bread he is quite at a loss what to do with himself but fortunately lie has a sister lady kesters who besides being the happy possessor of a  smart new rollsroyce can also boast a  clever and contriving mind on her advice the nonplussed young prodigal becomes chauffeur to two maiden ladies who have just been cheated into acquiring a fakedup ramshackle old motor  lined with real morocco leather  and newly painted dark green the misses parrett have a niece aurea morven and after the way of the chauffeur of fiction owen at once falls desperately in love with her and though he feels that his passion is reciprocated he is debarred from declaring himself until his period of probation is over nevertheless pleasant interludes like the following when the crazy motor came to grief at a time of flood helped to make his trial less unbearablelittle little did aurea guess that as she leaned her head upon his leather shoulder how owen the chauffeur had to fight with a frantic almost overmastering desire to kiss her    fortunately with a superhuman effort he pulled himself together steadied his racing pulses and thrust the dreadful idea behind him eventually after  a few cuts and bruises a slight concussion and a broken collarbone the result of the inevitable accident owen was received back into sir richards good graces and then aurea  wondered was any girl in all the wide world as happy as herself  for you see she had married her aunts chauffeur in the course of her pleasantly conceived interesting and wholesome story mrs croker displays her intimate acquaintance with things rural as witness mrs hogbens postmorter reminiscence of her last pet pig  well of course he grew fat and ready for the butcher and when he was prime he had to gobut it just broke my heart so it did for nights before i couldnt sleep for crying here she became lachrymose but it had to be and me bound to be about when the men came and the cries and yells of him drove me wild though of course once he was scalded and hung up and a fine weight it wor a nice thing to have ones own pork and bacon  sylvias chauffeur is also a fitz if you please  george augustus fitzroy viscount medenham son and heir to the earl of fairholme he takes the place of a real chauffeur whose car has broken down on derby day and in his stead drives a charming and wealthy american girl sylvia vanrenen and her chaperon from the savoy hotel to epsom downs fitzroy whose family motto is  i dare all drives a purring mercury which sang the song of the free highway and sped through the leafy lanes of surrey with a fine disregard for acts of parliament and the rules and regulations therein made and provided after the derby the noble viscount drives the ladies on a tour through the south and west of england and mr tracy gives a fine picture of a run through the cheddar gorge on to the bleak and desolate tableland of the miendips though some of his descriptive writing savours rather of the guidebook at symonds yat sylvia goes for a moonlight row on the wye with her aristocratic chauffeur the boat fouls something and a whole seam is torn open followed by an inrush of water whereupon fitzroy leaps overboard and carries sylvia to dry landon his shoulder much in the same way that owencarried aureaher hair brushed his forehead his eyes his lips as he lifted her down his hands rested for an instant on the warmu softness of her neck and shoulders his heart leapt in a mad riot of joy at the belief that she would have uttered no protest if he had drawn her nearer instead of setting her decorously on her feet he next fights a duel with a french count who has designs on sylvia and her fortune and receives a sword thrust  in

the queens shilling ta quemes aiiny a soldiers story by captain arthur griffiths in two volumes henry s king and co we ae very much mistaken if the two novelists dear above all others to military menlever and thackeraywe not especially dear to captain griffiths we should say that at some distinct period of his life he has been under the sway of each of these magicians and that their potent wands still exercise a joint spell over him at all events in  the queens shilling  he has produced something that serves to remind us of both these old masters if their mantles have not in some fragmentary shape fallen upon him he has at least contrived to echo their tones in an uncommonly genuine fashion at the same time no one must expect to find in captain griffiths a second lever or thackeray the inspiration or imitation whichever it be is not a replica in any sense of the word in no respect is the story copied from any other and there is in it individuality enough to give its author a distinct place among novelists which if it does not bring him anywhere near the first class as certainly raises him head and shoulders above the herd the novel is called  a soldiers story   and inasmuch as the narrative portions are written with a good deal of humour and life and are seldom even for half a page wanting in interest it reminds us of charles lever and inasmuch as one or two of the characters the hero and dr starkie among the number are such as thackeray might have sketched out we are reminded involuntarily of that inimitable pen that knowing all classes and grades knew perhaps soldiers best coming however as we do in the eighth chapter suddenly and most unexpectedly on the mystery captain griffiths has thought good to trail before us we experience a feeling of revulsion at the unwelcome apparition and earnestly regret that anything of the sort is allowed to interfere with a really good story the plot becomes very soon transparent as the noonday and so entirely commonplace that we believe the interest of the tale would be actually heightened by its removal whilst all that was worth saving would remain hiding in a curtained balcony the hero at the early age of sixteen overhears a passage of arms between lady moynehan and a footman in which the lady comes off second best the menial being as usual in possession of a secret the secret pertains to lady moynehans niece with whom it is clearly the heros intention to fall in love it is produced with a flourish on several favourable opportunities and always procures the desired effect in the end the secret turns out to be not so bad as it might be the wicked get more or less trampled upon and the proper people marry each other but looking at  the queens shilling as we prefer to do apart from its plot it is easy to find in it not a few really admirable pointy the author has now and then indulged a weakness for smart things to a damaging extent and he bas certainly overweighted his vessel with personal lumber in the shape of one or two characters who appear about twice and then disappear for ever though we are constantly expecting them to turn up again he might with advantage have avoided both these faults and perhaps will do so on a future occasion in the following incident for instance captain griffithss straining after conversational smartness has produced a very miserable result hero and heroine are playing croquet together   what a nice game this i89s he said with enthusiasm heroine however snubs him  it is a horribly stupid game i think i wonder why people are so mad about it time was when at such a reply alured would have shut up like a limpet but he was a man now hero then proceeds to vindicate his manhood in the following refined manner  he put up his hand quickly to his nose and felt for his handkerchief whatever is the matter mr frere inquired millicent quite hurriedly i was only feeling if my nose was off  off   yes bitten off by me f how absurd you are she cried bursting into a merry laugh the scenery of the story is all very graphically presented there is a freshness about the life at the rgmental dep6t in the crimea at aldershot and in new zealand that convinces us of its reality this leads us to i conclude that captain griffiths was warranted in giving his hero a commission at the early age of sixteen and in making him adjutant of his regiment at twentythree during the crimean war boyensigns were gazetted week by week but not many we should suppose only sixteen years and a few months old there is moreover no reason for thus transgressing what appear to us to be the bounds of probability unless captain griffiths thinks it absolutely indispensable to send his hero out as a newspaper correspondent to the francogerman war and is of opinion that no one ought to marry when he is more than thirtysix he would have lone well to have sacrificed either his francogerman war or his theory of marriage we conclude this notice with an admirable little passage worthy of thackeray alured aged sixteen is brought to town by his father the major to cram for sandhurst a hat you must have at once says the major peremptorily before we do anything else i hate hatsl nonsense alured you cant wear anything else in london then i hate london  presently father and son meet a club man a friend of the major  his coatthese were the days

the hopeful journey by beatrice kea seymour chapman and hall 7s 6d mrs seymours third book is a coolheaded study of feminism by a writer unbiassed enough to see the objective and subjective cons to the advance of woman into public life since the victorian era her method brings three generations through her pages judith the thwarted whose sexlife blotted out all else eve her daughter who came near to achieving her worklife and fitted her motherhood and wifehood in and monica who brings the wheel full circle by deliberately choosing to sacrifice herself on behalf of her emotions and for a husband who is none too admirable other women and their men move through these pages skilfully evidencing the variations on the theme of sexlife versus worklife and the writer has given her book value by the truth alike of their characterisation and oi the historical background the weakness of the method is that it does not make for a strong story and tends to catalogue those ordinarily extraordinary eventsbirth marriage and deathin the terms of their own terrible regularity but the fact that they are presented from a womans viewpoint in relation to an important phase of historical development is mrs seymours success,random

the apple of eden by e temple thurston 6s chapman and hall the problem which amr thurston has set himself is the celibacy of the priesthood and he has grappled with it earnestly courageously and with a measure of success it is his very earnestness that has prevented him from attaining a greater success the problem is obtruded in season and out of season and the entire machinery of the story iv contructed only with the purpose of exhibiting it with teatrical effectivene thu bok in short is quite inonclusive and unatisfactory as an an ewer to the question raises and its cleverness is not of the study but of the rage the two central figures the neurotic priest and the eurotic woman do not enlist svmpathv while the manner f their meeting makes a heavy demand on the power of oincidence it is imperative to sav that mr thurston hareated a none too pleasing subject with great delicacy in n irish novel we naturally expect at least a gleam of humour ut we look for this in vain there are many crude things ai the story which seem to mark it as a first attempt but its fects are not withott qualities of promise in his next ook we trust that mr thurston will refrain from tearing neurosis to tatters that he will abjure the popian herehat life is all a single  ruling passion and that he will ut aside all thoughts of the curtain the footlight and the 1 idden orchetra  fiction the apple of eden by e temple thurston chapman  hall os this is the story of a great temptation of a mans struggle with it and of his ultimate victory  the man is an irish catholic priest and his struggle is to keep the vow of celibacy he made without understanding what it means he has grown to adolescence first in a remote farmhouse and then in a seminary and when he is a man in years he knows as little of the world as a child the book opera with a scene in the village confessional the priest hears a young mans story of seduction and he counsels the penitent either to marry the girl or never to see her again it is on father michaels agitation as the young man speaks of the girls beauty that the readers attention is fixed for the priest is a student waking suddenly in fear and trembling to the facts of life mr thurston writes of these facts with a plainness that will give offence to some to those who think a novel should not deal with questions of sex because it necessarily reaches minds unfit for such discussions and also to those catholics who will shrink from the picture of a priest disloyal to his vows yet the apple of eden leaves a stronger impression of spiritual charm than of physical coarseness and the author succeedsas the author of that great novel  ekkehardt succeededin invoking your sympathy with the priest both in his struggle with temptation and in his horrorstricken repentance if you are a protestant you may read a novel that makes a great todo about a monk and feel at the end of it that any woman might have married him as cheerfully as if he had been a solicitor but then the author has failed in the main purpose of his story which was to rouse in all his readers some understanding of the tremendous issues involved for the man concerned some sympathy with the commotion raised in his soul some belief beyond all differences of creed in the binding force on mankind of solemn vows mr thurston has not failed and this is due partly to his fine portrait of the erring priest but also to his companion portrait of father connelly the curates superior and friend and the most delightful character in the story his breezy kindly commonsense appreciates the younger mans subtler nature forgives him his sins and helps him to save himself at the end the two priests are the book the other characters are subsidiary for a long time even roona the girl with whom father michael falls so passionately in love only comes in like a shadow why did mr thurston blot her past with an unconvincing story of seduction she is the girl of whom the young man spoke in the first chapter after a long delay she becomes his unwilling wife and soon after her marriage she is ready to leave her husband for a priest of her church it is father michael who ordains that he and she shall part but in the scenes where she meets and learns to love him she never for a moment behaves like a girl with a questionable history and we do not believe that she had one we should like to know who took her to the theatre and walked with her in regent street if it was her future husband it is odd that father michael who recognises his former penitent in a later chapter did not recognise him then the pictures of irish country life are drawn with knowledge and are interesting but the triumph of the book is father connelly  the apple cf eden by e temple thurston il  chapman  hall the novel with a purpose always stands in danger of being wrecked by its purpose it is very difficult to subordinate the moral design to the canons of art and this is particularly difficult when the writer is a beginner without a proper knowledge of the rules and limitations of his art yet on the whole mr thurstons book comes out of the ordeal fairly well his novel is a diatribe against celibacy in the priesthood and he has selected a theme which gives his case the utmost strength it could have in other words he tests his conclusions by extremes it is obvious that all roman catholic priests are not in the position in which the rev father everett found himself but it is equally obvious that the case may have occurred mr thurstons opinion seems to be that a young man of the age at which priests are ordained is not in a position to judge of his ability to renounce certain passions but he probably makes the mistake of letting father everett develop his error too quickly the priest only escapes finally because to him  the sacrament of matrimony was ordained by god the vow of celibacy was ordained by man it seems then that had not the sacrament stood in the way he would have fallen from his vows and that appears to be what mr thurston would justify such questions are naturally not for consideration here  but we may say that in working out his problem the author reveals large powers of intuition and realization he is also skilful in his delineation of a woman and in rendering irish life when he drops his problems he will probably write a very good novel,random
new novelsl the drum8 of war by henry de vere stacpoole john murray we must regard mr stacpoole at this stage as in the forefront of romantic writers it is not certain that in sheer romance he does not beat his rivals his power over an atmosphere is as remarkable as his facility he wanders from epoch to epoch and from country to country his new novel is concerned with the france of the third empire we have an incidental glimpse very vivid of the disastrous policy which culminated in the fatuous and frenzied cries of a berlin but for the most part the story is divorced from history it has at its base a tradition that the persons of an ancient tragedy are reproduced in hero and heroine and fulfil their allotted fate  heroine  is perhaps the wrong word to use as it is probable that the author as well as his readers would claim as heroine another woman than margaret von lichtenberg candidly the career of this other does not convince us altogether she is too sentimentalized it was unnecessary for mr stacpoole to drag her through the mire why did he  this wantonness is the only blot on an enthralling romance,random
finchs fortune by mazo de la roche 7s 6d macmillan this book forms the third volume of the chronicles of the whiteoak family a saga that i already has attracted favourable notice for its brilliant picture of canadian life the whiteoaks three or four generations of them lived together in patriarchal manner and it was not surprising that now and again a rebel appeared and that a whiteoak bride sometimes found the environment trying the present story deals with finch whiteoak who was left a fortune by his grandmother to the annoyance of his numerous relations finch was something of a sport in the family and he had to undergo a variety of emotional experiences before he found himself and his art it is a spacious novel written on broad lines and with a wealth of admirable characterisation we are introduced to unusual and attractive people faithfully and humorously drawn and we are left with a desire to pursue further the history of the family as the story ends with a birth there seems every reason why the desire may be gratified,random
literature the writings of john greenleaf whittier 7 vols macmillan  co this edition of the works of mr whittier is intended at least as to the poems to be complete unless so far as there are hopes that the time  honoured author whose  brown dwarf of eugen  and  one of the signers date only from last year may add some postscripts of pleasant verse to the collection which now contains he says  all that i care to republish and some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself i should have omitted at the request of his publishers mr whittier has in this edition allowed the reappearance though only in an appendix of early poems which for many years he has banished as not worthy of his nameand as to which indeed it is not possible to say that his name will restore them to the favour with which they were received by american readers of sixty years ago when as he apologetically remarks  the standard of criticism was not discouragingly high the publishers object in persuading mr whittier to republish the things that he would rather not have written was  to make the edition so complete and retrospective that students of the poets career will always find the most abundant materials for their purpose and if we are to suppose that mr whittiers readers read not for the sake of his poetry but to give themselves a course of educational study on his career as a poet the appendix may certainly be useful to them tor the excess of juvenile efflorescence and the protraction of its period in mr whittiers case as contrasted with the fact of his nevertheless coming to a fruitage time are shown by the poems in this appendix and their dates to be exceptional and though the phenomenon is easily explainable by the cause mr whittier assigns for the popularity of his verse in its turgid immaturity it offers something for the student of the career to study if he will take the trouble to compare with mr whittiers literary infancy the literary infancies of other writers who earlier or as late as he like him eventually arrived at literary years of discretion but even from this point of view it is difficult to see any sufficient advantage gained to the world by overruling mr whittiers wisely critical judgement of his least meritorious productions the arrangement has however given him the opportunity of dismissing the tedious and unreal attempt in the school of scott  mogg megone which disfigured his former collected editions to the limbo of the appendix and thus increasing the honour to which his riper work entitles him from all critics who appreciate artistic unaffectedness and the grace of sobriety the poems of mr whittiers literary prime vary much in quality but all have at least the strength of manly common sense good taste and direct expression while many possess also either reticent and therefore effective pathos or a certain eager and orderly rush rather perhaps of orator than of poet but instinct with metrical vigour which has characterised some of his most popular pieces his boundaries have not been wide but within them he has been master he has been sure of his purpose and what he purposed he could effect and he has shown an understanding of his limits which is in itself a faculty of no mean order in england his poetry taking it all in all has not met with the wide and somewhat undiscriminating acceptance it has received from his own countrymen and only a few pieces can be named as having become favourites of our general public but we may fairly say that the restriction of the welcome on this side the water is quite as undiscriminating as its liberality on the other side for instance now that every one knows  maud muller why are there comparatively few who are familiar with  telling the bees  an idyl so tenderly and touchingly simple that we mean presently to quote it in fullwith  st martins summer with  mabel martin with  the new wife and the old  the suitability of  barbara frietchie and  skipper

tattered field  this is a fine piece of passionate rhetoric and has real fire in it still mr whittiers antislavery poems do not show him at his best as a poet indeed nobodys antislavery poems ever have been truly poems though some rare few have like  the pine  tree been very good metrical speeches the theme would seem on first thoughts just what must have made any man whose heart was hot about it and who could put feelings into verse at all capable of true poetry for that if for nothing else and must have inspired any true poet with dramatic force and lyric passion to make his least words on it immortal but second thoughts explain why the fact has been so much the reverse antislavery was not a theme for a poet it was too abstract too political and above all too argumentative a great poet might with one short drama one lyric one stanza nay one line about some slave who never existed but in his mind and his readers minds have found his way to human hearts then and for all hereafter as long as the english language lasts but there were in the antislavery agitation no poets who could or would write their poems on the slaves side so the antislavery poets were absorbed in the great public question with all its disputatious details they were in the thick of debates and arguments they wrote them with thought of their opponentsto answer to persuade or to attack poems so written may have their influence in a great public controversy but the controversy over their life is gone they are like weapons of an ancient warfareweapons we respect in the museums but that have no purpose in them for our days mrs beecher stowe in her own line of art managed better she used sympathies of human nature that belonged to all times and peoples and produced a novel which was genuinely a novel with the novels power to absorb attention to amuse and to move and which whatever its faults has lost nothing of that power by reason of the slavery question having become obsolete to her the theme does seem to have given inspiration beyond her normal faculty so that this one book of hers her worst as to some glaring bad qualities has in it a something amounting to genius which her other works can by no means parallel her imagination seems to have been aroused by her zeal while the zeal of the poets whirled their imaginations away and left it the only difference between their polemical productions and those of other able rhetoricians that theirs were in verse and had more similes in them much the same has always been the case with poets polemics weean call to mind no verse directly dealing with aay question agitating the public mind catting for any wrong to be righted urging any great measure which has had it in it to aurvive as poetry the success of its cause except mrs brownings  song of the children and that the  song of the children though intended polemically not only had aa influence on the public mind at the time bat stands forth a poem is because mrs browning with the high poets sympathetic instinct went at once forth from herself aad let her pleadings and her reasonings pass into the piteous simplicity of the thoughts and words of the childrenjust as she would have done in fact had their miseries belonged to ancient history or to an imaginary world to take mr whittier at his best as distinctively a poet we must go to his  poems of nature poems subjective and reminiscent and  narrative and legendary poems as is inevitable when a writer tries to classify his collected poems the series overlap and a piece that stands in one series might as fitly or more fitly stand in another  and it is the merit of the beet poems in these three series that they might all lay claim from one point of view or another to belong to the poems of nature  telling the bees  in the  narrative and legendary poems owes its charm to this and its tender implication and tu4 narration of the simple love and simple sorrow here is the place  right over the hill buna the path i took  vou can see the gap in the old wall still and the steppingstones in the shallow brook there is the house with the gate redbarred and the poplars tall and though barns brown

taylor the free cosmopolite declining to accept these oems the wreck of rivermouth the taids of attitash  kallundborg church  the worship of nature and suchas personal and occasional we confine our remarks to the pieces that rightfully belong to these headings when we say that this kind of verse is not so favourably appreciated in england as it appears to be iu the united states possibly all our poets too in their private life write verse to each other but if so they except in one or two exceptional instances do not publish it and they are not often called on for odes and hymns at  celebrations  and openings and anniversariesand so much the better the critic always feels regret when he finds the abilities of men with real gifts frittered away upon these politenesses of the prose there is no need to say much it does not compel blame it does not invite praise margaret smiths journal the editor tells his readers presents a tolerably lifelike picture of the past  unfortunately it does not the shorter tales also show that mr whittier has not that gift of vividness of making even transparent unreality seem true till the moment the reader leaves off reading which is specially the novelists the papers in the two other volumes are on  the conflict with slavery on politics and reforms on literary and historic subjects or are brief biographies of men and of books and tributes to contemporariesall of them manifestly contributions to periodical literature they have of course spirit and purpose we marked from one paper only at least a dozen passages quite amazing for inflation mixed metaphor and bad taste passing to another paper we found not one florid sentence the prose works are not dated but the difference in style must be a matter of dates and it may be reasonably inferred that the florid papers belong to the immature period and the better ones be taken as the true standard of mr whittiers prose,random
martin pole new novels by john saunders 2 vols tinsley brothermartin pole is the son of a proud madame pole who once waa hardhearted to the poor and refused to relieve an old gypsy wife who c urned her and declared that her son should die on his twentyfirst birthday and that on that day she herself would come and see the working of the curse adding with devilish refinement it may not be till the last hour but look for me then it may not be till the last second of the striking of the clock but even then look for me the proud lady is fairly frightened to death though nobody knows what is the matter with her on her deathbed she confides her secret to an old retainer entreating him to watch over her son especially otbe day of doom the poor boy has been ag wiiiii led listener and the knowledge of this curse acting on a nervous fragile body nearly works its own fulfilment a wicked halfbrother who would inherit the property after him aggravates the fear produced by the prophecy as much m possible and works on his brother martins imagination to such an extent that on his twentyfirst birthday he nearly dies of fright but old mathew the faithful servant sets himself to circumvent him and in order to carry his master through the dreaded day he induces different persons to come and tell him stories or to read manuscripts  these tales are set in the foregoing framework in the end old matthew succeeds in unmasking the wicked machinations of the halfbrother and rouses all the energy latent in the poor doomed youth to shake off his superstition and by the confession of a gypsy woman the very pitiful nature of the beldame who uttered the curse is made manifest the book ends with the bellringing and rejoicing proper when an heir comes of age this framework is as the reader may see somewhat nonsensical but the tales are told with a fervour and eloquence which carry the reader along the different stories vary in interest  the best tale though it is extravagant is called  the haunted crust  to christina  is also good but there is an overstrained attempt at rhetoric which disfigures the authors style he would gain by simplicity  m1artin pole surely the socalled sensation novel has had its dav a novel ought to bring us something new to us living in londuo to whom the daily paper offers such an abundance of real hlorrors actually perpetrated within somne few miles of our own doors it is a grievance when we take up a new book for a chance of inding some more refreshing subject of thought and then just when we begin to get interested in the characters to find them either conmmitting at crime or havina committed a crime or going to commit one after all crime is the exception not the rule of life it is a relief to feel that even with the greatest rascals of our acquaintance ninetynine hundredths of their actions are not criminal at any rate when we take up a novel it should be in the hope of forgetting the ghastlier scenes of life and that we may for an hour be amused not that we would banish all tragic circumstances from a noveland the deepest tragedy is connected with crimebut let it bear a moderate relation to the lighter and more pleasing phases of life and character we are led to these reflections by the impression which  martin pole has made upon us the book consists of a series of tales supposed to be related by an old gardener named matthew micklethrift three of these tales were written by miss saunders and one of them named  old miatthews puzzle she wrote at the age of sixteen the other tales are the productions of mr saunders her father who wrote them many years ago the construction of the story is this the old gardener introduces us to martin poles mother who has married a second husband a squire pole a man of sixtyfive after having one child by her first marriage james hilman matthew describes mrs pole as a proud unbending woman with a sweeping walk with blue eyes with piles of flaxen curls and with a habit of staring straight at people without seeming to see them she had never spoken to matthew until he had lived there five years when he rescued her from the importunities of a troublesome gypsy woman after this a child was born who is martin pole halfbrother to james hilman martin is pale and sickly and to most people seems not engaging but old matthew likes him the best of the two there is a fatal shadow over his home there is something wrong with his mother for when mistress pole sits at work with martin beside her she often clenches her hands and her lips turn white she has screaming fits too and seems altogether a very unfit companion for poor little weakly martin who is morbidly fascinated by her strange behaviour at sixteen martin who has been sent to school comes home ill the squire is dead and the mother and son live together for some time no wonder that he continues ailing even four years of college life do not shake off the effects of his gloomy life at home then comes the miothers deathbed scene and a secret connected with her history but for this as it is a secret our readers may be referred to the book the different stories which follow are told to martin for a purpose connected with that secret we will only intimate that the great object to be obtained is to draw martins mind away from a particular train of though at a particular time the first tale is read out to martin by james hilman it is called  the plague stone of aberford we could almost fancy that the sun insurance office officials must have been reading this tale over night and in a dream resulting from it mistaken mr wolley for mr chorley the father of constance there were however in mr chorleys house large rolls of paper dry peasticks firewood and candles all placed in most suspicious array and the house mysteriously took fire in a manner not easily accounted for and there is moreover no comparison between the poor little place in which constance and her father lived and the campden house mansion filled with all the wonders of art collected by mr wolley and in the case of constances father unlike that of mr trolley there was everything to gain by an act of incendiarism mr chorley however though guilty plays his part so craftily that he is d thanked in the name of the office for his courageous admirable conduct as he turns away when thanked to hide his feelings he meets the glance of his little daughter constance  mournful and stern as e eye of an accusing angel soon after this constance who is but a child in martin pole by john saundes author of 6 abel drakes wife c in twr volume tinsley brothers ears sets forth into the world with her little brother whom she had rescued froin the fire she refuses to live with her father or to let her brother remain with hinm wel shall not follow her in her wanderings there are several passages of great tenderness and touiching beauty especially in her story with kits friends and in the lovepassages between kit and constance but our judgement revolts against the impossible union of a childs weaknless with the strength of a womans nature it needs all the touches of affection and happiness between kit and his grandfhther and eppie to relieve the dreariness of that part of the story which relates to marimadukes mniserable falling away and his dieath after all constances sacritices to save him we must however remember that this is a story which james hilman whose interest it is lot to cheer martin chooses to read to him as it is old matthews turn next we might expect a cheerful story to succeed for he knows the importance of bringrilna cheerfulness to the patients aid we are therefore surprised and disappointed to find that wvhen told to begin old matthew says begin  lord bless me sir if it doesnt set ones flesh creeping to go hunting up the dead out of the churchyard yonder then follows  old matthews puzzle in which we have a shipwreck in the fifth palge  and the lamentable experience of one of the women named i martha prew who getting more thin and white and scaredlooking every day still lives on and on in spite of a pack of sorrows she has at son whose bringint up troubles her greatly and about whom there is evidently a secret very unpleasant people in everyday life are those people with secrets this however is the first piece of the  puzle the next two are a workshop and a pretty young woman a niece of marthas old matthew says that although she was reckoned pretty  she was too much like a cat for hit we should conceive of her as more like a serpent she is at any rate by no means an agreeable i object of contemplation her low straight forehead was so white iou could see the blue veins but when she was upset those veins would work to a dark purple we shall not follow this story suffice it to say that its interest is entirely of the  sensational character the winding up of it is so horrible that we can but hope that miss saunders will henceforth turn her imaginative powers to a more agreeable use the  curates story is the most cheerful in the book there is neither murder arson nor suicide in it only a very pleasant frank kindly girl a father worthy of such a daughter and a curate who must be everything that is desirable for margaret loves himi devotedly  jerry and his haunted crust which is by miss saunders is decidedly more pleasing than  the puzzle we do not however quite like the prayers in ungrammatical language of course we know that illiterate folk must even pray as well as talk in bad grammar but it would be better to leave that to be understood we have yet  good deal of sensational work to go through in the windinrgup chapter but it is a comfort to know that after all these dismal stories the listening patient is cured a time comles when he walks abroad and  the stones echo under martin poles firm tread we can scarcely fancy indeed that he could have been so very quickly restored to strength it should have taken much time and much quinine to brine him round after all that he had had to go through on the whole we do not think this book is likely to add to mir saunderss reputation as for his own share in its contents he might have done more wisely in not giving his juvenile writings to the public in an artists studio there hangs many an unfinished or selfcondemned sketch over whiclh mlanyprecious hours have been spent  not wasted but spent with a profitable resultin greater skill and clearer insight for the working out of the pictures from which the artists fame may at lest accrue but when once he

the houme of defence x ua    by e f benson i klimnemann mr bensons new novel is frankly a treatise on christian science we gather from the introduction that the author does not belong to the sect and that he does not accept its principles but he believes that the  christian scientists  have got hold of part of a truth his method of dealing with them is sym pathetic but dispassionate and he claims to have witnessed some cures by them among other things mr benson claims in his dedication to have seen a man drink enough laudanum to kill him in order to cure a victim of the habit he says the demonstration succeeded though it is not clear why and the poison had no effect on the heroic drinker this being a work of fiction we are not called upon to express any opinion regarding this statement yet mr bensons plot is so woven of christian science that it is exceedingly difficult to criticise his story away from it its main theme is the cure of a morphinomaniac and his restoration to sound life we are more used to characters such as lady thurso in his books they are amusing but somewhat monotonous being cut to a pattern mr benson being an expert story  teller always manages to take his reader along with him probably the book will be debated owing to its theme and it may even have some proselytising effect  the house of defence fiction by e f benson heinemann 6s we wish the author of  dodo  would forget that he is the son of an archbishop and not try to be serious he has a very pleasant little gift of nonsense and good nonsense is rare in this world of puritans and parish councillors there is a dash of it in the book before us  charming lady thurso talks nonsense before she becomes involved with a layfigure of a foreign nobleman  so does lady maud raynham before she becomes involved with the  christian science hero bertie cochrane while the character and conversation of alice yardly a specimen of  christian scientists  at their flabbiest are good nonsense all through if mr benson had kept the christian science at its flabbiest we should have had an amusing book  he has chosen to try and show it at its firmest and is so busy fighting against the suggestion that his christian science hero is a prig that he has no leisure to make him a man and all to no purpose so far as the art of fiction is concerned does he treat the subject in deadly earnest the story is not exciting and only rarely amusing the characters are not alive the whole effect is of a story concocted with but moderate skill to lead up to a great scene and the great scene when it comes is not convincing mr benson says he saw it with his own eyesthe characters of course being different he saw a christian scientist cure a victim of the laudanum habit by drinking a large dose of the poison without suffering the least harm from it and bertie cochrane after all the doctors have failed to break thurso of the habit finally breaks him of it in that manner but how  by christian science  or by the mere shockoften a wonderfully efficacious thing in mental cases that is just the question it remains unanswered and so we miss both a good novel and a convincing exposition of the powers of christian science when mr benson tries to be earnest he merely succeeds in being respectable he means well,random
tales of the wild the way of the strong by ridgwell cullum chapman  hall 6s this book opens amid one of those wild and desolate scenes which mr cullum well knows how to impress on the readers imagination it is the desert heart of the yukon in winter  the great whit1 land broken and torn  and silent a woman and the man she loves are facing the perils of the winter trail trying to reach civilization in time for her child to be born without shame later we have equally striking descriptions of wide cornfields in the heart of canada and it is here the millionaires luxurious home is set the  strong man  is primaeval and rough in character unscrupulous and free in his vengeance as in his generosity at first the greed of gain entirely possesses him  later in life his love for a woman absorbs him as completely the plot though in many respects skilfully constructed is yet at its foundation weak the woman travelling from the yukon is separated from her lover reaches her destination alone and dies soon after the childs birth the story then turns on the promise of her young sister a girl of 17 to bring this boy up as her own and to let it be supposed that he was born in wedlock and that she is a widow that a girl so young loving her unfortunate sister and in thc presence of death should be willing to promise this is conceivable  what seems to us curious is that after eighteen years when she is about to be married she should tell the hoy of his unhappy birth but yet allow him still to believe that she is his mother she thus sacrifices herself to spare her sisters memory and breaks her promise in its essential part upon this much that follows depends and it could only have been made convincing if pity and love for the memory of the dead mother had been shown to have some remaining power but this is not the case there are many complications in which socialism and labour unrest play some part there are also many good situations cleverly handled and several

new novel8 white rose of weary leaf by violet hunt heinemann amy steevens the best woman the really newest woman as one of the other characters describes heris the most interesting heroine that miss hunt has yet achieved that she is entirely human we cannot say but as the varied and not always pleasing incidents in the career of this waif of society are unrolled before us we recognise that she possesses the qualities of honesty and courage in an unusual degree and that they help to set her above the stale and squalid atmosphere of the divorce court with which her surroundings are tainted amy is at no time an adventuress in the ordinary sense of the word the necessity for a friendless girl to earn her bread in whatever way presents itself and the genuine passion for making herself useful which is her dominant characteristic combine to place her in those ambiguous positions which miss hunt appears to consider necessary for her heroines amys story really begins when for the second time she enters jeremy dands family as companion a post from which she had been previously ejected for interfering with a man in a parisian hotel who attempted to shoot himself now there is a second mrs dand and this pale clever girl speedily makes herself indispensable to every member of a peculiarly artificial household and not least to its splendid but rather uncouth master the ultimate catastrophe is approached with all the skill and originality of which miss hunt is mistress and when it arrives it is remorselessly complete the story is undoubtedly clever chiefly because while there is much in it that jars and no single character that is essentially attractive miss hunt succeeds in compelling our respect and sympathy for the white rose and that although she is one of those women  who live by their heads not their hearts  white rose of weary leaf fiction by violet hunt heinemann 6s miss violet hunt has written an exceedingly clever novel which is sure to attract a large measure of the reading publics attention also one may reasonably expect that the story will excite comment and provoke discussion the cleverness of the book is indeed so manifest that it may inspire a regret in the minds of some readers that miss hunt had not informed her subject with a finer or sterner quality there is a marked energy shown in the writing considerable ingenuity and in places almost subtlety in the characterisation  but somehow the author fails to quicken our sympathies or to stir our emotions amy steevens the heroine of the story illustrates this deficiency in the authors powers more than all the other characters put together amy is miss hunts masterpiece in many details she is sketched with a quite brilliant fidelity to nature she is a volatile character as quickwitted as a cockney streeturchin courageous in her many struggles with life shrewd peculiarly adroit in her management of persons whose intelligence have not been stung out of lethargy by poverty and want ready in speech and action and generally filled with the commonest common sensebefore she fell in love with mr dand nevertheless with all her many attributes of individuality and fascination amy remains even to the last chapter nothing more than a splendidly interesting companion we are always interested in her but we never feel for her she amuses us with her stratagems fascinates us with her adventures and finally draws from us a tacit acknowledgment that she has been a very unhappy creature whose circumstances in life have been ordered by the spirit of tragedy this ultimate admission is forced from the reader by the bare recital of her story  but it is impossible to shed tears over amy or to feel the tragedy that we know exists as with amy so with every other character in this remarkable book they all interest us by their sayings and doings amuse and tantalise us but fail to touch the pulses of emotion they are a barbarous set of people even to mr dand the middleaged country gentleman and peculiarly vulgar in their habits of thought dand in this latter respect is the greatest offender of all this person marries twice and to both wives amy steevens at different periods in her career acts as a paid companion the girl ends by becoming dands mistress and dies in giving birth to his child dand commits suicide as in some early chapter does a certain sir mervyn dymond who is perhaps the only unconvincing character in the novel as will be seen the book has more than its share of violent climaxes but the entire scheme of the story is unfolded with so plausible an appfeafance of truth sustained everywhere by the force and freshness of the writing that the reader does not pause to doubt or even question anything we accept amy steevens as a person who lived

the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity  the works of george meredith memorial edition vols ivl constable  co this memorial edition of merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use for the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciation  the works of george meredith 17 vols 6s each constable to fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  standard edition  of merediths works except the price the paper is good the type clear and of a comfortable size and the books tastefully bound in blue cloth with gilt tops eight of the volumes have been issued the two

the bands of orion by hon mrs n grosvenor heine mann 6s the novel has all the qualities good and bad of amateur work the writer has thought and felt more finely than she was able to express her thoughts and feelings her picture is clouded and blurred but gives the suggestion of something which has beauty and which is refreshing for that reason that beauty is seen especially in the close love of the two brothers arthur and richard dering arthur has genius but is unable to turn his genius to any account but he inspires richard with ideas and makes i him a successful novelist and richard recognises how much he owes to his brother arthur was bom under orton j the hunters star andi is a wanderer not even his love for clare can induce him to settle any yoke will always fret him and he knows it clares gradual recognition of the fact is handled with extreme delicacy and weight it is far the best thing in the book but the solution seems to us unconvincing and disappointing arthur dies and clare marries his brother we can imagine a marriage between richard and gare based on ties of memory and affection  but that richard should want her love and that clare should give it seems frankly impossible and in flat contradiction tot the characters of both which have not been shown hitherto to bein any way commonplace we are inclinedto feel that the author has come to the conventional lions and gone round without discovering that after all the lions ant chained and tame,random

crumbs from a sportsmans table by charles clarke 2 vols chapman  hall a medley of sketches gathered from a popular sporting magazine and of disconnected trifles about horses and their riders crumbs from a sportsmans table is a lively scrapbook containing things that are good and suggesting things that are better some of the coverside sketches are spirited and truthful  our county member is a very good portrait the chapter entitled  parson heathfield is tainted with the modern sportsmans cant which likes to credit hunting and shooting clergymen with a superabundance of christian charity and zeal having told how the parson stopped short at the most exciting crisis of a good run and pulled out of deep water a young gentleman who was sinking for the last time mr clarke exclaims enthusiastically now thats what i call charity and he will be rewarded for it though he lost the run what would the author have called it if parson heathfield for the sake of another ten minutes of keen enjoyment had left jemmy allcroft ba of trinity college oxford to die in the brook  if heaven can be won by such trifling acts of selfsacrifice there is not much truth in the adage which teaches that the thing which is earned without trouble is never of much value but though the reader smiles at mr clarkes anxiety to canonise parson heathfield he applauds the humour which makes the worthy rector say to his curate  choose your daysthree a fortnight and all i can say is this if you do your work as well across country as you do in my village you will take a good deal of beating andstay one moment allcroftdont go out any more in trousers if hunting is wrong for us its just as wrong in a pair of cord trousers as it is in leather breeches you will never lose the respect of yourself or other people by propriety of costume whatever your business and if a man wears a pair of trousers only to cover his inclinations he might as well be without them the sketch of dick crupperton  the gentleman dealer who makes his hunters pay for themselves is excellent on turning away from this gentleman the author observes  as dick gets older and the family increases of course the stud must decrease for amateur dealing requires a great deal of personal activity to make it pay you must look up customers and you mubt feed them  and though you may continue to buy a good sort you must buy them in the proper market and ride them well when once crupperton becomes a good sportsman and ceases to be a good riderwhen once he prefers to go through a gate to going over ithe must give up all idea of the stud paying its expenses it is quite true that these masters will not take their hounds home for him an honour several times threatened and once conferred upon him but he will have more friends if his acquaintances are fewer some of mr clarkes pieces are deficient in originality for instance the life of hunter an autobiography contains nothing new either in aim or treatment the same criticism applies to a very military examination  rotten bow also is an unsatisfactory essay  but on the other hand the  page from the diary of an impostor is a capital piece of fun broad in humour and yet delicately handled as a sporting writer mr clarke would be a far more agreeable companion if he were to cure himself of two reprehensible tendencies he says far too much about the millinery and upholstery of the field the polish of boots and the bloom of tops the merits of the tailors and the art of hatters costume in the field is a matter that well deserves consideration  but we dont want much noise to be made about it again like nearly all writers of books for sportsmen mr clarke delights to show bis knowledge of the latin books used by schoolboys he ought to get the better of this habit of quotation which it may be observed does not mark him quite so strongly as some of his contemporaries the usage is indefensible with less educated readers it serves no good purpose to

fond of socity and intending uone was suspicious of no wrongh he was a dauntless horseman and at that tinw fell casy a grand climax arid one very much to be desird  but what every one must look upon as essentallyrue is the monetary portion of harry fanshawes character to which we are commonplae enough to ascribe the chief portion of his sueesses gold covers a multitude of sins and no doubt if he had proposed to hunt his own fox as the pauthor say not a soul would have said him nay the question respecting wht are commonly called foxhunting parsons is rather a vexed one the authors description of parson heathfield and his defence of the practice of hunting amongst clergymen requires therefore a little consideration we are prepared at the outset to look somewhat more clemently upon the case not from the arguments which are here brought to bear upon it but from our own individual ideas upon this subject the character of parson heathfield is one which is by no means a rare one  if the pleasures of the chase were confined to such as him and to those of the cloth who enjoyed like incomes we contend there would be nothing reprehensible the 1am nimcfkn cnot as to the propriety of the action itself but as to whether the indulgence of such pastimes does not in a measure prevent the engager in them from performing the duties of his sacred office we cannot forone moment imagine that any one would be so narrowminded or bigoted as to say that the driving of a pony carriage the recreation of fishing or a game of cricket are engagements whih should be denied to the clergyman for these pleasures are within the scope of almost any ones means and are  not such as to wean his thoughts from graverk and more responsible duties the mens sacwxwill not come without the core sano  d prondod other 4uties are no neglectd  the caeih no har mu i these huntig is a otbr question we contend that parson heatihfied in the enjoyment of the income the author allots to him had a right to hunt three days a fortnight for he could afford to keep a curate to assist him  added to hich we are not rery certiain that in a county like leicestershire where every one hunts the presence of the parson is not only beneficial but an opening of the door to many a mans hearti who would not otherwise listen be that as it may the adthors  sketch of parson heathfield is one deserving of grteat merit and wa cordially reecho his exclabation when alluding to the prejudices of certain persons who would deny the cler every participation in the amusements of the world he says oh you old paasees just wash your own platters the waters of the wissendine are not the only things that soil the chastity of  the cloth the descriptions of the gentleman dealer and the london division are both true and ludicrous in alluding to the debut of mr peter scripp the  london stockbroker who suffered from a torpid liver and imagined that hinting and country air were the sole panacea for his co la hint which

sportsmans ablo by a pleasant amusing description of leamington and its attractions we cannot however endorse the sort of universal censure he passes upon the men who hunt from the spa we conclude it must be some little time ago since the author visited it and that when there he had some unfortunate rencontre which left an unfavourable impression upon his  mind leamington has produced and still produces some ofi the best men that ever rode to a coverside who go straight never crane or override hounds and invariably ride a line of their own the closing chapter on ladies and their habits we would strongly recommend to those of our fair readers who purpose ever to make a debut in the huntingoeld we leave this portion of the work with a regret which is somewhat alleviated by the cintents of part ii the first portion of this is devoted to the 1 life of 0unter an autobiography we seldom recollect seeing so much useful information given upon the bringing up of a young horse his education for the huntingfield and stable management than is here clearly and judiciously pointed out there is however a manifest indiscretion not only in this portion of the work but pervading tne two volumes which we are sorry to see we allude to the very disparaging way in which the author speaks of military men in connexon with horses hounds and hunting many of our very best judges and mfhs were and are still military men the army has ever been a good school for the bringing out of good material no doubt the young sub on joming gives himself airs and graces yet like a boy fresh from home on going o a public school this sort of nonsense is soon taken out of him and he acquires knowledge from the best of all monitors cc experience the advice of the vet in page 271 to the master is one which we shoulk like to see more generally attended to a horse sudffering from a bad cough and cold is injudiciously physicked  by his groom the vet in speaking to the master says the disease is quite lowering enough without taking away the little strength theyve got left just keep your eye on your own stableseo ent when you likeride em when you likebut 0 ont give up the reins if every master did this they would find themselves better off in pocket and horses than by trusting to their headgrooms many of the other subjects contained in volume 2 having appeared in baileys and other magazines it is almost unnecessary to comment upon them with the exception of the cosing chapter the history of the pytcheleyhunt the reminiscenceswof this truly to the foxhunters sporting county show a careful study of his subject together with an immense facility of memory we quite agree with the author respecting the game coverts especially that on braunston hill and we trust that the authors remarks may not be thrown away upon those who have the disposal and outlay of the 18001 per annumn which is yearly expended to keep these coverts up in conclusion the hunting com3munity especiaely those who can afford to revel in a glorious burst over our midland counties ought not lightly to feel the debt of oblgation they are under to the author for thii last bittruly not the least addition to the sporting ibrar  crumbs from a sportsmans tablr we have here a series of graphic sketches and anecdotes of hunting written in a lively and agreeable style which never oversteps the bounds of good taste and cannot fail to prove amusing to those lovers of the noble sport who though heroes in the field are  fond of light reading and prefer the entrees and sidedishes on the table of literature to a piece de resistance in the shape of history or philosophy the first volume contains thirteen chapters entitled  coverside sketches the headings of whichas our county member  a popular man  parson heatbfield the gentleman dealer  the professional dealer  of funkers and their habits cwill give our readers some idea of the nature of their contents and taken in conjunction with the following quotation will enalle them to judge how far the fare provided is suited to their taste  the heathfields of leathfield are of a very great family i mean one of our fine old county families in a land where blood has its value there is no place like grassington for that a county ball there is a county ball i can tell you a very fine solemn assembly of lords ladies and commoners who come together about halfpast eleven and separate about two the stewards having done their duty by paying for the music in such a convocation the heathfields are perfectly at home they know everybody can afford to be even familiar with the squirarchy and positively kind to the inferior clergy in fact it was is and always has been a very charming family and if that were all we had to say about it we might dismiss the subject in a very few words but the heathfields of heatbfield have higher claims on the historian they have peculiarities not appertaining to all mendistinguishing ma ks of hereditary pride deserving a niche in the temple of fame the family hasl always afforded a member for te county a parson for the rectory of heat hfidld and a fox from the family gorse since the time of the rump now a member of parliament is common enough and we might not have stepped aside to exhibit the pcrtrait of anything so vulgar bat a reverend gilbert heathfield rector of heathfield a county magistrate chairman of the union a firstrate shot and the quickest man for twenty minutes on his own side of the county is not to be treated thus lightly the second volume under the title of  roadside scrapings at home and abroad is mainly made up of light sketches of a similar character in one chapter headed  the prince of wales as a sportsman however something more than mere amusement has been aimed at to those who would deprecate the patronage of the turf by his royal highnesq our author replies that it is surely no compliment to the prince to tell him that he is so deficient in strength as to fall a prey to the temptations which thousands withstand or to bid him avoid a duty because it is hampered with certain perils to the courteous the weak or the selfindulgent and he then earnestly insists upon the great benefit the turf might derive from the influence and example of the heirapparent it exerted in a direction calculated to cleanse and purify this institution which has doubtless contributed so much to our national preeminence in horseflesh by far the most interesting chapter in the book however is the last the history of the pytchley hunt  from family mss in  crumbs from a sportamans table by chorles clarke

converse maintained we turn with no little curiosity to this chronicle of the achievements of the buntingfield a century ago the length of the runs and the extent of country crossed in pursiit of the fox cannot fail to strike the inquirer doubtless as is usualiy the case each side of the controversy will find matter for the confirnmation of their own opinions but without wholly becoming laudatores tem p acti as regards foxhunting we must confess that what we call good sport seems to have predominated as the rule and the length and other recorded features of the runs create the impression that

fiction memoirs of a fernme de chambre by the countess of i blmsincgton in 3 vols london 1846 bentley tile countess of blessington is certainly indebted for the popularity of her novels more to her title than their inerits a tale written by a real countess is by the patrons and patronesses of the circulating library looked to as an authority on all those curious points relating to the manners and mode of speech in fashionable life which the excluded are always so desirous to learn and perhaps to enjoy in fancy ihe greater portion of the fashionable novelists were understood to be persams who were not adhnitted into the circles they pretended to depict and who had picked up such information as they really 1ossessed in their characters of tutors and governesses valets and ladies maids or suchlike equivocal personages attached to a family at first the revelations of these people were received with eagerness and the  bilverforkschool  of novelists as they were happily termed enjoyed a run for two or three seasons but when their readers were beginning to ape the extra vagant modes and piebald dialects which had been palmed upon them as truthful dramatic scenes in aristocratic drawingrooms it began to be known that the picture was an unfaithful one that it was often drawn from imaginationnever taken from an higher sources than the wouldbe great then did this school of storytellers vanish as speedily as it had arisen but the curiosity to which they had sought to minister remained and a cordial wvelcome was given to an novel which bore upon its face some sort of guarantee for its fidelity in the rank of the author among the most sue cessful of these novelists was the countess of blessin gton and although her productions would not have commanded attention upon their own merits they were eagerly read because they came from a countess we mean not to assert that they have nothing to recom i mend them to notice they hare some good features the plots are rudely constructed and there is little of reality in the characters introduced perhaps because they are not usually painted from the life but made up of shreds and patches from a variety of persons known to the writer the truth is that the countess is an extremely amiable and kind hearted person she wvants the malice necessary to hit off the foibles of her friendsand give pungency to a tale of real life which is nothing without a dash of caricature tihis inherent defect is equally apparent in the memoirs of a femmne de chmbre rhe plot wants novelty and the personages wvant nature the heroine selina stratford is a governess whose life and adventures together with those of her parents it is the purpose of the novel to narrate the design is not new and the incidents are formed out of the staple materials of the novelist nor is theme any thing in the manner of the telling that compensates for the want of freshness in the matter but although this novel is not of a better class than i those every season sent forth for the supply of the circulating libraries it is at least as good as most of them which look only for a seasons existence it will do well enough to lounge over during a dull morning but the busy reader will not fin it worth his seeking,random

literature the works of edgar allan poe edited by john h ingram vols i and ii containing the collected tales london and edinburgh adam  charles black 1874 with jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although mr ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume i do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if i were just a little more mad than ever i waswe can say frankly this is what i am there is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  ligeiaas tothe expression of ligcias eyes he tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj though glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories they are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable if anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable circumstances  the gold bug  the descent into the maelstrom  the cask of amontillado  the oval portrait and the three stories about c auguste dnpin the philosophical detective if he should then desire to read more he may go on but warily there are trapdoors and springguns in these two volumes there are gins and pitfalls and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten one word on the services of mr ingram this edition has evidently been a labour of love with him let us hope in the next two volumes which are to complete the series he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of french which poe was so fond of scattering about his pages there are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under present considerationerrors i

a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them dr holmes unlike some othersmay still be trusted with a pen did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it i waltek lewin,random_contra

reades novel with the quaiit anl proverbial title it is never too late to mf d is not only the best novel which we hlive read this season but also one of the very few firstrate works of fiction which we have met wvith in our life generally speaking we do not like those novels which are written at a system tile bias is too predominant the purpose is too glaring throughout every part of the tale and prejudice too commonly occupies the place which 8hould be consecrated to the imagination these drawbacks generally take front party or more properly principlenovels all that charm of nature without which the web of fiction becomes lull and uninteresting but this is not so with mr reades novel it is a principlenovel it is aimed against a system and that system one of the most crying evils which afflict mankind and disgrace humanity it attacks that code of discipline which converts error into crime crime into madnesswhich makes pickpockets buriglars and burglars murdererswhich under the pretence of philanthropy inflicts tortures beside which the most cruel refinements of the inquisition ere as gentle mercieswhichi treats the criminal as a machine to be systematised and not as a soul to be saved it is levelled at the solitary separate and silent systemn of treating criminals it is evident that the atrocities committed at birminghalm gaol have supplied mr read with the text for his sermon the htorrible revelations which resulted from tile inquiry made into time discipline of that inferno are closely copied throughoutand inleed they i neededl no exaggeration to reach the higlest possible limit of horror they are copied we say incident by incident the re fined cruelties of the crank labour faisely weighted and taxing human nature beyond all powers of endurance in its fatiguing and monotonous work the cruel tortures of the punishment jacket an instrument which corn bined the iron collar and the scavengers daughter  of the old torturers the water dashes over the poor fainting wretch the salt cramnied down his parched and burning throat by hand fuls the dark cells which drive the stoutest iuiad the degrading whip the food cut down to starvation point and lastly the mental and bodily torture by all these horrible means so accumulated and aggravated that poor weak ignorant human nature sees and finds no other escape from its tortures but suicideall these things are related by mir read as taking place in  gaol under the reign of governor hlawes and his familiars just as credible witnesses proved upon oath before a commission that they took place in birmingham gaol under lieut austin and his myrmidons all this however is but ar episode upon the main story this is based upon the loves of a stout berkshire farmer george fielding and his beautiful cousin susan merton john meadows a prosperous and influential yeoman also loves susan andl has resolved to marry her at any cost under the cloak of respectabi litv this fellow hides as black and knavish a heart as ever throbbed in the bosom of the most hardened criminal he is the perfection of a deep vulgar hardheaded scheming fellow no knavery is too great f8r him provided lhe can only keep his respectability for this purpose hie seldom acts directly himself but employs some base tool to work out his schemes fielding is so hampered by the intrigues of this fellow that lie emigrates to australia bearing with him a promise from old farmer tmerton that if ever he returns with a thousand pounds lie shall marry his daughter meadows schemes to turn the girls heartproceeds with the cunning of an lago supseradded to the method of a man of business of the nineteenth century the scene changes to australia fielding is joined by tom robinson a reclaimed convict gold is discovurel life in the diggins glows upon the canvas with all the truthfulness of nature after various success true love is victorious fielding who wins not one thousand pounds but four returns to imarry his susan meandows is baffled just w hen his hopes for the consummation of his wishes are at their highest and the drama ends as all such irainas should happily for those for whom the sympathies of the reader have been enlisted froin the beginning to the end the gaol scenes are introduced as incidental to the career of tom robinson who is one of the minor heroes of the tale of these we have nlready spoken they are drawn with marvellous fidelity and fascinate the reader with a horrible interest which renders it impossible to lay down the volunie until it is concluded the dry bones of the birmingham gaul rleport are here vivified into a terrible reality and our sympathies are perpetually awakened as we perceive the truthfulness of the heartrending narrative the gaol scenes too give occasion for the introduction of a character which we without hesitation pronounce to be one of the very best in the whole range of fiction this is the chaplain of the gaol mr eden a man such as there are we fear but few in existencea man whom if he lived would be one of those chosen few whom the almighty sends upon the earth to soften the lot of poor erring miserable sinnersone indeed of those very few who constitute as it were the salt of the human species it will be almost invariably found that where the novelist introduces a clergyman upon the scene he falls into citherone or other of twoerrorseither he represents him in an unfavourable light as a canting worldlyminded hypocrite whose practises are the very reverse of his professions or else lie makes a saint of him without one single feature of humanity in hinm from theqiloria round his head down to the soles of his martyred feet now mr eden is a mana man of like passions with us alla man who feels for another and sympathises with his weakness because he knows how weak his own heart is there is a vitality a reality about this man which is surprising isle is as good as gold but when we have surveyed his character we do not fold our hands and say complacently that he is an impossibility but our hearts beat with high hopes and we ejaculate ohm that there were more like him  ve fear however that there are so few men like mr i eden that he himself is but the creation of the authors fancy the pendant character of mr lepel who is intended by way of contrast to represent the systematising so muelhpercent ctass of chaplains is probably a portrait for lie is introduced as  chaplain to one of thle northern anols and we fancy we can detect the original from whichl he was drawn the other characters in the novel are sketched with great power and fidelity george fielding and susan merton the central figures in the picture are charming i their contrast  he a manly real rustic she a sinple loving maiden john meadows is also a welldrawn ciaracter the incarnation of selfreliance and trust in money unbalanced by anyhing like a conscience or real principle a perfect contrast to this admirable work is suitshiine and sliadow by the anonymous author of  mtabelanytlhing more vapid more pointlessand more unnatural than this composition it would be difficult to conceive we suppose that it is intended to belong to that class of fictions which are termned faslionable novels of which carlyle has said that they of all the other productions of literature miost nearly approach absolute fatuity the characters are fashioned like dolls gaudily dressed up in the odds and ends of o0d frippery and they move about with thle painful elaboration of automata yet this is nothing but wrhat we expected when upon opening the book our eye

curb the power of the papacy and wrested from the hands of the holy father that temporal sovereignty which as mr mac cabe thinks he righteously possessed mr mac cabe has of course the worst possible opinion of those who attemlt to effect the liberation of italy whose efforts lie speaks of as tending  to fill italy with confusion war and bloodsaem this information will be sufficient for readers to

  new novels the edge of circumstance by edward noble blackwood  sons this is a book of altogether remarkable and outstanding merit it is a novel of a sort which does not always reach the reviewer even once in a year the authors name is not known to us but if he can turn out other books as good as the edge of circumstance mr conrad has a formidable rival mr noble is not so fine a craftsman as mr conrad it may even be that this is his first book though if that be so he has shown extraordinary literary ability and facility he writes of the sea of life on a cargo tramp which he appears to know from truck to keelson in its veriest details and its broad tendencies but the story is also concerned and deeply with life in the countinghouses of shipowners in cardiff and its principal oharacter is a jewish partner in such a firm of an utterly unscrupulous sort the drawing of this character is masterly a very subtle piece of work but in their way the portraits of a certain scotch engineer and a simple steamer captain are as good and this is striking proof of the ability of the author for the types are as widely separate as the poles among other things the story is a powerful indictment of the conditions and circumstances which are driving british sailors off the sea at the present moment it is a passionate assertion of the superiority of the english seaman over the  dutchmen and dagoes who are taking his place in british ships in these respects the book is powerful and admirable but apart from that it is a piece of literature,random_contra
  the balance of power bv arthur good i rich hodder  stoughton essentiailly transatlantic both in manner and in matter this industrial romance is filled with living and varied types of american humanity the millowner is particularly well realized though his desire to retain the surplus gains of former years instead of spending them in maintaining and improving his business would usually be associated with the european rather than the enterprising american the banality of the closing chapter is an unfortunate sequel to an otherwise excellent love story the central figures of the book are pleasingly pictured by otto toaspern but readers will do well to doubt the existence even in america of the trade  union agitator here depicted,random_contra
  my lady of the north by randall parrish putnams sons this tale of the american civil war has much vivid adventure and realistic fighting in it there is also a pleasant love story but the gallant southern captain is very obtuse in not finding out till so very late in the day that his ladylove was a widow not a wife we leave them however without any misgiving for their future unless a tendency to talk which is rather tall should prove occasionally fatiguing there is a comic man with a virago and a mule who relieves some tragic situations and the book is very well illustrated,random_contra
fiction the school for wives by andre gide translated from the french by dorothy bussy knopf 6s the essential characters stand out very clearly in this short intensive novel the husband is a fine type of cultivated impostor entirely selfish yet usually able to persuade himself as well as others that his motives are excellent whether in peace or war he is the successful shirker presented here with considerable freshness of observation his wife whose diary the narrative is supposed to be discovers that although she has no definite cause of complaint against him matrimonially he is repugnant to her a fact observed by her sympathetic and unconventional young daughter who shares her repugnance to add to the wifes sorrow her boy promises from childhood onwards to be a replica of his father she derives no comfort when while attempting consolation her own father confides to her his personal disappointment in married life we also have the wifes confessor who when preaching to her  the beauty of renunciation fills her with a new horror by promising her as a recompense the prospect of meeting her husband again in another world the very last  reward of virtue that she would choose  she dies when nursing at the front in i9i6 while he is at the base with a croix de giterre i it is not a cheerful story but it is by no means wanting in sardonic humour it may be added that the translation does not suggest the change from one language to another,random_contra
if sinners entice tltee by william lo qucux white  co ir is impossible to regard this novel as satisfactory of course mr le queux writes well when he describes life and scenery at nice and on the riviera for as we have remarked on other novels written by him he is painstaking and careful unfortunately his last published work suggests that ho has devoted his enorgy to though manufacture of artificial personalities who move like puppets through a conventional drama there is a mysterious murder at the end of the second chapter though heavy father of the early victorian stage is found fortunately only on his doathbod the conventional foreign nobleman duly appears as the complete villain and the virtuous love of a young man and a maiden is ultimately rewarded with marriage title and money one seems to have read it all before many a time from 4 the woman in white to the day before yesterday and yet the familiar dish is by no means badly served the gamingtables of monaco and the gamblers last stake are at least as well described as we have known them of old and a reference to the yachts britannia and ailsa shows how recently the picture was painted it is not quite clear why the villain should be described as having an arrestive face for the epithet adds nothing to our appreciation of his familiar features the minor characters are unusually well sketched we shall hope to see a better story from mr le queux in the near future,random_contra

more efllbrt to convince oneself that 11obinson crusoes adventures are inventions than to assure oneself that the records of history are truths probably this is not the result of art but an unconscious faculty in the writers by which they are enabled so completely to realise their ideas that the pictures rise up in the minld perfect in the minutest details whereas the imaginations of ordinary writers are ratheroutlines than pictures so defoe describing the scene suggested by his own fancy presents not merely the prominent figures but objects the most minute and incidents seemingly the most trivial and these are introduced with no effort but simply as things to lie named because they were ot real occurrence and the fict would be incompletely told without them the effect of this minuteness upon the reader is to produce a thorough conviction of the truth of a story told with so much particularity lie asks as lie goes along  w ho would have thought of stating this why should such a particular be described if all is an invention seeing that it has nothing to do with the story  now it is only necessary to feel an assurance of its truth to take an interest in almost any narrative the doings and sufferings of our fellowcreatures have an irresistible charm for us a really faithful story of the life of the most obscure human being that ever lived would be the most

scenes that hold the breath in suspense and in hairbreadth scapes that keel the curiosity continually upon the stretch they who remember susan hopley and who does not will readily understand the effect with which our authoress yorks up situations of this sort we will not mar the absorbing interest of the story by anticipating it  it will be read and it deserves to be real by all who ever indulge in a novel it will not be less popular than its predecessors whether in its present form or moulded into a drama as doubtless it will be ere long it is one of the few novels that every circulating library however small may venture to order secure of a remunerating circle of readers and which every reader may venture to borrow certain that he will be amused in fairness to the authoress we take but a single passage from a scene in which the heroine narrowly escapes being murdered with which the second volume closes it is a good specimen of mrs croavens powers in such painting a murder she was still lying cogitating on these matters when she was startled by the creaking of the stairs and in a moment her ears were on the alert and her eyes straining to the door and presently the latch was very gently but audibly lifted and the door was slowly opened then there was a pause and then it was opened a little further and some one entered the room closing it very gently lily at first concluded that it was the woman returned although the movements were certainly very different for she had used no caution whereas this person seemed to be extremely fearful of disturbing her a mother entering the room of her sick infant on whose lids sat life and death at issue could not have moved more inaudibly but as the figure advanced into the room and crossed the faint ray of light that still gleamed from the opposite window where some low revellers of the night were congregated she fancied that she could distinguish that this was the figure of a man be it what it might however it was moving towards the bed and at length stood close beside her and there it paused a while lwhat mystery was this  who was this midnight visitor that trod with such a stealthy noiseless foot that she was satisfied he wore no shoes  was it luke  she thought it was and during that fearful pause w memories crowded on her what had become of amr rylna w hat of winny westons lover  what was the signification of the scene in her dead uncles chamber whilst she asked hersei these things she perceived the figure stoop ing over her bending gradually lower and lower as if listening for her breath which zitn endeavoured to the utmost to suppress so that apparently unabie to ascertain by what means whether the bed were tenanted or not a hand was gently laid upon the coverlet this experiment seemned to satisfy the man if man he were and he immediately reassumed an erect position then there was another pause during which lilly almost turned into stone with terror lay as motionless as the dead whilst there was some slight movement on the part of the man which terminated il a faint sound like the opening of a stiff claspknife the sound was familiar to her because her cousins had such instrumentsstrong knives with horn handles and two or three blades then she would have screamed  but she could not lift hier voice and at that instant she felt that something fell upon the bd  the man had dropped the knife  whereupon he put down his hard to seek it but it having fallen betwixt the folds of the coverlet he could not find it this lily understood from lis atiotns  and apparently restrainer from a more active search hv tie fear of awaking her after a momentsist s tttion hie turned about and still with the same inaudilde stvprs and cautious movements he quitted the room the moment the door was closed lily put out her hand and seized thu knife which having fallen upon her hal slipped over to the inner side of the bed which by the way we should haste remarked stood against the wall she had not been istkun it was ai she supposed a large claspknife oen it was therefore plain that the man whoever he was had come to murder her andl doubtless having obtained anotder vve p n he would return and execute hi design this  however she immediately thrust under the nattraiq wiiat elsiuld she do now  where cry for help  who was in the

dared not there was the window antd tile light in the opposite roomthere were livers thereand trembling like a leaf she got out of bed and crept towards it first she must throw it up  that would make a noise   suddenly another thought strnck hershe might get the key and lock the door from within that is if she durst but open itbut what if he were standing on the other side however this seemed her only chance as it would give her timie to open the window and call for help so she turned in that direction but before she reached it she became aware that a footstep was approaching and impulse now taking the command and deciding for hlar in an emergency that left no time for reflection she instantly retreated and took refuge under the bedthe only place of concealment that as far as she knew the room afforded she had scarcely reached her refuge when as she expected the door openedl and the man as she supposed entered but with less precaution than before the latch was lifted and the door was closed audibly enough  and the step across the room was audible too till it reached the side of the bed  now thought lilly he will miss me and seek me and he will find me too and i shall be dragged out and murdered her terror and agony were inexpressible a space however of some six orsevenminutesensued an age of anguishto herwhento her surprise sbefeltthe bed shake above her and it appeared that the person had stepped into it and lain down how strange was this the man or the woman or sorue other visitor  she would have given any thing to know  but till they slept at all events that was impossible without discovering herself which she durst not risk doing so almost frozen with fear and cold she remained quietly where she was listening to the breathing of the person above her whicb very shortly from the longdrawnout and heavy respirations betokened that they slept and now lily debated what she should do next if it were the man that was lying in the bed she must either have mistaken his inten tions or he must have changed them but in either case she so much dreaded being discovered by him that painful as her situation was she would prefer remaining in it till he quitted the room again to the risk of betraying herself if on the contrary it were the woman the best thing she could do would probably be to make her acquainted with the circumstance and seek her protection or advice then again if she were sure it was the man now that he was asleepif she were but sure of thatshe might possibly creep out of the room and lock him in but amongst these difficulties and uncertainties wrought up to a fearful pitch of agitation and terror by so many strange circumstances it was not easy for a timid irresolute inexperienced girl to decide so there she lay still doubting and fearing till the opportunity for action was lost heavily slept the sleeper upon the bed with a panting heart and straining ears for what should next ensue watched lily under it  nor did she watch in vain for now again the latch is gently stirred and someone enters slowly softly as before this was the man she was sure she recognised at once the difference betwixt his stealthy approach courting concealment and that of the woman which sought none isle was therefore come back to murder her oh  the horror the anguish of that conviction  silently and inaudibly as before he advanced towards the bed she ratherfelt than heard his foot it was more the vibration of the floor than her ear that enabled her to count hi steps northeast v he is beside the bedwhat will he do next ere he can do tiny thing the woman wakeshe had placed his hand upon her face and whilst she seeks to put it away she cries  whos there  there was no answer but a sound betwixt a cry and a groan for the breath seemed impeded and the bed shook as in a fearful struggle there were efforts to speak or to scream on the part of the woman and muttered curses on the part of the manand still the struggle continued  till suddenly there was a strange gurgling sound and then it ceased and there was silence some minutes elapsed and then the man quitted the room  the story of lily dawson trf story of  susan hopley at once

the siege of florence an historical romance by daniel mcarthy ksq  vols colhurn in the notice of mrs gores  dowager we took occasion to call the attention of our readers to the present state of literature iu its moro popular departments and to its intimate connexion with certain particulars in the actual phasis of societya truth as we conceive of primary importance and hitherto much overlooked of these particulars the most remarkable perhaps is the increased demand for books and a consequent rapidity of intellectual productions among the many influences exerted by this cause there is one suiliciently obviousami that is a proportionate exhaustion affecting at  once the imagination of though author and the exi citability of the public it is not that the comi binations of nature or of society when measured  against human power are practically less than i infinite or that under any circumstances newfields would be waining to the operations of genius imt then it is genius alone that can  discover them md genius is not to be cleated at pleasure by a mere demand for its exercise when hoxvever inventive genius docs arise and it has extorted from society an approbation for its novelties they are seized upon forthwith by a host of innovators the forms are multiplied and the beauties frittered away in endless repetitions each for the most part differing from its predecessor only in thc inferiority of its execution the nexv form is no sooner recognized than it is worn to a thread  or if in a few splendid and exceptional cases superior p o xve rs  of combination are manifested they are still  manifested to a disadvantage for the public satiated with the overwrought model responds  not to the stimulus and receive with indilleri euee excellencies which formerly would have obtained signal success this forms a state of things equally irksome to both parties and both endeavour to escape from it through channels unfavourable to thc best interests of literaturethat is through an abandonment of simplicity and truth and the search after monstrous excitements from the most illegitimate sources there is on the part of the public a demand for what may bc termed a literary draindrinking and on the part of authors and cf publishers there is not wanting it corresponding eagerness to work thc illegal still and to serve the hot and poisonous product as much above proof as the strength if their alembic will admit it is the curse of all vicious excitement to provoke a desire for perpetually increasing stimuli and in the search after the means of gratifying this desire authors are bent on outdoing at all risks the former outdoiugs of their predecessors one writer labours to make his murders more niurdcrnti hi desperadoes more desperate his embroglios more embroiled and his moving accidents by flood and field more moving more unexpected and more impossible to all such series however there is a necessary term  the spring on which they are destined to act loses its elasticity and exaggeration defeats its own end nor is this term placed at any very remote distance others therefore abandoning the substance seek only to exaggerate the forms and throw themselves for ellect on the production of some absurd novelty of style such are the germanisms of recent introduction quaintnesses or a gorgeousness and a stilted elevation of expression which is neither prose nor verse but a condensed essence of the defects of both forcibly feeble and pompously inane and these affectations arc brought to bear upon worncut and cllote themes as the tinselled trappings of a theatrical wardrobe are sometimes employed to conceal thc mean and distorted figure of a wouldbe stage adonis others again place their hopes of success upon

of their relative excellencies must depend on the value ol the specific nature they have been employed to copy just as may be observed in thc comparison ol the dutch and italian masters hut one d the

that access ol hypocrisy now more frequently adopted to hide hom society as far as possible all deviations hum though prescribed standard that more rigorous reign of the decencies of life and the growing timidity in authors in their dibits to reproduce the realities which heave and glow beneath these studied appearances the concurrence of all these various influences has occasioned the tendency which we have noticed in fictitious narrative to arrange itself round two opposite poles a pole of lelinenient displayed in frivolities and superficialities in all that is conventional in society  and a pole of cynicism to which the seekers after the intense gravitate in their dibit to excite emotion by the representation ol the exceptional the violent and all that society rejects from its bosom of the animal or the moral man there is also another tendency of civilization most influential on modern literature which must not be omittednamely its disposition to advance though positive

the literary examiner thc poor artist or seven kucsiahts and one object 44 science in fable vau voorst this is a channing little story telling of many wonders of creation and suggesting more its object is simple enough  but the writer is a man of imagination and this carries him beyond the narrower fields of vision into worlds where thought is infinite the framework of the tale hangs somewhat loosely together and more has to le taken for granted tlmu a more artistical management would have rendered necessary yet it is extraordinary how much the author has contrived to say within the compass of the few fanciful scenes into which his story falls a thoughtful reader will lat down the little hook to meditate on some of the most vital questions that affect humanity in its double relations with the external aud internal world in this respect we are reminded of such writers as lessing and jean paul the substance of the story is a series of dialogues between a noor artist and a bee an ant a spider a fish a cat and a robin the poor artist leing a dreamy sort of person and his favourite and constant companion the fables of la fontaine he is in love as well as poverty  and his mind ia pexwliaiy disposed by circumstances very prettily related te be ssiisifive to differences of opinion on essential and non ussential tirings and to the fact that most matters in this woifd

female writers  pen passages like these  it was one of the soft spots in her somewhat austere character that she took thought about her gowns and was girlishly willing to discuss chiffons with a much younger and more trivial woman     jimmy was a little old man rosy and cheerful with a kindly crackling laugh     what are relics but as dried roseleaves whose fragrance is piteous p    her ladyship was one of an emigration committee which delighted in the questionable benevolence of sending away the youth of ireland to build up america     iboth were anarchists of a crude and harmless type considering they agreed it was extraordinary how many arguments they had the writing is not always at this pitch of excellence it is even here and there marred by curious lapses in grammar and construction the following will be considered irish to a fault  bridgets grandmother sat by the fire stirring a pot of indian meal which was boiling on the embers with a long stick not even invested with the piquant quality of being irish are such slipshod sentences as these there was some gay crockery on the redpainted dresser and some coloured prints of saints on the wall her ladyship used to ocaionally stop her carriage at mrs dorans door and display with pride to her english friends the cottae and the handsome lads whom she liked to thin were shown off by her benefactions  many a one

youth ocb the very moral of what she is today a lane industrious woman but hard and standoff and wid never a bit of pity in the four bones of her sure she was gettin purty hardy whin she put her cornethur on jimmy an more betoken it was because her timper had drumv another man from her that sbe took jimmy poor dacent man more of this sort of thing would be very acceptable in fact a great fault in the book is that it is lacking in dialogue very dolorous it is also  i feel says the consciencesmitten writer in one place that this is an almost unpardonably melancholy story  and in another  i fear this is but a dreary little narrative in which a wind of death and parting sighs lonely in yet another story we learn with dismay regarding a cheery greybeard the old fellow had his tragedy and the story which closes the volume is one of a great sorrow it seems that these stories appeared in the first instance in various periodicals and some of us who are jealous for mrs hinksons fame will not applaud the reissue of them in book form their substance is of the slightest and though the language is bear and there beautiful at times even rising to something akin to poetry as in this description of an irish is it really irish countryside the way lay over a couple of hills and glens and then straight down the mountainside to the golden pastures which are the setting to the sapphire hills yet it must be conceded that as a whole these sketches are unworthy of one who could write so exquisitely of the land of mist and mountains as at an earlier date mrs hinkson did in

buried alive or ten years of penal srvi tude in siberia by fedor dostoyeffiky translated from the russian by marie von thilo longmans the recent death of the author of notes from the dead house and the striking demonstrations of respect with which his funeral has been attended at st petersburg invest with a special interest just now the english version of that remarkable work published under the title of buried alive the descriptions of prison life in siberia which it contains are well worthy of being widely read serving as a useful corrective to the sensational accounts of siberian horrors which certain french writers of fiction delight in producing the principal drawback to the real merits of buried alive is that it is impossible to say what part of it is fact and what is fiction the author of the book really spent four years as a convict in a siberian prison and the sketches which he has produced are no doubt faithful to life still they have not the value which they would have possessed if he had recorded without modification what he really saw and heard during his time of bondage it must be remembered also that thirty years have elapsed since he was con demned to penal servitude and in this interval many reforms have been effected mr lansdell whose account of a recent visit to many of the siberian prisons was published in the contemporary review last october found them  in a much better condition than is generally supposed he states that the food per week given to a hard labour convict at kara is nearly double in weight that which is given to a convict in england and the amount of indulgences accorded to a siberian klatorjnik might deservedly render jealous a prisoner at dartmoor or portland dreary indeed is the lot of an english malefactor who has fallen into the hands of the law compared with that of his siberian brother whose imprisonment is alleviated by tobacco and enlivened by strong drink and gambling not to speak of the possibility of an occasional flirtation and the probability of a yearly theatrical performance at christmas among professional criminals therefore buried alive may give rise to grumbling but by other persons it will probably be perused with interest of the translation it is not necessary to say much having been made by a russian ladyit is sufficiently correct so far as descriptions of fact are concerned but the authors reflec tions at the beginning of each chapter have been rather paraphrased than translated the statement is somewhat puzzling on p 234 that the soldier on duty who looked at a convicts corpse being moved by a sudden impulse took off his sword and helmet and crossed himself a reference to the original explains that the soldier unfastened his chinstrap then took off his helmet and crossed himself a phrase in the description of the prison soup appearing suspicious it also was compared with the original the author is made to say  i used at first to be horrified at the numbers of black beetles floating about in it but my fellowprisoners evidently thought that they imparted an additioxalfavour to the soup and never took any notice of them the words which we have italicised are the gratuitous contribution of the translator or reviser the author writes simply and concisely the interpreter preters a more ambitious style for instance the words there were here murderers by accident and murderers by profession brigands and brigand chiefs are expanded into  there were among us criminals of all kinds and classes beginning with the man who had slain his adverary in a moment of blind fury and the highway robber and ending with the coldblooded murderer who delighted in the deathstruggles of his victim after mentioning that more than onehalf of the prisoners could read and write and that someone had used the fact as an argument to prove that education demoralises the masses the author says in the translation  the cause of the terrible depravity of our lower classes must be sought for elsewhere he really never said a word about the terrible depravity of the russian lower classes a depravity in which he did not believe he merely said  there are quite different causes for that ie for crime although it must be admitted that reading and writing produce seltsufficiency among the people but surely that is not altogether a fault xu id q id w r s ralbton,random_contra

adrift in the middle of the pacific ocean the subsequent career of his wouldbe murderers constitutes an episode of crime seldom equalled and never surpassed but we do not remember that they have ever been the subject of a romance either in prose or verse except in byrons poem of the island our authors are already favourably known for their tales of adventure in the pacific islands the inhabitants of which have been thoroughly studied by them  they have dealt with their ample materials skilfully dwelling with much severity on capt blighs tyranny which caused not only this mutiny but also an outbreak in new south wales from which colony he was unceremoniously shipped and sent home his heroism and fortitude in safely navigating an open boat for a distance of 1400 miles proved that he must have possessed sterling merit it is however with the subsequent action of the mutineers that the reader is chiefly concerned the story of the loves of the sailors and the women of tahiti  white men and brown womenwho accompanied them to pitcairn island may be somewhat erotic but probably it is characteristic of this unusual form of courtship the narrative of the crimes which followed is of course more or less fanciful murder followed murder until only one of the original crew of the bounty survived all these are sensationally recounted the strangest point of the story and this is trueis that the survivor adams instead of being brutalised by his surroundings developed into an earnest christian and educated the hybrid offspring of these unions with a success which scarcely corroborates the usual view of the incorrigible depravity of humanity their primitive innocent simplicity the total absence of immorality and their genuine good nature have been the marvel of the few who have visited that lovely isle to this part of their subject our authors have done but scant justice although they have alluded to it and yet they might have added a most interesting chapter to their romance the reader of the gold finder by george griffith white  co will be surprised by the contrast between the commencement and the conclusion of the story it opens with a murder a felony or two and an  accursed bloodlegacy all leading up to the conventional hunt for the treasure of a wrecked spanish galleon of bygone days the real purport of the story becomes evident about halfway through the book lt contains the adventures of a modern pirate equipped with steam dynamite cartridges and the most approved instruments of modern warfare not satisfied with this the author causes certain parties to fit out a piratecatcher of equally perfect design and equipment and the story finishes with a bloody fight in which the villains are destroyed it reads like the history of a latterday alabama and so far as the narrative is concerned it constitutes a very readable volume of adventure and seafighting the little goldmagnet which points with the greatest nicety to though nearest piece of the precious metal plays a very subsidiary part in this volume the author evidently thinks that it is capable of better things in a literary sense for he concludes with the assurance that the magnet

the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and

miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always the same with you people he cannot pay something   he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you   alas no monseigneur  but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass well  monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass again well she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition

wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other

the thing in the woods by margery williams duckworth and co 6s mysterystories with ghostly thrills in them are growing fewer possibly because the psychical research society has transformed so many spooks into commonplace and rather depressing things so that when we come across a yarn with a real thrill in it we are not over captious with regard to its probability or the manner of its telling this is a real mystery story concerning the likelihood of an uneducated yankee dutchman turning into a thing with long nails that made awful scratches on people and caused sundry horrors in some pennsylvanian woods at odd times lycanthropy is given at the end as the partial solution of the mystery but the author is wise in not turning up all the lightsa thing guessed at is always twice as impressive a j a thing known for an american story with an american doctor as its hero there is very little american ring about the book save for one old darkey and his rabbits foot the whole story the people and the language are thoroughly english this however is a detail though a few more yankee traits in the characters would have made the whole thing more probable in the meantime bearing in mind the scarcity of thrilling stories we welcome this as a fairly good one the scene in the pit of the ruined sawmill is gruesome enough for anyone and there is of course a love interest by way of relief,random_contra

once an idea of the equally genuine and lifelike sketches which are made to emanate from such a source and which are narrated with such unaffected spirit and such a delicate sense of tasteful simplicity that as mrs gore truly remarks instead of feeling ourselves to b perusing a novel or even a romantic series of historical memoirs we could fancy itlhe queen of denmark to be the mere journal of some obsvant courtiercircumstantial as dangeau and artless as pepys caroline matilda although her character is carefully s etc  is not however the polar star of the tale that position is

school would not for the most part have treated with the same forbearance and while it reflects credit upon the young literature of denmark so it also impresses us with a very high opinon of the public taste which demands so much refinement in its works of fiction the same just sense of the beautiful in forbearance is not only manifested in its most trying field but also on all other topics take for example the chamberlains idea of wit  it was not a witticism for wit should be free from malice or the old courtiers elaborate exposition of bon ton and again  nature and truth are ever certain to make their fortune at court like all rarities but be it observed only when they present themselves in a noble form  or in another place reality differs from fiction in this respect that in the former we cannot always see the leading thread whereas in the latter we must constantly be able to follow it and perceive the necessary concatenation but this last quotation is rather an example of a just than of a merely delicate sense of what is due to the historical novel which combines both reality and fiction at the same time there are some oversights in the translation as in the masquerade one where intruders are on several different occasions called  smugglers and old calais is spokeii of as being sadly mauled a word which is not at all adapted to represent the danes appropriate expression but apart from such trifles the 1 queen of denmark is essentially a family novel calculated to please by its style to purify by its good taste and to instruct by its lifelike sketches of danish life manners and feelings both in humble life and at court as it was in olden time the author has not written in haste nor till he was thoroughly master of his subject and he has consequently placed himself by this novel in a situation of modest rivalry with the best productions ofthe kind of which european literature can boast,random_contra

and in  the heart of the spring that is no unexpected quality though his reputation rests rather on his visionary suggestions one has noted before too but the power of it is growing in him the frequent association of spiritual truth with familiar circumstance this is the sign of the effective poet of the poet with vigour in his imaginings the great secret was whispered to the old magician in  the heart of the spring by one who wore a red cap and whose lips were white with the froth of the new milk to me the best are the six that tell the story of hanrahan the red hanrahan is a very distinct and special human being a hedge schoolmaster and a poet and a neerdowell too much himself to be just like any other hedgeschoolmaster poet or neer dowell but i doubt if ever the poets history has been set forth with such proud truth before without fear of the world for his shortcomings without seeking its favour for this  ruler of the dreams of men hanrahan is very vain and he loves notoriety he is of evil repute yet an excellent fellow withal in his convenient moods he is drunken very often with the brew of the little pot and sometimes with dreams he sells the book of wisdom for a pig the pig for whisky and after being disgracefully intoxicated has a night of splendid ecstasy the powers  passed through his dreams crowned with rubies and having roses in their hands and in the morning he awoke a roughclad peasant shivering on the earthen floor this episode is followed by his making unscrupulous loveand being ignominiously defeated by her careful eldersto a young girl he is the king of lovers if constancy be not asked for in truth cluna of the wvave an immortal sought him but she was repulsed for the earthly temper was on him then a vagabond with a  devil in the soles of his feet a humorous rascal who teaches english out of  the lives of celebrated rogues and rapperees he uses his schoolchildren as mediums by which to widen the sound and the fame of his terrible satires yet is he beloved of women young and old and much dependent in his tamer moods on human shelter and sympathy no one can curse more bitterly his enemies yet while lamenting his own insults as in the songs he made out of the grotesque story of the twisting of the rope his mind reaches beyond himself as he made them his dreams deepened and changed until he was singing about the twisting of the rope of human sorrows his last days were black misery pierced by visions of eternal beauty but by degrees the body made fewer demands on him and  it was as though he became incorporate with some more poignant and fragile world whose marchlands are the intense colours and silences of this world he died a sordid outcast ministered to by a mad vagrant when his body was found it was given a great burying and so let us all be grateful for the limitation of our gifts that keeps us in safe paths and likewise may all poets find some time an interpreter of such brave sympathy as this initiate of  the secret rose the tales are clear and simple on the outside as if for childrens eyes wise and beautiful on the inner side with a dangerous wisdom and beauty for their sweet and bitter secrets do not feed this worlds strength but they will only call fatally to a few the rest of us if we linger and wonder as at an entertainment will then go our cheerful prudent ways with apologies to the world for an hour of idle alien dreaming a m  the seceet eose the secret rose by w b yeats with illustrations by s b yeats lawrence  bullen ix is a hard case when the one right word for a critic to use is a word that has been so hackneyed so bandied about in vague characterisation that it has become rightly suspect and almost even tabooed yet hackneyed or not there is only one word which describes the quality of mr yeatss stories and that is glamourthe glamour of the celt his tales have a good deal of talk about magic in them more in fact than is to everybodys taste for not everybody can be brought to take spiritraising seriously but on every page in the book there is proof given of a magic to which all lovers of literature must be submissivethe natural magic of style here is no artifice of haziness no mist of words rather the extraordinary thing about these stories is the distinctness with which they bring present to the senses whatever is related take for instance a few words from the first one the binding of the hair which tells of queon dectira and the bard aodhs hughs last song upon whose prelude there broke in the alarm for battle  then he took down from a pillar his shield of wicker and hide and his bronze helmet and sword and passed among the crowd that went shouting through the wide door and there was no one left in the room except the queen and her women and the foolish king who slept on with his head against a pillar how that conjures up the sense of desolation and vastness in the hall that a moment before had been crowded  one seems to feel the noise of feet dying away it is all distinct but with the distinctness of a dream and mr yeatss utterance is like aodhs  dreamheavy the thing is done partly by a singular felicity of comparison as in this phrase a very old man whose face was almost as fleshless as the foot of a bird but chiefly by the distinctness of the artists own vision yet this constant appeal to the eye is never allowed to predominate or to mask the central thought which each study conveys as for instance  the heart of the spring which sets out the aspiration of the alchemist and lifes ironic commentary upon it dreamy as the stories are they are not fantastic their characters act with human coherency mr yeats is fond of the supernatural in the curse of the fires and of the shadows  he has introduced it for his own pleasure since in the tradition it was no one of the she who led the five cromwellians to their fatal gallop over the precipice but a simple peasant yet we like him best when he does not stir outside of the human pale the crucifixion of the outcast is a grim tale of the way in which respectable folk dealt with the strolling gleeman when respectability had full power to make itself respected  we suspect an apologue anyhow this is one of the only two stories in the book touched with the humour that made celtic twilight so delightful the other is by far the best of them all the tale or series of tales relating to the adventures of owen hanrahan the bed last of the gaelic singers in ireland here is a splendid touch the fjoet whose dower over women had been not ess than his passion for them sees a girl crying and offers help   my father and my mother and my brothers she went on  are marrying me to old paddy doe because of the hundred acres he rents under the mountain and i would have you put him into a rhyme as you put old peter kumartin in the days when you were young that sorrow may be over him rising up and lying down   i will put him into a uttle song that shall bring shame and sorrow over him but how many years has he for i would put them into a song   oh he has years upon yearshe is as old as you are owen hanrahan    as old as me said hanrahan in a broken voice there are twenty years between him and me if there is a day an evil hour has come for owen hanrahan when a colleen with a cheek hke the blossom of may thinks him an old man colleen colleen an arrow is in my heart beautiful as is the vision of owen hanrahan with its fine symbolism there is nothing in it worth that but beautiful it is a new and genuine inspiration from the old mythology of the gael the old gods are no more dead for mr yeats than were pan and apollo for milton  when one looks into the darkness he says in his preface there is always something there most of us look very little into the dark and we are inclined to retort that those who look into the dark see nothing but fancies yet such a book as this makes one ponder whether the light of common day does not blind us to many starry presences for all that we have no patience with the last and longest story  eosa alchemica which is totally distinct from the rest and resembles the recital of an opiumdream like everything else in the book however it is beautifully writtenin long slow undulating sentences easy and sinuous in their progress as the motion of a serpent the illustrations are admirable there are not many points of likeness between mr yeats and mr kipling but each has a father who draws beautiful pictures for his sons books print and paper leave nothing to be desired but it was a pity to use ridged not smooth material for the binding as it impairs the effect of miss gyles s intricate symbolic design for the covera model of decorative work  the secret rose literature r by w b yeats law t renee  bullen mr yeats has the courage of his celtic imagination if he thinks at this wrong end of a hardened century to arouse our slumbering saxon taste for allegory and symbolism though fashion of cynewulfs day is a little outworn and we have ceased to read guillaume de lorris with unaffected exhilaration yet here in an age of all the utilities is a young writer who invites us with though frank confidence of youth to follow him through the mystic byways of a new  roman do la rose it a fine enthusiasm for his theme could touch our hearts the appeal must surely strike homo but the hearts of some of us aro not in the right place and our heads are troubled with an intelligence a shade too analytic the authors heart is right enough  but he too suffers from the latterday trick of introspection it is the snare of even the greatest artists who imitate archaic forms or subjects dante eossetti in his ballads does not altogether escape it still less does tennyson in his  idylls of the king matthew arnold  perhaps least of all in his avowedly hellenic work such a passage as this from mr yeatss book may serve to show how the touch of a too modern spirit may hurt the harmony of oldworld sentiment   if you come with evil thoughts and armed men said the son of dermott flushing no matter how strong your hands to wrestle and to swing the sword it shall go badly with you for some of my wifes clan have come out of mayo and my three brothers and their servants have come down from the mountains of the ox  and while he spoke he kept his hand inside his coat as though upon the handle of a weapon 4 no answered costello  i but come to dance a farewell dance with your daughterthe girl lifted her eyes and gazed at costello and in her gaze was that trust of the humble in the proud the gentle in the violent which has been the tragedy of woman from the beginning the one word  tragedy7 quite apart from the sentiment of the conclusion imparts a disturbing element it has almost the air of modern literary slang again  costello led her among though dancers and they were soon drawn into the rhythm of though pa vaneand while they danced there came over them the unutterable melancholy though weariness with the world the poignant and bitter pity for one another the vague anger against common hopes and fears which is the exultation of love the reflection though it comes from the author and not from his characters is still a violation of unity an anachronism in sentiment a fault akin to this but less easily to be pardoned is seen in the absence of what for want of a better phrase may bo called the right local colouring let it be granted that mr yeats is sufficiently irish in his nomenclature and antiquities we have abundant local feeling in his namestho steep place of the strangers the lough of the little wood the town of the shelly river  every page is full of them there are also boreens and garrons and bodachs and other properly unintelligible celticisms but for all that we can seldom identify in his pictures the marks either of place or time we pass over a wide range of seasons from early christian times to at least the seventeenth century with scarce any sign to mark the change characters of all ages and conditions speak in much the same manner and if we except a desultory phrase or two their racial idiosyncrasies are but faintly revealed on the other hand it would be illnatured not to acknowledge our gratitude for being spared the local equivalent of the kailyard jargon but wo must revert to the question of symbolism for these tales pretend to mean more than mere tales of faerie mr yeats assures his readers in his dedication that they all have but one subject the war of spiritual with natural order and certainly in the broader issues of some of these stories the symbolic intention may be obvious yet when after the authors warning we search for esoteric interpretations in the multifarious details of his images the process is found to be futile and exhausting we are forced to give up the task and content ourselves with the human interest of the story itself which is often far to seek  or with the concrete beauty of his pictures or with the glow and grace of his eloquence but unhappily the high qualities of an eloquence which at its best has a conquering charm are not sustained had mr yeats brought to bear upon his work a keener sense of negative humour the absence of positive humour may be excused under the circumstances he would never have allowed us the shock of certain occasional lapses from the ethereal range of his poetic diction he would never have told us that  when they came to dermotts house they saw before the door an unusually large group of the very poor  or that margaret rooney had  some dilapidated remnants of tolerably good looks the bathos of such phrases can only bo appreciated by comparison with mr yeatss exalted manner purists as distinct from humourists may further complain of the fatal attraction of andto the relative in many places in this book rn finally after putting trivial blemishes a aside all who know anything of mr of yeatss exceptional ability as a poet will feel that in these prose stories he has not chosen the medium most suited to his remarkable powers now and again in a white heat of energy he  makes the live shape at a jet at other times he must himself be conscious that his material compels him to treat his themes too clearly and too explicitly to preserve the illusion of mystery as a writer of imaginative prose he takes high rank it is true among the men of our younger generation but as a poet of the school of shelley though author of  the wanderings of usheen stands alone some of the verses scattered about the present book are laboured in accentuation but he has proved sufficiently his mastery over form as well as matter and it is in the sphere of poetry rather than of prose that we look for the development of powers which promise a brilliant future it is to be hoped that there is no personal presage in his comment upon the works of certain authors found by him in the house of the order of  rosa alchemica where he says  i noted also many poets and prose writers of every age but only those who were a little weary of life as indeed the greatest have been everywhere and who cast their imagination to us as a something they needed no longer now that they were going up in their fiery chariots we know no young elisha who is quite prepared to assume the mantle of mr yeats,random_contra

through stained glass by george agnew chamberlain allen sc unwin 65 one of the most striking things in this novel is the suitability of the title the history of the heros life as a goatherd in brazil art student in paris and experimenting lover is presented in a series of detached episodes each one of which might suggest the subject for a window if the custom of telling a story in stained glass had survived the invention of printing we suspect a play upon the words however for the hero lived his life by the fight seen through the windows of his fathers experience and the latters reputation was by no means unstained regarded as a smooth and realistic biography the book would be unsatisfactory but it is interesting and novel as an artistic experiment the air of unreality is subtly and consistently maintained and the figures never leave their chromatic outlines sufficiently to suggest the warm solidity of living people,random_contra
st winifredt or the world of school i books for childben i edinburgh black  notwithstanding its too great length and a tendency to preach and sentimentalise in fashions that will unquestionably offend many readers  st winifreds is a manly hearty story that will win a place by the side of though wellknown pictures of public school life by messrs hughes and farrar one of its chief merits is the diversity of schoolboy character put before the reader walter evson the hero of the drama his brother charles a brave earnest highminded little fellow daubeny the conscientious goodnatured honest dullard howard tracy the supercilious patrician of the school henderson the wit of st winifreds jones and mack worth two distinct types of the publicschool bully are welldrawn characters though not altogether original conceptions the events of school life like college experiences are so closely reproduced year after year and generation after generation that novelty of incident cannot fairly be demanded of writers who illustrate the world of school but still the author of  st winifreds might have walked in less familiar tracks in the outofbounds portions of his tale for instance the appenfel excursion and its immediate consequences were clearly suggested by reminiscences of tom browns schooldays apart hoavever from an alloy of imitation and other important defects the sterling goodness of  st winifreds is so great that we close its pages with approval and predict for them many readers  st winifreds or thc world of school edinburgh a and c black this is a story of school life too earnest and in part too powerful to find its readers only among the young the writer has put all his energy into his work and has not the faintest idea of writing down to an imaginary level he writes his best and means with his whole heart all that he says there are touches of weakness mingled with its strength and the tale is too long failing somewhat in interest throughout the latter half for want of sufficient plot and by giving prominence to thc 13 w and r chambers 18 a hall and co 14 a w binnet 09 arthur hail and co 15 smith elder and co 20 jackson walfordaadhoddex 16 smith elder and co 21 s w partridge 17 hogg and sons didactic purpose the preacher to a certain extent gets the bettor of the storyteller but the interest although it languishes remains alive though reader who has arrived near the middle of the book with an impression that it is almost or altogether the best story of school life he has ever read finds himself though with lessening satisfaction fairly carried to the end whether he wiu or no if all that follows the most touching chapters on the death and burial of daubeny were compressed into at least half its present compass reconstructed and in part rewritten we might have here a better book than  tom browns school days or we could spare that whole elaboration of the fall of kenrick into evil and his ultimate recovery and the story would gain very much by being altogether snapped off in the middle if a couple of new chapters were furnished to round off the broken end of the part that is most worth retaining the purpose of the tale is to protest manfully against every theory of public school life which holds that a boy cannot be conscientious to the utmost true and just to the minutest word and act merciful prayerful modestly watchful for all good that his right hand may find to do without cant without being regarded as a milksop by his schoolfellows or being the less able to lead a side at football leap with the best laugh with the merriest and brave perils from which they would flinch who do not interpret their duty by the highest test of all and who have not a living faith to steady them walter evson the hero of the story of st winifreds is of course the writers model boy he comes to the great public school by the seashore from wholesome vigorous home training bold and strong to do right and to battle for it when need is with his schoolboys fists it happens that he is placed under a master who is rigidly just by routine and being unaccustomed to the school work of learning forms of words by memory instead of getting the facts represented by them into his head by understanding all his efforts tend only to the heaping of punishment upon punishment thus he starts in the school with a bad character is driven to desperate resentment and defiance and at last breaking open the desk of the master he has learned to defy he tosses the punishmentbook to be burnt and also crams into the fire a roll of ms which proves to be the all but completed opus magnum that has been the darling labour of the masters life when the truth is known walter is humbled to the dust but the master whom he has wronged so deeply conquers himself bears his cross half conscious of his own past error saves the boy from expulsion and by his own selfconquest secures walters heart but walter evson is now worse than characterless he is shunned and despised by all the school but he suffers and works patiently wins friendships among some of the better class and commands at last respect from nearly all his schoolfellows when at last he and two of his friends were caught in mists on the top of the great mountain behind st winifreds dangerous with risk of precipice and open deserted mines and walter evson by three times traversing the terrible razorback rescues himself and his friends he becomes of course a hero to his schoolfellows his friend daubeny a quiet amiable boy of slow wit and strict sense of duty who has been killing himself with overwork had failed in strength on the ascent and gone back he returned to pass into the sick room and there die of the two boys kenrick and power who faced death upon the mountain kenrick is represented as having a good character not based upon religion he has a poor home in the swamps of fuzby le mud where his mother is the widow of a good curate killed by the cruel aspersions of his ignorant parishioners kenrick has invited walter to visit him in the poor home of which he is ashamed and when he pays the visit the meanest boy in the school being in the same railway train happens to see the poor cart in which walter is driven off that boy hears also living not far away the old scandal against kenricks father when all return to school kenricks poverty and thc accusation against bis dead father is on many tongues and kenrick believes that only walter can have betrayed him so begins with misconstruction and the parting of friends kenricks decline into bad company among his schoolfellows his antagonism to walter and his lapse into what the writer of the story broadly calls sin the account of this and of the events that lead to his recovery and make a christian of him being as we have said the central thread of the narrative of school incidents throughout rather more than the second half of the volume although this leads to a vivid sketch of peril by sea and storm

information i may as well confess is derived entirely from the prefacewho is at this moment capouliw that is official head of the fulibrige the society of provensal men of letters being second in succession to mistral he has written epics and lyrics and stories in prose and conspicuous among these wst is this tale of the march of the marseilles battalion to paris it is a very remarkable work it is literaturewhich not one such story in a thousand contrives to be but just because historical romance is fashionable now i should recommend it with a warning to those who read mr stanley weyman and his entertaining brothers and imitators in england it is not a budoir version of a rough chapter out of a rough and terrible time it is very real and very ungenteel the marseilles men did not fight in kid gloves nor save when they were shouting their songs or their stereotyped cries did they utter fine sentiments no one at all in this story is told gff to speak words of horror or deprecation or to adjust the balance so as to be quite fair all round it is made up of the recollections of a rude untaught peasant boy that marched with the battalion who had no theories but sang the marsellaise with greater faith than he had ever sung a litany no philosophy of any kind blurred what he actually saw his story is a peasants story and told to peasants there is a good deal to find fault with the incidents relating to the marquis dambrun and his family and surto and l jacarasse seem like a hallucination and that the wretches should stifler death by the very guillotine on which the child they had plotted to kill had innocently written her name is a straining after an artificial effect which is below the level of the rest but indeed the story does not much concern a reader

macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,random_contra

the kiss and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in english  another would be sleeping or sitting at home with guests taribari rastabari talking but he the daylong circles about the steppe  nineteen to the dozen would be roughly equivalent to the peculiar words  clhtchedrine  is an unpronounceable version of the name of the satirist shchedrin a few notes would have been helpful an english reader cannot be

ind give the outline of the tale the scene is laid in a line old manorial countryhouse in a midland county the scenes are all well described the short preliminary sketch of the two families the wylders and the brandons is an excellent introduction to a dark and shadowy story there were wylders of brandon and brandons of brandon in one generation a wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the brandons the next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto the estates were back again with the wylders a statement of title is usually a dry affair but that of the dynasty of brandon hall was a truculent romance this strong bad handsome halfinsane halfdiabolical race who must have descended in aright line from cain or the corsair are represented at the period when the story begins by dorcas brandon the proud beautiful apathetic heiress of the manorhouse who seems to suffer for the sins of her forefathers rather than to partake of their evil nature there is a complicated coubinship of all the chief parties the wylders whose estates join those of brandon and whose people were every bit os wicked are about to be joined together in matrimonythe estates and the owners mark wylder a rough dark evilomened seacaptain who does not belie his blood having just succeeded to the wylder estates is on the point of marriage with his cousin dorcas he

and mark wylder never returns letters are received from him speaking mysteriously of his affairs and of some old scrape the consequences of which have obliged him to go suddenly abroad he sets his betrothed bride free from her engagement and letters on business continue to be received written by him from different continental towns giving directions about his property and speaking of his return the lawyer to whom his letters are chiefly addressed has a great deal to do in the story but his part is far too longall his chicaneries and attempts to overreach poor william wylder marks brother are wearisome and occupy the space needed for the dinohment some time after the departure of mark wylder dorcas brandon marries stanley lake the reader has been prepared for this exchangetho reader knows what a scoundrel he is without heart or conscience but dorcas brandon does not know it she is infatuated about him had determined to renounce her engagement to mark if mark himself had not saved her the trouble but stanley lake has difficulties and mysteries of his own in which he has involved his sister rachel and a dark terrible mystery gathers over the whole house of brandon there aro some touches of imagination which though they have nothing absolutely to do with the story heighten the interest and are extremely effective tamar the old nurse and though spectral figure of uncle lorn are powerful sketches though descriptions of places too are so well managed that rocks trees pathways ami even the very furniture of certain rooms add to the weird ghostly awe inspired by the dark

the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the

to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work

the quest of the golden girl the most delightful heroes of fiction have ever been knightserrant homeless rascals and questing pilgrims so mr le gallienne is on a fair way to win our favour by merely refusing to let his newest hero sit and wait till his ideal lady comes along to go on a walkingtour to find a wife may sound a trifle too deliberate for romance but then grant a little allegory and it seems all right of his companions of the road we have rather more than a speaking acquaintance with three or four alastor it must be confessed is our favourite and alastor is no golden girl but a charming boy with the star of hope upon his brow and  little wings of haste upon his feet eager for life but life in the empyrean with all the scorn of twenty for the cold wisdom of his elders we should indeed have preferred his company on the quest but we had only the chance of a short meeting then after sundry adventures we fell in with nicolete fishing by the banks of a stream an independent vivacious rather overmature young woman of twenty at least so we guessed from her conversation but the shrewd quester quickly made up his mind that though she was adorable she was a little too young to spend his life with a few days however he does not grudge and in response to her request they set off together and alone on their wanderingfor ever she believes as the sun is shining in the merry month of may we following at a discreet distance prepare to enjoy their adventure enormously but such is their haste or our discretion that we never quite know what happened on the waysunstroke perhapsto reduce the independent and intellectual young woman to sheer inanity when the angry father comes to take her off his hands the hero has our congratulations if not our sympathy then there is sylvia joy whose petticoat and stockings hanging on a clothesline he fell in love with and whose further acquaintance he made when he was benevolently meddling in the affairs of a young married couple who had played away their happiness out of a foolish respect for theory sylvia is quite evidently not the golden girl in his haste he said she would do instead only she preferred her own good professional incomeshe was a talented dancerto anything but the most substantial chance of matrimony semiramis the american with her air of pathetic devotion to every male being within the range of her eyes he perhaps never took very seriously for though they went through the mystic rite of  pressing each others feet under the table at their first meeting that apparently is not the kind of thing the golden girl is in the habit of doing and meanwhile a face had haunted him a face set round with chestnut hair which he met one day on an  apocalyptic moorland he met it again years afterfor the walkingtour did not end his questin piccadilly and it was set about this time with golden locks the quest is at an end his one discontent is with the altered hue time can undo what art has done but she prophecies the death of their happiness when the chestnut hue returns is there symbolism here perhaps it is our own suggestion not the heros that only whilst an artificial light dwelled about elizabeth could the romance remain mr le gallienne will not kill the romance he lets her die instead his hero is puzzled over the psychology of this woman of his heart so should we be if we accepted his view of the matter why should he not love a lovable outcast why to explain his devotion to an unhappy woman who has fallen low should he insist that in spite of all her history she was a puritan  to read sundayschool stories and to think atheists the most depraved of human beings is not to be a puritan he should have the proud courage of his love or give it up besides the girls of a more or less golden hue this hero found some other entertaining things he discovered the foolishness of theory for instance and pleasantly illustrates the same he promulgates some opinions and theories of his own too which we may find amusing without endorsing for example that gipsies being now along with waterfalls and ruined castles  the public property of the emotions no longer touch the private heart or stir the private imagination  likewise  that there is an opportunity for a new  the quest of the golden girl a romance by richard le gallienne 59 net lane form of novel in which the novelist    will skip all the dull people and merely indicate such of them as are necessary to the action by an outline or a symbol another theory of his that innocence consists largely of unconsciousness of wrongdoing  is more relevant to our criticism we base our doubt of the converse of this on the very book before us mr le gallienne is not at all unconscious he desires and mean to be naughtynot wicked of course but the result is innocent enough it is the naughtiness of a boy in his teens however that is suggested not that of a man in his thirties good enough for fooling distasteful for sentiment mr le gallienne is not always fooling but the truth is we are handicapped in our appreciation of his fantasy by the too wide difference between his views of the romantic and our own we knew it when we reached p 48 where occurs the story of the love of the lady of the manor she was once an actress for the village schoolmaster they used to meet in the dingle and laugh and love and drink champagne  when it all came out there was a regular cartload of bottles found there the heart of mr le galliennes hero waxed soft at the tale i retraced my steps to the common and rambled up that green lane along which the romantic schoolmaster used to steal in the moonlight to the warm arms of his love how eagerly he bad trodden the very turf i was treadingwe never know at what moment we are treading sacred earth but was the lodestar of that lover the eyes of his lady or the glimmer of the champagne bottles  under the  cartload of these our feebler sense of the romantic was crushed and killed a m  the quest of the golden girl by r le gallienne lane life was to r l stevenson a road on which he walked in boyish quest of adventure and this attitude of his has been adopted by younger writers with irritating frequency here the idea of a walking tour in search of the golden girl or ideal wife suits the desultory and fanciful irresponsibility of mr le gailiennes style the adventures of the hero related in the first person are very loosely strung together with little confidences to the reader and reflections on the lack of progress in the story which smack of  padding at other times the author is fluent to excess his reflections on a single look are 44 similarly in that moment i seemed to have dived into this unknown girls eyes to have walked through the

is more yet hut this will probably suffice and surely oaths barmaids ana whiskeyandsoda were out of place in a fanciful and frankly impossible idyl such as this mr le gallienne has enough wit and fancy to do without these wearisome adjuncts of some modern humour the plain sensuality of many pages the insistence on details modern taste has agreed to leave unmentioned is a much more serious matter sentimental journeys nowadays should surely leave out some of sternes effects there is here not to mince matters much of that odd and most uncomfortable coarseness which we are told on good authority distinguishes  the bright boy of fiction mr le gallienne can write a good deal better than he has done in the quest of the golden girl,random_contra

rather scrappy but what there is of it is fresh and to the point evidently miss dowie regards politics as uninteresting and indeed out of place in describing a happy country where the peasants own their land and where persons of the landlord class are not to be found  oppressions rackrentinig and evictions were unknown evils of that i was assured  and beyond this i felt that a political condition is not a bad one if you hear nothing of it the fortunate peasant proprietors of galicia printipally belong to the rithenian the pole and the luzul nationalities  the huzul says franzos p 3

known riding mountaineers save a certain tribe of the caucasus the breed of horses used by theni is also said to resemble those of their caucasian cognates keeping all this in mind writes loopold von lacher masoch the hungarian novelist p 193  it may be held with some show of reason that at the great wandering of the earths peoples when the slays were inl the van the ihuzuls were easily driven across the plains and pouned in the karpathians while their neighbours of the plains were split up broken and intermixed with the germanic races and later with huns hungarians tartars mongolians and turks thus the hluznts safe in their karpathian faistnesses preserve their haracter the the slav or if you vill admit it the caucasian character free pure and warked to this day no falcon can live caged so runs the proverb no ihuzul in bondage miss dowio was not much thrown with this wild and warlike people but consorted more with the ruthenian of the plain and the pol whose ancestors conquered and colonised the country however beauty and picturesqueness are the creation of the eye and the mind and a traveller so richly endowed as miss dowie would write an attractive account of her travels wherever her dan and beersheba were situated the charm of the book is undeniable the style and the matter are alike sparkling and bright the reader who can begin a fl in the karpathians and can close

too large miss dowic is we feel sure nothing if not sincore we will not therefore flatter her the flaw in this lively and readable bolok is a certain cheap cynicism or flippancy of tone franzos is generally admitted to be one of the two great living authors of south german y the son of a doetor in a little galician town the ilarnow of his stories franzos is par excelnce the hilumlorist of

not drunk too  no wonder that after the scene in the publichouse to which the peasants adjourned from their church miss dowie retired to a pine wood with  qualms of wrongheaded western disgust she did

valuation was again too much for the innkooper who upbraided her guest both as a christian and a robber the treatment she received from the ruthenian peasants and the polish gentlemen with whom she stayed was very different aliss dowios book is proof if proof were wanting that an accurate and picturesque account of a people can be written by one ignorant of their language in a country not five

sympathised with them in their hopes and aspirations le therefore knew the country and its inhabitants a thousandfold better than his more learned but less sympathetic predecessor as with diploiatists so with travellers the key to a good book of travel is sympathy with the people among whom you travel miss dowie has struck this note in every page of her book we have referred to the cynicism which crops up now and again but in truth this cynicism is not more than worddeep miss dowio describes with profound insight the poor ignorant peasantry she has far too much humour to be a severe judgo even

constance slierwood ail autobiography of th  sixteentli century new novels i by lady georgiana fut  lerton 3 vols bentley tales of religious persecution are always heroic the story of sufferings born for the sake of a creed which the sufferers believe to be the one supreme form of religious truth through which alone their prayers to the god and father of all can be offered have the power to make the heart of every generous reader burn within him for they appeal to the deepest instincts and highest sympathies of our human nature this sympathyis quite irrespective ofthe creed of the sufferers in stories all the political elements which gave rise to the strife are kept out of sight and we are shown only the innocent victims to the stern laws of the dominant party in troublous times so whether they be tales of the early christians persecuted under the roman emperors tales of christiana persecuted by other christians for points of inaccuracy in their formulas persecutions of the albigenses persecutions of the huguenot persecutions of the early reformation by the church regnant or persecutions of the roman catholics when the reformed church became dominant in england or the cruelties against the covenanters in scotland the reader can feel only sympathy with the victims martyrs give the supreme testimony to the faith for which they suffer and every feuowreatiur who reads their story feels proud of theil courage and constancy but that is because the political passions the fear and the deadly strife of tongues have all passed away and left un capable of discerning the still sad music of humanity which was ever going on in the midst of the confused noise and the garments rolled in blood we recognise in the sufferers men and brethren now that they can no more offend us by their diversities of opinion it is only on the surface of the ocean that the waters rage and swell a very little way below the surface is perfect calm lady georgiana fullerton has chosen for her theme the sufferings that religious catholics had to incur in the early days of the reformation when spanish armadas papist conspiracies and a roman catholic retender to the throne gave rise to penal aws against the roman catholics as severe and stringent as the fears of the dominant party could devise or their power enforce swarms of contemptible informers and  base betrayers of their brothers blood aroseas they have done in all times of persecution as they will ever do in her story lady georgiana introduces the record of most of the roman catholic sufferers whose names are many of them little known to the protestant general reader but which  are carefully enshrined in the memory of their  own church she also speaks of other men as  saints and martyrs who were deeply involved io the intricate politics and conspiracies of the period and who suffered for them quite as much as for their religion she paints from the roman catholic point of view and keeps entirely to the religious aspect of the struggle in her pages the catholics are oppressed men only desirous of worshipping with freedom in their own mannerwhich the laws then existing forbade under pain of death and confiscation lady georgiana fullerton always writes with grace and refinement she does not give highlywrought scenes of horror  on the contrary she is studiously selfrestrained and moderate the heroine is a fictitious personage a certain mistress constance sherwood a gentlewoman in the reign of queen elizabeth much attached to the ancient faith and connected either by consanguinity or friendship with many notable persons who suffered for their adherence to their religion most of the secondary personages are real people and the incidents narrated are for the most part quite true the references are given at the end of the third volume the story of constance sherwood is a touching picture of life under a reign of terror and penal laws there is no plot it is merely the record of the lisa of constance sherwood from year to yearof the fears temptations and difficulties under which she and her friends held fast their faith and of the testimony which many amongst them sealed with their blood the passages in the life of the countess of arundel and surrey are taken from the history of that noble house of course everything that could jar upon the readers sympathy is kept out of sight and all the catholics in the book are the most excellent of the earth the incidents of heroic generosity and selfsacrifice are told with a chastened enthusiasm which increases the readers admiration the sentiments which all the catholics express are of the purest and noblest religious virtuesuch as all christian men and women ought to feel lady georgiana fullerton has written a book  which no one can read without deep interest i g and she has written it in an admirable spirit s substituting the reformed religion for the s roman catholic it is just such a work as a  t pious

is a mere vistal opening in the woods from which only the underwood has been removed the more slender saplings have been cut down or rooted up the tangle of the parasitical plants has been torn from the trees the cane brake has been fired and the brush collected in heaps has melted away upon the blazing pile only a few stumpt of inferior thickness give evidence that some little labour has been performed by the axe eiven thus the clearing in a mere patch scarcely two acres in extent and the rudle rail fence that zigzags round it attests that the owner is satislied with the dimensions of his agricltural domain there are no recent marks of the axe not even thic gridling of a treenothing to show that another rood is required the squatter is essentially a hunter and hateg the sight of an

vividly the stirring scenes and incidents in which he has taken part that when he disposes himself  to tell a tale his readers take up his book like children anxious to hear the captain carries them through mazy paths and tangled wildernesses dragging his character through dangers that make his readers hold their breath for a time he is too goodnatured however to break their hearts by any fatal occurrence or if tragedy there must be it is the right people who come to grief those whom the reader rejoices to see punished but after going through more dangers than they have hairs on their head and doing more hard riding fighting and forced marching than would have served all the paladins of king arthur put together they escape at last the heroines in full beauty without a scratch or a freckle upon their complexions even their costumes not materially disarranged or worse for wear whilst the heroes always find fortunes in their forays so that they are able to buy a fine estate to settle down upon when the curtain falls the true and graphic descriptions of tropical scenery and natural objects keep the critical faculty of the reader quiet and make him to accept amicably if not with faith the wild impossibilities of the narrative in this present novel however we are ungrateful enough to recollect that we have heard a great deal of it before the captain himself has told it to us those who have read the war trail will recognise the description of the  butte huerfano and the attack ofthe handful of white men hythe arpahoe tribe of indians who besiege them upon it their chief the terrible  red hand is not unknown to us also speaking as children we should say that the captain makes up his tale as he goes along with so many exclamations and insignificant incidents that the story is delayed to our great impatience the captain indulges in terribly fine words and fine writing who ever speaking the language of men talked thus the encarmined blossom of the bignonia to me a symbol of the sweetest sentiment i had carefully preserved in a glass i had placed it on the dressingtable of my chamber with its peduncle immersed in water lovers male and female have in all ages we suppose put cherished flowers in water but they would scarcely recognise the familiar instinct under such wonderful terms lovers may and do talk a great deal of nonsense no doubt but a young man might record his preference of a blonde beauty in less stilted language there was another contrast that had at this time an influence on my hearts inclinings to an eye fatigued with dwelling long and continuously on the dark complexions of the south the olivine hue of azec and iberian skins there was a relief in the radiance of this carmined blonde c but we would have forgiven all that if the progress of though story had not been slackened to allow whole ages of this sort of writing to find a place we also complain that the author who although many miles distant could know and tell us all that passed in the secret interview between the mormon apostle and huhman holt the father of the two heroines also what passed in the glade of the forest and the despair of the young hunter in his solitude never  tells us a word about how marian went away with the mormon nor how she discovered his villainy nor how she escaped from him nor how she fell under the protection of walker the good indian we are indeed told something about his finding her tied to a tree but so confusedly and vaguely that ordinary readers will never make it out the  secret by which stebbins the mormon held the father of lillian and marian in his power is never properly disclosed the whole story is diffuse in unnecessary places and most unsatisfactorily huddled up and hurried over when it comes to pointe of vital interest captain main reid is more successful in his shorter and less ambitious stories when he keeps to the facts and does not go off into nonsense about feelings and sentiment,random_contra

the old house and other tales by feodor sologub translated from the russian by john cournos martin secker 68 the sweetscented name and other fairy tales fables and stories by fedor sologub edited by stephen graham constable  co 68 sologub is one of the most widely read of contemporary russian authors during the last ten years he has come into prominence largely on account of his mastery of the short story in the form in which it most appeals to russians his stories that is to say are descriptive rather than narrative and should be regarded as exercises in moods more than statements of events his work bears a close resemblance to that of lord dunsany although there is far more of it and sologub is more extravagant both writers enjoy the unexpected introduction of the supernatural into mundane affairs they share moreover a predilection for a quasioriental setting and nomenclature and they shed the same gentle satire on conventions of thought and manner the latest complete edition of sologubs works runs we believe to twenty volumes these include a few long novels some plays and two or three volumes of poetry the remainder consist of short stories many of them are no more than fables from such a mass it is easily possible to make selections which would convey entirely different impressions of sologubs powers and achievements the volume translated by mr john coumos is fairly homogeneous he introduces us to the more uncanny stories of his author they deal with persons obsessed by fears which project themselves into strange shapeswith men and boys dominated by some perverse flaw in themselves mr stephen grahams volume is more catholic though shorter he presents to us some of sologubs one  paragraph fables and those peculiar fairytales in which human beings and fairies meet quite naturally sologub seems to postulate for his stories that his characters should have the power to will their own world a lawyer calls for a fairy and a fair comes to hin children playing in the snow desire that the snowmaiden of their making should come to life and she comes to life such whimsicality when carried too far deprives the story of human interest sologub is by no means free from the charge that at times eli has in fact forced his postulate to such lengths that his stories have degenerated into mere exercises both the present translations are adequate but that of mir cournos keeps far closer to the original sologubs style or perhaps his mannerisms make him a difficult author for the inexpert m1r graham has paraphrased considerably but the general impression conveyed by him is accurate we may illustrate this by quoting the two versions of a passage from a story which appears in both volumes that of m1r cournos we may add is literal tir cournos sip rram it was a fourstorey hit was a fourstorey house in a state of darkpainted house with neglect the two ap two entrances he went iaroaches had a gloomy in at a great yawning look the gates in the gate and read the list of mxiddlestood widleagape occupiers flat no 57 he looked at the plates was not indicated he at the approaches the looked round for some first numbe r were here one to ask but there and there was no noo 57 was no one about at no one was in sight last on a little metal there was a white but plate eside the dirtyton at the gates and white button of an cleon the brass plate below tric bell he read  to buried under dirt was the houseporter the word  porter mr coumos is not impeccable his accuracy is to some extent counterbalanced by occasional clumsiness such as xio one simply couldnt be less mischievous than i only sometimes you cant help it and then in a reasonable sort of way each volume we may add arrived on the same day and was accompanied by a note from its publisher claiming priority of publication we may point out that the honour of having introduced sologub to the british public appears to belong to mr cournos one of whose translations appeared in thi new statesman in december 1913,random_contra
less black than were painted less black thar were painted by james payn 3 vol chatto and wind us we remember once hearing a story anent the bethnal green museum which recurs to us in forcible illustration of this novel one of the native visitors staring openmouthed at the pictures is said to have reached the climax of her admiration when a sympathetic friend imparted in awestruck whisper the hardly credited information that  they were all done by and i canvas coloured to order heads arms and legs grouped by machinery and pictures turned out by the gross was what inartistic experiences had evidently suggested to the  untutored mind as the natural order of things les extremes southeast touchent our experience tends to a rooted belief in the existence of a class of machinemade novels and our admiration is hardly second to that of the traditional old lady from whom we quote when we meet with one bearing unmistakeable traces of handwork whatever heresies may obtain concerning critics it is nevertheless a fact that to be able as in the present instance to pronounce a novel original in conception artistic in treatment and thoroughly readable as a result does afford the reviewer most genuine satisfaction but we must sketch the story which has won from us so warm a meed of praise and in so justifying our opinion we shall be doing no injustice to the reader since to indicate the plot is to show the least charm of the book it illustrates the laureates ideal being the story of a boys  maiden passion for a maid which in the end  makes a man of him it is a tale of true love begun in earliest childhood and beset by almost every possible social obstacle richard talbot the son of squire talbot of talbot tower is the hero and when we ae first introduced to him on a visit to his grandmother lady earnshaw he is a wrelldrawn and very loveable specimen of an etonian of seventeen something of the schoolboy something too perhaps of the scapegrace and certainly all the loveableness cling to him throughout his history his father leads the life of a religious recluse stiriving to  live down  the sins of a dissolute youth and between the morbid man and thc highspirited boy there is much love but little sympathy necessarily thrown much for companionship into the society of grooms and gamekeepers dick naturally develops his strongly inherited instincts for their pursuits and perhaps quite as naturally falls boyishly in love with the bright beautiful little daughter of george parkes a gentleman whose antecedents are hardly worthy even of his present position in the squires preserves lucy and  master richard  are about the same age and some episodes of the  calflove stage are prettily sketched a kiss however which is exchanged and overlooked in most humorous circumstances brings affairs to the knowledge of the elders and to the consequent parting friends of course interfere  the clergyman and his wife and dicks  cousins and his aunts and even his own especial chum  pussy greene all protest in their several ways against the impossibilities ot such a marriage and finally the girl herself gives back her troth for a village maiden of seventeen it may be objected that she evinces quite exceptional gifts of sense and resolution  and we are afraid that the wisdom and tenderness which events subsequently show her to possess might be deemed exceptional in a maiden of any degree but it is nevertheless a consistent character throughout and a very charming one dick  gets over it to all appearance and goes to college is somewhat wild and reckless and when ha comes into his fortune contrives to dissipate it with alarming rapidity but through it all it is evident that the rare capability  to love one maiden only and to cleave to her is his and and in the end they marry and are as happy in spite of all drawbacks as such true love deserved the social complications which ensue on their marriage are extremely well told but hardly admit of quotation  handwork however is as evident in the sketching of the minor characters as in the distinct portraits of the hero and heroine we took an especial fancy to lucys good ugly dwarfish  aunt susan whose  piety waa of the most crude and simple sort it had no colours but thento use a vulgar but very expressive phraseit  washed  v ii p 172 equally good in her way too ia mrs freeman the before named rectors wife who  had not an angle about her except at the tip of her tongue and who indulges in that most provoking habit from which we all occasionally suffer at our friends hands of  having foreseen it all alongwhatever it was  pussy otherwise leonard greene is one of the full lengths and seems to have been done from the life he is delightful and gives frequent other evidence than the authors word of possessing a sense of humourthat precious gift which makes even ruffians endurable to him who possesses it and the absence of which in the gentler sex is the cause of no little of their unhappiness and discontent v ii p 171 we have no space to particularise or to quote from the other dramatis personae it is emphatically a novel worth reading and not the least of its attractions to us is the fact of ita being true to its title pessimism in so many forms ia fashionable nowadays that it is pleasant to be reminded in a roundabout way that we are after all less black than were painted the novelist in these times finds a larger audience than even the popular preacher and it is refreshing to find one occasionally who is not unmindful of his responsibilities and who holds the wholesome theory that in the long run  beauty of form has but a short start of cleverness and but a little longer one of goodness which once having overtaken it in the affections moves on with strides that the other can never rival v i p 59 we call this healthy doctrine and it is worked out without a suspicion of preaching which indeed would destroy the effect but as a set off against the detestable aubumtressed heroines from whom we so often suffer and who seem to rely mainly on their back hair and their bigamous tendencies for our sympathy the novel which makes a lucy lindon the

the well at the worlds end a tale by william morris 2 vols longmans co far away at the verge of the  oceansea beyond the  wood perilous beyond swevenham and goldburg and the castle of abundance and the thirsty desertnay even on the other side of  utterness  itselfthere lies at the worlds end a well over which are written these words ye who have come a long way to look at me drink of me if ye think that ye be strong enough in desire to bear length of days  or elsedrink not but tell your friends and the kindreds of the earth how ye have seen a great marvel though for ages upon ages men and women thinking themselves strong enough in desire to bear length of days have been yearning to reach this well which is none other than that famous fountain of youth that man has been dreaming of ever since his eyes were first opened to the busy wonder of life and the mysterious peace of death few have been those who knew the taste of its waters we for our part doubt whether any person ever did really succeed in drinking a full draught from that fountain save one the writer of this beautiful storyy william morris himself the illustrious poet whom we have lately lost and with him lost how much of the romance and the colour of life  but it was hardly by seeking it that morris lit upon the well it was by the workings of the natural instincts within him no child that in its halfconscious gambols always finds and never seeks ever came more easily more instinctively upon the beautiful things that could please its eyes than william morris came upon the waters of the fountain of youth nay it seemed as though the well at the worlds end was brought to him no need to travel except in imagination across the  wood perilous and the  thirsty desert in quest of the fountain of youth if the well at the worlds end comes bubbling up at your very feet as you design your wallpapers at queens square or hammersmith or superintend your tapestrylooms at merton or examine your upholsteries in oxford street or write your poems wherever and whensoever you can find halfanhours breathing space from a score of different kinds of the work that is your only sport this is why morriss position among the poets of the world is unique he though a poet stands for all time as the very type of youth though a poet we say  for as a rule few people age more quickly than does your poet and no wonder for like the nightingale of the romanies the more he is pricked by the thorn on which it is his fate to sit the louder and the longer does he sing shakespeare lamented the forty winters that had besieged his brow coleridge called himself old at the same age byron was old at thirty but no other poet of whom we have any record was ever at any period of his life so young that he could have written this story compare morriss delight in the beauty of the earth in the birds of the wildwood with that of any other poets delight in these things  compare the talk of the lovers beneath though trees in this story with anything to be found in any of the poems of such venerable bards as chatterton shelley and keats if morris at sixty had not reached the mature age when he could have written thus  there was a listening fear in her regard as if calamity had but begun  as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up assuredly at twentyfour keats was too old to have been able to write as morris writes in this volume of the beauty of earth and the joy of life what was called the  melancholy tone of the earthly paradise was but the expression of his regret that even the waters from the well at the worlds end were not powerful enough to enable the drinker to enjoy for ever the beauty of earth and the witchery of woman matthew arnold in a noble prosaic line which is often called poetical says of sophocles that he saw life steadily and saw it whole this steadiness and wholeness of vision is the very opposite of the youthful way of seeing fife it is in brilliant little pictures coloured with beauty that youth sees the world and it is thus that morris always saw it indeed there is not a weakness in his work and not a beauty which does not spring from that ebullience of youth which he drank and was always drinking from the well at the worlds end when keats wrote beauty is truth truth beauty  that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know the words did not really comprise his philosophy of life as a score of passages in his letters will show but of morriss law of life these lines are a full expression upon this axiom that  beauty is truth truth beauty his social theories no less than his artistic were based that generous heart of his became after middle age deeply touched with pity for the peopletouched because he saw how cruelly the folk were shut out from the palace beautiful which nature intended them to enjoy and he ran his head against the closed gates of the palace though to him they had been thrown wide open and beat them with his hands and cried let the folk in  any and arriet and all whether his preachings from the socialistic tub of hammersmith broadway did good or illwhether they opened the eyes of the eastend to the iniquities of the middleclass patrons of tottenham court eoad chairs tables and wallpapers as some think they did or merely turned goodhumoured vulgarians into sour morose and insolent ones as others affirmis a question altogether beyond our scope here the nobility and the beauty of his intentions and his aspirations none has ever challenged and every word he uttered was that of a generoushearted youth who saw life not steadily and whole but unsteadily and partially and in little pictures the artistic selfindulgence the self  pleasing whimwhich is the characteristic of youth is the basis of all morriss work as poet as artist and as doctrinaire though with the full conviction that if the world did not join him in his tastes it was so much the worse for the world he worked always to please himself most other poets after youth is gone arrange a compromise a modus vivendi between themselves and the taste of the time  a man must needs be more like the age in which he lives than he is like his father and mother says the chinese sage it is youth that knows not the word compromise nor did morris know that word whatsoever work pleased himself he did and if the public liked it so much the better for the public at one time when browning was his hero iu poetry it gave him pleasure to write rugged and more or less obscure dramatic idyls these he produced heedless as to whether he would or would not please anybody but himself and his friends afterwards he found a new pleasure in writing in the very opposite style to that of his first volume long narrative poems in smooth chaucerian measures but without securing chaucers nearness of atmosphere the public might or might not care for such a return to old forms that was their matter after this having become fascinated by the northern sagas he found a still newer pleasure in writing a kind of prose poetry bristling with archaic locutions and archaic words taking no heed of newspaper gibes about  wardour street english c he continued to write them till death stayed his hand the step from this fancy of writing in obsolete euglish to printing books in an obsolete type was not a wide one and soon no printing gave him pleasure that was not either in blackletter or in some type akin to blackletter at the root of all his beautiful work in a word there lies the whim of pleasing himself which is the chief characteristic of youthof extreme youth whether this selfindulgence will or will not prevent his work from being accepted as it would otherwise have been by posterity is one of the questions which time alone can answer black  letter we know can never be revived man has already awakened to the fact that wonderful as have been the few thousand years of his past his future of a million years is going to be more wonderful still posterity will be far more likely to favour some kind of phonetic symbol that saves time than the type which morris loved and what about the archaic diction and locutions in which he delighted  beautiful to our minds at least as is this  wardour street english it is after all an artifice and as such does not strengthen but weakens the full illusion which the worker in imaginative prose is supposed to seek the moment that in any imaginative picture artifice is obtruded where even art is weak unless she disguises herself illusion which must be always born of the artists sincerity begins to grow dim had the verbal texture of these stories not been imitated from books but been the natural and inevitable expression of the writers mood the combined beauties of the old literary temper and the new of which the stories are so full would have made them surpass in charm most other things in imaginative literature but not even the movement of morriss splendid imagination can prevent us from feeling as we read that the raconteur is a modern man whose natural speech is modern english and who is indulging here the selfpleasing whim of a marvellous boy the truth seems to be as the present writer more than once remarked to morris that if he really wished to throw around the reader the veil of full illusion which most imaginative artists in prose endeavour te throw around him he should have written these stories not in the epic but in the autobiographic form then the archaisms that are interspersed in the narrative would not have seemed to the reader more artificial and therefore more insincere than those in the dialogue of scotts novels the accent though strange would have appeared the natural accent of a dramatic character this is easily seen if we contrast the beautiful realism of the dialogue between the characters who live in the story before us with the movement trammelled if fascinating of the narrative portions surrounding them here is an example of an admirable dialogue between the hero and bull shockhead one of the wandering baud of brigands who judging from their use of the patterin would seem to be gipsies  early next morning ralph arose and called bull shockhead to him and said   so it is bull that thou art my wartaken thrall bull nodded his head but frowned therewithal said ralph   if i bid thee aught that is not beyond reason thou wilt do it wilt thou not  yea said bull surlily  well quoth ralph  i am going a journey eastaway and i may not have thee with me therefore i bid thee take this gold and go free with my goodwill bulls face lighted up and the eyes glittered in his face  but he said   yea kings son but why wilt thou not take me with thee  said ralph  it is a perilous journey and thy being with me will cast thee into peril and make mine more moreover i have an errand as thou wottest which is all mine own bull pondered a little and then said   kings son i was thinking at first that our errands lay together and it is so but belike thou sayest true that there will be less peril to each of us if we sunder at this time but now i will say this to thee that henceforth thou shalt be as a brother to me if thou wilt have it so and if ever thou comest amongst our people thou wilt be in no danger of them nay they shall do all the good they may to thee then he took him by the hand and kissed him and he set his hand to his gear and drew forth a little purse of some small beasts skin that was broidered in front with a pair of bulls horns  then he stooped down and plucked a long and tough bent from the grass at his feet for they were talking in the garden of the hostel and twisted it swiftly into a strange knot of many plies and opening the purse laid it therein and said  kings son this is the token whereby it shall be known amongst our folk that i have made thee my brother  were the flames roaring about thee or the swords clashing over thine head if thou cry out i am the brother of bull shockhead all those of my kindred who are near will be thy friends and thy helpers and now i say to thee farewell but it is not altogether unlike that thou mayest hear of me again in the furthest east  but then comes the question what kind of illusion did morris really seek in these storiesstories which notwithstanding a certain affinity with the methods of the sagamen must be characterised as a new form of imaginative art in judging of the success or nonsuccess of anything in imaginative literature the first question to ask and the first to answer is this what is the nature of the imaginative belief that the writer asks of the reader does he endeavour to compass the full illusion which is effected by the modern novel or only that partial illusion which the poet seeks  while nearness is the quest of the worker in prose fiction remoteness may be and often is the legitimate quest of the poet these stories are in atmosphere far more remote than the  canterbury tales chaucers quest was nearness of suggestion and this is what makes him so much more modern than a prosewriter like malory so much more modern than a poet like spenser even when morris modelled his work in some measure upon chaucers he never achieved chaucers nearness of atmosphere  perhaps he never tried to do so it would almost seem that in order to find a substitute for that aid which metre can give to the poet whose object is to produce a sense of remoteness morris in these stories goes out of his way to surround the dramatic action with all kinds of improbabilities when shakespeare introduced lions into the forest of arden it was not done in order to produce remoteness for the acted drama of the modern world whether written in verse or prose is unlike the acted drama of greece in this that it takes a place between prose fiction whose quest is full illusion and unadulterated poetry whose quest is partial illusion shakespeare introduced his lions because the audience of his time would scarcely have felt that a forest in foreign lands would be complete without them but why does morris introduce lions and apparently the entire fauna of africa into european forests unless it is to secure remoteness and so give a reason for the archaic nature of his form if however it was morriss desire as we are suggesting to achieve the partial illusion of poetry another question arises in connexion with the well at the worlds end is there any proper length for a narrative  and if so what is it although very much longer than  the roots of the mountains  the well at the worlds end is entirely without the grand pathetic motive of that story after the assassination of the heros first mistress the lady of the castle of abundance when it has become evident what the peripeteia is going to be the story becomes a mere string of incidents which could have been shortened at almost any point and here one of the most noticeable of all morriss artistic gifts his fecundity of invention of incident leads him astray in judging of the proper length of any work in imaginative literature it seems necessary to illustrate our meaning by examples taken from the two opposite kinds of prose fiction two of the greatest masterpieces in the prose fiction of the nineteenth century are very likely vanity fair on the one hand and  undine on the other long as is  vanity fair it is not by a single sentence too long and short as is undine it is not by a single sentence too short with regard to vanity fair so complete has been the illusion achieved by the writer so entirely has the reader accepted the characters as real that he reads the last lines with a feeling of regret that they are the last he wants to follow still further the adventures of that wonderful becky sharp round whom the other characters cluster and in the same way short as is undine the reader feels on reading the last lines that to have said more would have tended to weaken rather than to strengthen the readers imaginative belief now in the story before us morriss method is as entirely that of poetry of the remote kind as in the stories of  the earthly paradise he seems as we have said to go out of his way to show that his quest is the partial illusion which the poet alone is except in the case of chaucer expected to secure and yet after having taken all this trouble to make the reader feel that he is in fairyland morris spins out his story into a poem as long as a realistic novel of modern life he seems to forget that howsoever lovely a fairy story may be human life is much too short for readers to want to read it at such length as this a mere string of adventures such as these would have had far more effect had they been told at a third of the length that nothing can possibly be simpler than the main thread of the story we can show in a few words rumours of the well at the worlds end and stories concerning the many people who have perished in trying to find it and of the few who have drunk of its waters reached ralph the younger son of king peter of upmeads and fired him with the wish to drink of it and one day he stole away from his father and mother in quest of the well scarcely had he left home when chance or providence or fate threw him across a maiden of the yeoman class ursula who also had a desire to seek the well this maiden attracted ralph and no wonder for she was as fascinating as any of the women to be found in any of mr morriss poems   and she went hither and thither about the hall and into the buttery and back putting away the victual and vessels from the board and making as if she heeded him not and ralph looked on her and deemed that each way she moved was better than the last so shapely of fashion she was  and again he bethought him of the evensong of the high house at upmeads and how it befitted her  for she went barefoot after the manner of maidens who work afield and her feet were tanned with the sun of hay harvest but as shapely as might be  but she was clad goodly withal in a green gown wrought with flowers but if ursula made an impression upon ralph he made upon her a deeper impression still for although she felt her passion for him to be hopeless she straightway abandoned the lover she then had in order to find the well at the worlds end and so become worthy of ralph for the waters of this well have the power of transfiguring the drinker both body and soul and give him the power of dominating over mankind by force of wisdom as well as youth and beauty after leaving ursula ralph remembered for a time her charms but he passed through many adventures and at length encountered a siren who completely drove out of his mind all memory of ursula this was the famous lady of the castle of abundance one of the few who had found the well at the worlds end and drunk of it and become in consequence irresistible to all human kind of the male sex but extremely disliked by the female in ralph however she encountered her match for if she conquered the men through the magical power she had imbibed at the well he conquered all the women through his natural endowments of beauty strength and chivalry and especially by his freedom from any desire to conquer them and these two lived together as lovers in the wild  wood and she undertook to conduct him to the well the descriptions of their life during this period are extremely beautiful their bliss however soon came to an end for one day after ralph had left her to shoot deer for their dinner the husband and tyrant from whom she had fled found her and slew her notwithstanding his grief ralph after a while pursued his quest of the well and now that the siren was dead his thoughts would again recur to ursula who as was pretty broadly indicated during his travels was on the same road as himself and was very likely to cross his path as in fact she does after many adventures and escapes from many perils they reached the well at the worlds end and drank the waters ending their days as king and queen of upmeads but whether or not these beautiful stories are apt sometimes to become overlong the reader will say would that the beloved storyteller were with us still to tell new storiestell them by the score nay by the hundred if it pleased him to do so would that william morris

the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the

suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about the place he starts for the neighbouring town a few miles off and deposits the moonstone with a banker there by the time the birthday iarrives rachel has refused another cousin godfrey ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them

been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old

have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing her husbands attachment to his offspring by phyllis by parting with her trinkets kirke and preston find phyllis while she is yet in the hands of the slavetrader at a village store in north carolinah er figure was slight and graceful and her face very beautiful she bad long black glossy hair straight regular features a rich olive complexion and large lustrous eyes which as she sat opposite the open door were fixed on the thick gloomy wood with an earnest almost agonised gaze as if she were reading in its tangled depths the dark uncertain future that lay before her never shall i forget the expression of her face never have i seen its look of keen intense agony and its full perfect utter despair one of the children was a little girl of eight years with a sweet hopeful expression a clear rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons plantation near newbern here we find that prestons humanity to his slaves is ruining him and that with a hundred and fifty darkies he is going to the dogs while a certain colonel dawsey with only seventyfive works his estate at a profit preston explains how the colonel is so successfuldawsey has seventyfive slaves forty childbearing women twenty men and fifteen children under five years the sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their children and the waking rest necessary to working people he never whips them on a weekday because it wastes working time but makes sunasy a general flogging season he has two women where he has one man and each woman is expected to bear a child every second year if she doesnt she is sold they are made to work in the field till the labour pains are on them and arm allowed only two weeks res ar confinement three of them have born children in the woods this season he keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children and as soon as each child is five years oldthe ag at which it can be legay sold awra from its motherit is disposed of to the trades in addition three of these women are his mixtresse and they must bave children as fast as the others he serves their children like the rat that is rears them to the age of five and then sells them as he would so many hogs mr kirke does not confine himself to details which tell against slavery his deseption of ms preston shows how the highest womanly qualities can flourish side by side with the most hateful of social institutions she was a perfect womana faithful mistress a loving wife a devoted mother an every want of her husband rully inscting breon overseeing every detail of

writes are seen nowhere more often than in the south her husband too was solicitous for the religious wellbeing of his slaves his connexion with phyllis had terminated with his conversion to nobler thoughts and he taught his slaves their catechism and regularly attended the ministrations of the negro preacher old joe his grandfathers son by one of the old reprobates slaves side by side with the negros pitiable condition there is a vein of irresistible grotesqueness running through his life in nothing nmore remarkable than in his religious exercises joe had a rival in his clerical vocation a negro named jack whose gift was prayer and whose predilection was whisky the predilection was necessary to the full development of the rift mr kirke went to hear him open the sunday service gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment he drawled out my bredrin less us raise our hearts ter de lord the whiuce congregation then kneeled and jack closing his eyes clenching his hands together and throwing his bead back until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building  lifted up his voice and prayed  after the fashion of very many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob us dat hab come inter de worse sence hab stumbled an broke de law case he did how noah though he was a white man and had a white wife begat a black son and how that black son was a great sinner and how all his descendants have taken after him and been mighty big sinners ever since  then he described the sinner particularly the black sinners preeent and if half of what he said was tie every one of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed frank and selma to the family pew tittering laughing and flaunting their redandyellow kerchiefs the black people were enjoying themselves amazingly when  dar dey comes darm de happy pussons went round the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand before them  rosey was

those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all

illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread

bound to win ound to win a tale of the turf by hawley smart in three volumes londoa chapman and hall 1877 captain hawley smart has the peculiar power of con cocting a by no means uninteresting story without a single possible character and with hardly one probable incident in it from beginning to end his tales of the turf have a decided fascination for a large class of readersto which we ourselves belongwho possess a secret awe and admiration for the mysteries of horseracing without being sufficiently initiated into the refined subtleties of the science to detect those slight technical inaccuracies with which we understand the writer of bound to win is occasionally taxed by the  cognoscenti as he styles them we however can only look on with wonder as at a snakecharmer while the gallant author fearlessly toys with his enigmatic array of dark horses  rortees knights of the pencil dumb jockeys and other such equine phenomena and a peep behind the impenetrable scenes of the turf is so gratifying that we will not allow our faith in oar guide to be shaken merely by a trifling skit in a comic contemporary the plot of the present work is one of those which only captain hawley smart can produce and its development affords great scope for his special talents by the provisions of a singular will the hero of the book harold luixmoore owner of some extensive racing stables is on pain of losing an estate and a bride bound to winti a certain derby au unscrupulous cousin next in the entail is thus interested on the other hand in preventing this happy consummation the efforts of these two young men to attain their respective objects form the story harold luxmoore is not a person of much importance in the book although presumably the hero he is rather passed over by the other characters even his own grooms appear to have but a small opinion of him and bestow their respect rather upon his friend the ihon jim laceby or the honble simply as the author usually styles him upon this last captain smart fairly lavishes his eulogieslie can hardly find words to express his admiration of this pet creation he tells us with tears of paternal pride in his eyes that no cooler man existed than the hlonble jimnor harder he could walk all day after grouse play whist all night and come down looking serene as if he had been put to bed with the children he would ride a fouryearold at an oxcr in the middle of a quick thing or stand a cracker on the favourite with equal placidity  he sometimes languidly murmured in the shibboleth he aflectcl that  lie had got it hot  come to grief  had a rosy time or something of that sort but his equality of temperament never seemed disturbed and yet according to his lights jim laceby was no fool the anticlimax here is certainly

fiveandthirty of medium height with quick glittering lark eyes and a somewhat defiant manner the result of his doubtful position c this unprincipled youn man has on hand not only his own black plots against his relations derby prospects but also on behalf of a blighted admirer of harolds plans for preventing his marriage which involve the interception of letters c through the medium of a ladysmaid it seems to us a pity by the way that captain hawley smart should introduce the somewhat hackneyed and still more improbable incident of a spy contriving to conceal himself behind i conspicuous  straight tapestry screen some eight feet in height during a most important interview between two lovers we can hardly expect from a writer whose whole soul is bound up in the stable and paddock a very finished or lifelike picture of anything so unequestrian as an ordinary young lady all the gallant authors female portraits are thus somewhat unfinished while what there is of them is a little inclined to be conventional his injured widow has of course  long dark lashes  shapely shoulders and a  pure contralto and his heroine  red tints in her rich brown tresses  and a  delicatelymoulded figure robed in light muslin neither description possesses very striking originality we had much rather he told us that they were  well ribbedup though a bit groggy in the pasterns or  flat in the fore hand but a trifle slackloined however we have our fill of these seductive phrases in their proper places   now mr laceby what do you think of this one  hes the forwardest colt we have though not the oldest hes not the good looks of coriolanus or the substance of lacedemonian but he shows signs of being wonderful fast strikes me as too flashy and i dont like a washy chestnut theyve generally a soft point in their character what do you call him and hows he bred  hypocrite by beelzebub out of happy land ive doubts about his staying but hell be bad to beat as a twoyearold on account of his speed i fancy  how about those forelegs he continues addressing the trainer flat and like iron  look at his quarters theres hocks for you theyll want no irons pasterns long springy and elastic as indiarubber ribbed up barrels are no use to him  c such passages as these abound to our hearts content the accounts of the races are really good of their kind and are always excitingly given the story does not contain a moralunless it be some deep sporting maxim patent only to one who can  stand a cracker on the favourite and know what lhe is doing wvhen he does so but if captain

fiction a tale of the mutiny on the face of the waters by flora annie steel william heinemann mrs steels new story has been sj highly praised already vide press notices passim as quoted in the advertisements that if it were merely for the sake of a change one would be inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses there is a danger we hope it is no more that a somewhat uncritical admiration for the work of the clever lady who has now come to be spoken of as the female rudyard kipling  may do harm both to the authoress and her public the description is neither elegant nor correct for mrs steels resemblance to mr kipling begins and ends in the fact that both write about india from intimate personal knowledge and that the resemblance should strike both critics and public so forcibly is a remarkable sign of the novelty with which this inside handling of indian subjects came upon the masses in whose name our great dependency is ruled is it too much to express a fear that mrs steel has been tempted by thi reception to imagine that she has a mission to inform the british public about the true history of india  in her latest book at any rate the element of history seems to us entirely to overbalance the fiction we hasten to say that so far as the facts are concerned they are admirably portrayed mrs steels capacity as a historian of the indian mutiny is undeniable she is soaked through and through with knowledge of the environment in which she sets her story she is no partisan and her heroworship is combined with justice but after all fiction is fiction it is with some apprehension that the present writer who was one of the first to call attention to the power and beauty of those short sketches of mrs steels which came out anonymously in macmillans sees the authoress compelled to begin her new story with a preface insisting on its historical accuracy and explaining that it intended to be history as well as  story in her own criticism that in such an attempt she will probably fail in either aim mrs steel seems to us to be a better oritic of herself than most authors are it is not from a novelist that we want  every incident scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather it is not for the writer of fiction to boast that i have not allowed the actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings let the local colour be correct by all means but wc make a fetish of realism if such restrictions are put upon what in its essentials is an imaginative art the account of though sham court at delhi says mrs steel  did not need a single touch of fancy in the presentment what a singularly humiliating confession this statement should be if it were true in point of fact as all writers of picturesque history know it cannot be literally true it would only mean that the fancy of one writer was adopted by another and when that other is herself an artist in fiction the result if faithfully pursued would be a literary calamity not so do the great artists use history as scott in ivanhoe or george meredith in vittoria they learn its uses and its limitations the test of the historian is his accuracy but the critic must test mrs steele as a novelist not by her descriptions of the real scenes of the indian mutiny nor by her clever transcriptions of the chronicles but by the human beings and human characters wbich she invents the passions and ideas with which she invests them by the play of her creative talent round the creatures of her imagination as they move through the world which she has chosen as their environment and by her capacity for making an artistic unity out of the variety of circumstances it is in this respect that on the face of the waters is weak the desire to tell the whole history of the siege of delhi has interfered seriously with the human interest in the story up to p 210 there is a definite elot in the relations between major erlton is wife and his mistress but when mrs gissing falls the first of the women victims at delhi mrs steel violently removes the whole moral situation to which she seemed to be working upremoves it just at the climax when mrs erlton learns that another woman is to be a mother by her husband in a scene which till its natural sequel is ruthlessly cut off is full of promise for the working out of a most interesting problem of life alice gissing is certainly the most human of the characters in this story her relations with erlton whose wife is represented at first as bound to him by the nominal tie only are described with rare and even audacious sympathy  and when this chain of circumstance is abruptly snapped there is nothing to take its place the final two hundred pages one half of the book have no real human interest except the historical one mrs steel apparently intended the relations between jim douglas and mrs erlton to supply it but the sympathy of the reader is not aroused their adventures in the town in hiding while the mogul reigns in delhi and the british troops are besieging it from the ridge are most brilliantly narrated but they are the adventures of isolated beings both of them as bloodless as any men or women could be in such a situation and mrs steel evidently felt the mechanical aspect of their union after major erltons death when she relegated it to an appendix this division of the story into two parts one dealing with alice gissing and major erlton and the other with mrs erlton and jim douglasdeprives it of unity which is not adequately attained by the part played by douglas in both portions what unity the volume has is given by its history of the siege of delhi and to say this is to praise mrs steel the historian at the expense of mrs steel the novelist while we maintain that a great novel is not to be composed bv giving an historical background to several brilliantly interwoven episodes it must be admitted that mrs steel does ive us of her best in the way of episode in on the face of the waters all that relates to the natives whether to the sepoys or the court or the town is admirable and the sketches of british military and civil life are absolutely convincing mrs steel sees detail everywhere and records it minutely but she is full of humanity in the broader sense and can give us the mysticism of the oriental as faithfully as the easyoing morality of the angloindian each incident almost each chapter is a picture by itself revealing an extraordinary wealth of descriptive power and a masterly insight into character the disappointment is that with so muoh that is brilliant by itself the book as a whole finally lacks the intense interest which would be expected but mrs steel is so exceptionally gifted that we shall hope to see her shake off the disintegrating tendency which has so fatally pursued some of our best writers of sketches and short stories  novel notes on the face of the waters by f a steel 6s heinemann we do not meet with a novel of this order once in ten years it is a monument of patient labour a storehouse of precise facts on its imaginative side it is strong and deeply impressive architecturally it is a wonderbut we did not recognise this very early mrs steels aim was to write a history of the indian mutiny which should at the same time be a work of fiction the fiction to serve the history by lighting it up with living human interest as to her facts she says the reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part which real men took in it is scrupulously exact even in the date the hour the scene the very weather a critic of fiction has most concern with the other part and there we hold that mrs steel has used her vast array of knowledge with great skill that she has made us realise as we never did before the signs of the oncoming storm the mystery and tragedy of it the sensations of the natives loyal and disaffected and of the angloindians no one has taken such trouble before save historians and they have left the imagination out of the fineness of the detail it is impossible to speak too highly or of the great mental force that has shaped the mass of facts personalities sensations into a whole but it has the defects of its qualities a reader is sometimes overwhelmed dazed and baffled by the demands on his attention such a book should be given its best chancewhich is the careful consideration of ample leisure it is not a playhour novel but a bit ot hard reading with matter in it to reward the labour and to rouse the keenest admiration for the writers force and her sympathetic imagination  on the face of the waters new novels by flora annie steel heinemann mrs steel says in her preface  i have not allowed fiction to interfere with fact in the slightest degreeevery incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part real men took in it is scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather nor have i allowed the actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings this statement is we believe strictly accurate and the local colouring is singularly exact the tale too is as valuable as it is interesting for it gives an excellent insight into the native side of the indian mutiny and into the characters of some of the leading personages  such as for instance the king and queen of delhi the moulvie and bukht khan on the other hand it brings vividly before us the conduct and bearing of some of the principal fighters on the british side such as nicholson and hodson moreover it most wholesomely revives our recollection of the scandalous behaviour of the majorgeneral commanding at meerut and the want of energy and independence displayed by brigadier archdale wilson the author notwithstanding her general accuracy has perpetrated one or two little mistakes for example she defines krani as lowcaste english whereas it really is the contemptuous term applied to halfcastes again she is historically inaccurate when she writes of the rifle brigade having been engaged at budle  ke  serai it was the 60th rifles who took part in that action the rifle brigade not having been represented in india till several months later viewed simply as a novel the book is well and vigorously written but we regret to find that the author is unable to shake herself free from the objectionable habit prevalent among so many lady writers of dragging in the sexual question freely this blemish renders the work unsuitable for young people,random_contra
ginxs baby his birth and other misfortunes our library table strahan  co the author of  ginxs baby has wished to give good advice for the moral maladies under which society labours and he has enveloped it in a kind of jocosity which as often happens in the case of medicines for children is little fess distasteful than that which it is intended to sweeten moreover the comic element is so awkwardly mingled with the serious that its purpose is betrayed at once and we are repelled instead of attracted the story if we may so call it which serves as sweetening to the preaching is as follows  ginxa less grotesque name would have served the authors purpose equally well it is not funnyis a navvy and the baby is his thirteenth child on the birth of the twelfth ginx had vowed to drown the next and proceeds in due course to carry out his vow he is met as he goes to vauxhall bridge by various people among them a philosopher which gives the opportunity for a lecture on malthusianisma subject quite proper in its due place but liable to become improper if treated jocosely the baby is ultimately rescued by a man who takes him to a convent of course the nuns and their confessor have names which are meant to be funny but only succeed in being foolish from the convent he is taken by the protestant association and we have a little chaff of exeter hall and ito proceedings but we will not pursue ginxs baby through his varying career suffice it to say that after being exposed several times in the streets taken to workhouses and rejected by them he at last is adopted by the reform club becomes a page bolts with the spoons and ends by the very fate from which he had been rescued in infancy for he drowns himself from vauxhall bridge we are left somewhat in doubt aa to the panacea which the author himself would recommend for our social ailments  it is either a scheme of emigration or an alteration in the law so as to enable parents to drown their superfluous children from the general tone of the book we should say he means to suggest the former course but on the other hand a remark at the end of the book together with the catastrophe itself incline us to decide for the other we see all rights are reserved including we presume that of dramatising the story now if we may be allowed to advise this is what the author should do let him recast it in a dramatic form leaving out most of the moral part and introducing an immoral part let us say a byplot of an intrigue between sir charles sterling and sister something in the convent get one or two set scenes of vauxhall bridge by moonlight and such like and send it to the theatre if it does not in that form draw crowded houses for six monthswell we shall have our opinion of the modern taste in dramatic matters enormously increased  inxs baby his birth and other misfortunes strahan and co i london 1870 what a london navvy earning eighteen shillings a week ought to find society prepared to do with his thirteenth baby is a question easier asked than answered the historian of the son of ginx is rather severe upon the philosopher the police force the charitable agencies the parish authorities and the club politicians who somehow fail to make life pleasant to his hero  yet they do more for him than for the twelve brothers and sisters who were never threatened with drowning and are guiltless so far as the author explains of any sins of commission which should leave the infant like douglas jerrolds st giles no choice but to grow up in criminal habits to begin at the beginning a wandering malthusian suggests that on the whole ginxs baby had better not have been born he is suppressed by public opinion with a confused sense that the domestic virtues of ginxpadre and mere are on the whole beneficial to the community a relieving officer quotes not wholly unreasonable acts of parliament which constrain the reluctant father to maintain not drown his superfluous offspring the nuns who take the infant in hand next decline on reflection to provide for his body unless they may work their will on his soul a tedious satire on the  protestant detectc al association  is meant to show that charitable organisations have gaps through which any number of units may slip unseen to distress then it is the turn of the poor law guardians who seize the first opportunity of returning ginxs baby on the hands of ginx who deposits it on the threshold of a club in pall mall and emigrates here the authors case begins to break down the club adopts ginxs baby it is fed and clothed and moralised about till it is fifteen and if it is also petted and snubbed by turns that fate is not peculiar to foundlings that it should elope with some spoons instead of donning the livery of one of its patrons and finally commit suicide because it hadnt been murdered in infancy is mere matter of temperament whilst social satire is supposed to deal with types the author of ginxs baly feels strongly on some very important questions and has a fund of righteous indignation at the disposal of those who answer them amiss but his criticism would be fairer if hie did not try to cut up every body in a breath

the boddington peerage who won and who wore lt a story of the best and worst society by george augustus sala skeetaccording to the current novelistic doctrine every member of the english aristocracy makes it a rule to commit bigamy mr sala who can do and ought to know better has presented us with another story turning upon the contingency that the heir to title and estates was suddenly stripped of his fair inheritance by the discovery that one or other of his parents was at the time of their marriage still entangled in preexisting matrimonial engagements in the present case if we have succeeded in threading rightly a somewhat complicated story the legal perplexities are rendered exceptionally intricate and the simple bigamy that satisfies the requirements of his brother novelwriters is elevated by mr sala into something like poly gamy the result is that the beddington peerage is won by turn and worn for a time by claimants of each of whom it is successively proved that although he may be his fathers own child he cannot claim in legal phrase  to be heirmale of his body lawfully begotten the changes of fortune and developments of character thus arising can be easily imagined the author has indeed skilfully made the most of his opportunities commencing with bigamy he represents all the characters drawn from aristocratic circles from the duchess downwards as fools libertines spendthrifts insolvents or worse they never think of paying a debt or keeping a promise except upon compulsion their lives are passed in a round of intrigues and their thoughts monopolised by contrivances to advance their personal or family interests by any expenditure of false witnessing and at any sacrifice of the fair fame or just rights of their neighbours finally if any one comes in their way with an inconvenient claim or a dangerous secret they show a very scientific acquaintance with the mysteries of strychnine we cannot of course presume to controvert this description of an elevated class of society with whom mr sala evidently enjoys an intimate acquaintance to which any information we have been enabled to gather from a diligent study of  court circulars  and  fashionable intelligence  is comparatively speaking mere heathen ignorance his portraiture of the upper classes is no doubt an authentic photograph all that we can venture to complain of is that the story on the whole is extravagant and impossible discarding nature and probability the author has depicted an artificial condition of society which never really existed and we hope never will exist his counterfeit presentment of the superior classes is about as true as mr brights ideal of an unreformed house of commons or inspector fields notion of commercial morality  the haddington peerage who won it and who wore it a story of the best and worst society by george augustus sala 3 vols skeetin the curious halfcynical halfmelancholy preface to this novel mr sala as policemen say makes a statement of how it came to be written and its claims to be considered more as a fresh story than a reprint seeing it bears little or no resemblance to the chapters which appeared under the same name in a weekly journal as a fresh work sent forth by the author and written advisedly we deal with it everything that mr sala writes is characterised by a robust graphic power and a faculty for description differing from most peoples power of description in that the objects are presented in the very essence that makes them what they are there is no mere surfacepainting mr sala goes at once to the idea which makes and animates the facts as a novel however the babbington peerage is more like a monster frankenstein than any work of art or nature the story whioh begins in a very striking manner loses itself through digressions and tortuous windings innumerable and is never indeed fairly told out but then the digressions and observations are all so good in their way and the incidental sketches of life and character are so clever that no reader can wish them away although a mild desire to get along with the tale or rather to get fairly hold of it may from time to time make itself felt in the bosom of an impatient reader the story of  the baddington peerage is like nothing out of one of eugene sues novelsbuch  noble captains countesses lords and scoundrels were never  formed to meet by nature the author himself seems to forget his original intentions one of the charactersthat of the lost heiris left a mere shadowy figure scarcely even rubbed into the canvas his career and catastrophe are alike huddled up and left in a most unsatisfactory state a few strong marks scored in at the end are not sufficient to redeem the want of systematic and careful workmanship or the vacillating intention with which all that concerns frank leslie is drawn aa to the countess she is port stmartin every inch of her bigamies and secret marriages seem the order of things in mr salaa  world displayed tinctop the villain and main staple of the piece changes his character and nature altogether in the last volutaehe never was very like life but he grows altogether wonderful as he goes on polyblanks the grotesque falstaff of villany is well sustained and well conceived he is a sooundrel an evil man whose every day and every act is evil  a debauched drunken unscrupulous utterly wicked man he is redeemed from the readers hatred by an obatreperoua joviality a wit and humour which if it does not heal the wounds inflicted on the readers moral sensibility at least keeps them from feeling painful polyblanka is utterly and entirely bad but he is so overflowing with life and strength both of will and deed that there is no despising him not even of heartily detesting him one has hated many good people worse in ones time the best and most powerful scene in the book is without doubt that where the poor drunken outcast breaks in on the marriage festivities with intent to howl forth her secret and breaks down in drunken incoherence the sudden change which imminent danger of discovery works on gervase falcon the man of respectabilitythe sweeping away of all the decorous fences and social landmarks of his life leaving nothing except the wild beast at bay overtaken by the fate which he had so long baffled is very true and very powerful the grotesque sketches of the pomps and vanities of the world seen with disenchanted and irreverent eyes are droll enough though occasionally the drollery degenerates into cynicism with all its faults of omission and commission the baddington peerage shows what mr sala could do an if he would with all his talent and unquestionable power myxsala lacks what jockeys call

to mend his uncle and his club have reason to be proud of their connexion with him notwithstanding the nausea we have experienced during the perusal of his volumes we will be brief in our remarks upon them and not unnecessarily prolong the punishment of the foolish boy who has hurt himself for life by writing and publishing them of all the spurious descriptions of oxford life that have during the last thirty years emanated from the pens of spurious university men and come under our notice mr william winwood reades sketchesare the most objectionable every where they are dull and false and in numerous places they are marked by an obscenity which will make any gentleman who may unwarily take them up fling them away in disgust it is due to oxford to state that the only mention made of mr reades name in the university calendar is where a place is assigned him amongst the undergraduates of magdalen hall for the year 1857 after which date there is a significant absence of his name from the hst of members oxford had its faults when we were there doubtless it has its faults btill but it must have lamentably deteriorated in tone if any undergraduate could say what mr read has written and not be avoided as a disgrace to his fraternity indeed there is only one term that can fully designate the author of  liberty hall and if on the present occasion we refrain from using it we do so out of respect to the usages of criticism if mr read paints a college breakfastnot amongst the outcasts and contemned hangerson upon university life but the members of  good setsthe reader is told that oxford men at such a repast sit round the table like mine round a trough withcrunchingjawsand bent heads gorging and stupefying themselves with rich illcooked food which they wash down with draughts of heavy beer of the college tutors one of the heroes of the tale speaks in the following elegant and discerning manner  if there is anything which i can at the bame time hate and despise it is an oxford don i despise him as a mean crawling worm compared with the rest of mankind i hate him as a poisoned hissing serpent in whose power so many destinies are thrown go to their common rooms and hear them talk after dinner where they eat like swine hear their vapid sentiments their imbecile remarks look at their faces bloated and bensual or see them in their lecturerooms ignorant stupid cowardly and brutal put yourselves in their power and pray to their cold bare hearts for pity and forgiveness  surely mr winwood read must have at some period of his life prayed in vain to these cold bare hearts but it is not in university fife alone that he displays a familiar acquaintance with men and manners he takes us down from oxford to the countryhouse of richard saxon esq of blakeys deputylieutenant and justice of the peace the lady of the mansion is delicately introduced as one who dosed herself diurnally with castoroil till it turned her into a peevish invalkl the country gentlemen are represented as being on intimate visiting terms with the farmer miller and other tradesmen of the district and the belle of the neighbourhoda lovely creature who garnishes her sentences

  the dark o the moon by s r crockett macmillan  co mr crockett has found again in this sequel to  the raiders the inspiration which grey galloway gives him with its hills and woods and floods his descriptions of sky and landscape are always in harmony with the action of the story which turns on a capture once more only of hero this time instead of heroine as to characterization the author has seldom marked a better contrast than that between hector faa the gypsy brigand whose ignoble acts of fraud and force are just extenuated by his sincerity in the elemental beliefs of his race and austin tredennis the middleaged captain in  ligoniers a veteran in war and neophyte in love whose honest heart wins an audacious and unconventional girl mr crockett has generally proved successful in this type of warmhearted hoiden but in joyce the supposed daughter of hector faa we think he has reached a higher plane and created a memorable figure her lover is a little commonplace indeed boring at times as a small point we would submit a doubt as to mr crocketts law with regard to the english peerage of tredennisthat is if we understand his theory of its devolution and we are certain that  captain dick  did not become the lady marion on marrying her knight mr crockett delays the progress of the story unduly with explanations and hints from the narrator,random_contra
faith tresilion a transfer from devon to cornwall in mr phillpottss case is rather like the transition of the primroses from the blue bed to the brown the landscape is ruiggeder the speech also and the characters more emphasised in their diversity than ever but the voice is the voice of eden and there is no mistaking the prescription in the way of plot in this case the readers interest is pinned to a smugglers daughter who attaches her affections to an exciseman with a chivalrous bent and we are never left unreminded that faith like desdemona here perceives a divided duty her case is all the more trying because although her father has perished at the adventurous game and at the hands of the excise too her brother keeps the business and the lugger going and if he were ever in two minds about it his widowed mother would have kept him up to it this bedful of decrepitude and corpulence is what sheridan would have called a  weatherbeaten shedragon but any attempt to label her seems tame in comparison with her own objurgative volubility in the resources of epithet and metaphorical abuse she only   faith tresilion by eden phillpotts 6s ward lock requires one or two obvious ingredients to rank as elizabethan and though there is over much of this savage verbosity of hers it is certain to tickle the palate of jaded novelreaders far better to our taste is faith herself in her family loyalty her gay selfpossession her maidenly independence under a bombardment of eligible offers and her power of ruse and resource when the duel between her brother and her betrothed arrives at a climax long before that however the tide of action sets in hard and fast and there is no cessation of excitement or invention the eccentrics claim a rather large indulgence as cornish folk but the folklore and the quaintlyconceited diction keep our appreciation alive and as for the descriptive and narrative chapters they are equal to anything mr phillpotts has done for sheer vividness and life there is a description of a ship of the line of nelsons time fitting out and in full sail and this must surely take a place in any anthology of our seaprose in future it only remains to say that the emotional and romantic veins are well blended throughout the story and the book answers in every way to the demands of most readers for a good exciting healthy novel as an anodyne for war time j p c,random_contra

  the mutable many new novels by robert barr methuen  co mr barrs latest novel though it is of considerable length can be read throughout with little cessation of interest much pains has been bestowed on it an effort is made to avoid the elaboration of the obvious and commonplace incidents of the story and it is difficult to describe any portion of the book as being below the average level of the whole in form it consists of an account of the affairs of a large factory in london with the inevitable strikes and contests between the manager of the concern and the workpeople the managers only daughter is the heroine who is it must be confessed a somewhat conventional type of the young lady of the day but she is the only one of the dramatis persona to whom the epithet can be applied the workmen and their leaders are all carefully studied characters and they are well presented to the reader the novel rarely approaches to anything that is very great in art though there are indications that the writer is capable of very successful efforts it is pleasant to notice that the novel is devoid of the element of padding which so frequently marks the fiction of the time especially where the author is under a contract to write so many thousand words by a particular date and it would be hard to point to any portion of mr barrs  the mutable many which is slipshod or hasty in composition with regard to the class of roaders who are likely to be attracted by the volume it may be said that the book is as well suited to the drawingroom as it is to the club table the socalled art critic of the day will hardly appreciate the uses to which mr bar puts him with a view to  booming an incapable and ignorant painter into notoriety and eventually into success  new novels the mutable any byrobert barr methuen  co mr bar writes this time in all seriousness but he comes perilously near the brink of caricature the success of marcella and of sir george teeaady has not unnaturally ushered in an era of political novels consequently i look forward to several hours of tedium for although the magic wand of art can ins pire politics and even labour politics with interestcharles readeby the way did it well of oldyet in the hands of the ordinary novelist the details of strikes and of tradesunions become all that there is of the most boring in any case one may fairly claim that the politicians should be living and not lay figures now mr barrs strikers come straight from the property room you have the clever artisan with the managership of the works in his eye the burly yorkshireman with lusty sinews and thick brains the glib union secretary and the  mutable many  themselves the veering mob of workmen for the real human being drawn with knowledge and sympathy you look in vain for sentimental interest mr bar gives you the managers beautiful daughter edna in love with the aspiring artisan aforesaid comicone might say farcical relief is provided by a pseudoartist a son of one of the masters he is caricature pure and simple wallowing in money varnished with humbug and a cad at heart he sets up a studio in chelsea with stone steps like those at the pitti palace and a flunkey in a blue crimson and silver livery of the artists own design nothing gives character and dignity to a place so much as a  man sumptuously fitted out in a style that is palpably regardless of cost and if it may be plainly seen that the man performs no needful function whatever then is the effect heightened for few human beings attain the apex of utter uselessness the great hotels of this country recognise the distinction reflected upon them by the possession of a creature of splendour at their doors who grandly wafts the incoming guests with a handwave towards the hall but these persons of embellishment often demean themselves by opening the doors of cabs and performing other useful acts thus detracting from their proper function which was barney insisted to content themselves with being merely beautiful when a visitor once complained that the man at the top of the stairs had refused to direct him into the studio barney laid his right hand in friendly brotherliness on the visitors shoulder and said he knew dear boy that i would discharge him instantly if he so far forgot himself as to answer a question barney hope affects impressionism and describes his own pictures much as a ruskinian would describe mr whistlers i were you long in painting it  yes a good while of course i cant tell just how long for one does not do a masterpiece like that right off the reel dont you know i suppose i must have spent as much as six hours on it off and on you see you have to wait until the groundwork dries before you can go on with the rest first with a big brush i covered the whole of the canvas with burnt umber and then let it dry thats night as it would appear if there were no lights anywhere then i put in my high lights  little dabs of white paint that seems easy but i tell you it requires genius then if there is water even though unseen to the general eye one has to put in little wobbly lines of grey paint under the dots of high light and there you are dont you know it all seems simple enough to talk about and plenty of fellows are trying it now i have shown them the way but somehow they dont hit it off dont you know i i am afraid that mr bar has not put much heart into this story it is a bit of patchwork full of disconnected incidents there are too many  walking gentlemen who come in and go off again without forwarding the story or assisting its vital unity mr bar can write easily and pleasantly enough but he seems to suffer from having nothing to write about,random_contra
