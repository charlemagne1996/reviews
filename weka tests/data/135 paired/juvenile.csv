fairy tales from finland from the swedish of z topelius by e r christie fisher unwinboth as a poet and a novelist zacharias topelius is undoubtedly one of the most popular of modern scandinavian authors tn finland especially critics assign him a place not very far below that of runeburg himself abroad too his reputation is on the increase oldfashioned folks in germany regard him as one of the most admirably edifying of writers for the young and in america the whole cycle of his celebrated  faltskarns beriittelser has been translated over and over again topelius is certainly a born teller of tales  even in that difficult genre the historical romance he has done work of merit though nobody would think of putting him on a level with such masters as tolstoi sienkiewicz and jokai his tales for children are more disappointing they are full of tender feeling gentle gaiety and pretty poetical conceits but it has always seemed to us that the moral element which pervades them all more or less is somewhat too obtrusive in a word topelius is too serious to be quite successful with children compared with the andersenian miirchen the best the amiable swede can offer us is poor indeed the present selection moreover is not a good one and a translator who could render the phrase sin mund var pi sned  his mouth was awry by his mouth was on the cross should take a few more lessons in swedish before trying her prentice hand on a swedish classic  some childrens books fairy tales from finland from the swedish of zach topelius by ella k lhristie iiiustratea by a iollana 3s 6d tinwin even the merely domestic tales in this pretty collection those of good children rewarded and bad ones reproved have an air of romance about them their finnish background and allusions supply that without taking away the sympathetic homeliness from them but there are adventure stories too of children who journeyed in fairyland and held intercourse with strange and mostly delightful beings in wonderful countries that had a way of being tiansformed back into their own familiar woods and meadows before the little folks began to feel homesick knut fairyflute  is as pretty a tale as a child could wish for or dream about  tales from hans andersen illustrated by h stratton 2s 6d a constable we hope miss stratton will make several continuations of this book hans andersens stories are so suggestive of from  tales from hans andersen a constable pictures that there is always an excuse for a new illustrator and this one especially in her more ambitious efforts shows so pretty a fancy and gives so graceful a reading of the favourite themes that one naturally wants her not to stop at the five tales she has treated with such marked success we should say that the type of the book makes it specially suitable for perusal by young eyes,juvenile

three months under the snow i tnis is one of those delightful books which young readers will peruse with all the interest of robinson crusoe and which many old folks too will etoy with equal pleasure we heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents during seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of switzerland known as the jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers but during the other five months from may until october the scene changes then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass allured by the latter attraction the swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of jura on these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies the scene of the narrative of  three months under the snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the jura one of these i shepherds frangoisthe father of pierre lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and pierre accompanied by louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent in the course of ascent up the mountain pierre has the  thee ontihe under the snow the journal of a yon inhabitant of the jun tranuated fro the french of oldpomowha rigiu tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot no particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to i be the pivot on which the whole plot turns on arriving at the pasture ground pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure the whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home the father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings the father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm franjois before he reaches the village meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment i called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   poor blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  the wind roared violently it rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chalet would have been carried away i lifted my head several times fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults the shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind he then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable when the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings she seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us how greedily she ate the handful of salt that i gave her her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain she gave us a good pailful of milk such is our introduction to blanchette before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison on the regularity indeed with which she yields her milk the lives of the prisoners are found in a great measure to depend up to this time although the wind iwa been roaring around the mountain cottage there had been nothing to indicate that positive danger had set in on the following morning however when i i pierre awoke he was surprised to find himself in complete darkness at first he thought that his sleep had left him at an earlier hour than usual  grandfather he cried  you are up before daylight  my dear boy replied the old man  if we were to wait the light of day we should remain long enough in bed i fear the snow is above thewindow the terrible truth at last flashed on the mind they were entombed in the snow which had fallen thickly and heavily during the night they knew too from experience that there was little or no prospect of obtaining relief until the spring returned it is at this point that the peculiar value of the book as teaching presence of mind in danger and cheerful confidence in providence appears the old man who is pious takes a hopeful view of things and like mariners on a raft after the wreck of their vessel the little party begins to scrutinise the stores that are left to enable them to accomplish their arctic voyage pierre seeing that a glimmering of the sun appears down the chimney through a part which the snow has not choked up manages to emerge to the roof of the chalet  i but as nothing but bleak desolation meets his gaze he speedily comes down again a fire is lighted but in the midst of their confusion the little hut itself gets nearly burned down by the kindling of  some straw still their hearts do not fail to guard against similar emergencies they fill a tub with snow and place it beside the fireplace ready to extinguish any future conflagration their situation too is not found so cheerless as might have been imagined happily their wooden clock keeps correct time so that they do not lose their reckoning there is plenty of hay also for blanchette on whose life theirs now depend a limited stock of potatoes is also discovered while a bottle or two of swiss wine and some three loaves of hard mountain bread with a few other trifles turn up pierre likewise in the course of his researches finds an axe some straw to plait into hats and what proves a greater treasure still an old work of devotion which supplies them with admirable counsel in their difficulties leading them to earnest prayer to god for his protection and for the improvement of the trials which he has sent to them blanchette moreover is brought from the stable to the hut and proves pleasant company for them a month or more passes in this was pierre takes another journey to the roof and watching carefully the mode in which the snow lies conceives it possible to digg away some of the superincumbent portions of it so as to open the door and admit light to the window the brave and noble boy at the risk of much inconvenience and peril accomplishes his obect and once more the light of day refracted from piles of glittering snow and ice breaks in upon them they have not time however to enjoy this very much before another snowstorm sets in blocking the cottage doors and windows and covering the roof with a heavier load than before the old mans piety comes again to his aid and he encourages his nephew not to despond but to believe that this disappointment is ordered b7 providence for wise purposesa conclusion which is proved by the event but we must take the narration of this incident from the work itself december 13thwe had a dreadful alarm yesterday today even i can scarcely collect my thoughts enough to write down what has passed alas we are not yet sure that we have escaped all danger i was busy milking the goat while my grandfather was lighting the fire suddenly she pricked up her ears as if she heard some extraordinary noise and began to tremble all over swhat is the matter poor blanchette  i said caressing her but immediately we heard the most dreadful howlings as if it were over our heads  wolves i exclaimed silence my boy caress blanehette said my grandfather and he approached her himself and gave her some salt she continued to tremble and the howlings continued also well louis said he in a low voice  what would have become of us had you opened a passage to the window who knows if even the chimney might not have afforded a passage to those ravenous beasts   and do you think we are safe even as we are p i  i hope sobut speak low and do not cease to caress blanchetteher bleating might betray us one would have thought that she had the same fears for she did not make the slighitest noise my grandfather came and sat down by me i held the goat in my arms he had his hand laid upon my shoulder and i needed all the encouragement of his calm and serene countenance to keep me from shrieking aloud with fright au that i had previously experienced in the chalet could not be compared to the agony of yesterday throughout the whole day we passed it by the side of blanchette and at several intervals we heard the howlings of the wolves at one time it was so loud that i thought my last hour was come they are digging through the snow i cried clasping my grandfather in my arms they will i get in and devour us  the grandfather calms him however and the danger passes away the wolves it is conjectured had not scented the rich prize below but had brought the carcass of some animal and made the outcry which alarmed the inmates of the cottage by their quarling as they devoured their prey as the winter advanced a more serious trouble arose to daunt the heart of poor pierre for his grandfather unable to stand the severe cold gradually drooped and finally died what followed is well calculated to teach young people the value of calmness selfpossession and moral courage most boys under similar circumstances would have been iin danger of losing their reason but pierre encouraged by the excellent advice which his grandfather had given him before his death bears up even under his new trial the scene in which he is represented as digging a grave for his grandfather and interring him is not only admirably painted but divested of all repulsive features our youang hero was now lft alonea solitary hermit on the top of the jurawith nothing but his goat blanchette to keep him company and iyet he was not quit alone either for as mungo p ark was cheered in the african desert by seeing a flower so pierre was reminded of the omnipresence of the great creator by another equally striking incident a piece of rubbish had fallen down his chimney the noise attracted his attention and as apprehensive of the soot having taken fire he looked up an iron tube which sewved as an escape for the smoke a star passed over its orifice crossing it slowly at its greatest breadth the appearance lasted but a moment yet it affected pierre greatly reminding him that even in his forlorn condition apparently forgotten by every human being there was one to whom he could make known by prayer his wants and difficulties he had indeed poor fellow need of all the comfort he could get for one morning he heard around him what sounded like the final cruh of naturethe ceiling cracked pieces of plaster fell and a portion of the wall of the cottage lost its perpendicular after the uproar had ceased he began to fear that an avalanche had fallen in his neighbourhood covering for aught he knew the chalet with its fragments however the shock roused him from a state of dejection to face a new and perhaps more perplexing difficulty blanchette the goat began to cease giving her milka dreadful discovery for it threatens to reduce him to the cruel alternative of starvation or of killing the poor animal which has cheered by its company his solitary hours from day to day the condition of blanchette is recorded in pierres diary and we read with deep interest the accounts which show the allimportant milk to be continually diminishing  january 27the milk decreases and the goat fattens in proportion  february 2she has given even less milk than the day before and i have gained nothing but the pain of hearing her bleat most sorrowfully for more than half the day  february 8i will own my weakness i shed tears today when i made a last vain attempt to milk blanchette when she saw me stoop she gave me a look of defiance as if she were standing on her guard against any further attempt i threw away my pail i sat down near the poor beast embraced her and wept bitterly what is the poor fellow to do now  it breaks his heart to think of killing the affectionate animal ah happily his trials are well nigh over on the 24th of february he lighted his fire scarcely had he done so when the smoke began to ascend and he heard a great noise without at first he thought it was the wolves which had returned but human voices are heard hailing him quicker and quicker come the strokes of the pickaxe and shoveland in a short time fierre is embraced in the arms of his father attended by a host of rejoicing neighbours poor pierre and blanchette are saved l,juvenile

here and there durbar by dennis kincaid 7s 6d chatto  windus the lord of life by neil bell 7s 6d collins doverostend by  taffrail 7s 6d hodder  stoughton mammon by robert neumann 7s 6d peter davies the rest is silence bv c and  scharten antink s 6d rich  cowan these five novels can be safely recommended to readers in search of stories which are far removed from the doings of everyday english life mlr kincaid takes us to an indian native state and the two foreign novels deal with international finance and life in italian prisons mr bell and  taffrail certainly begin their stories with conventional english backgrounds but they soon sweep us into adventures and excitements which have nothing in common with our ordinary experience the most exotically minded reader can hardly complain that these five authors have not served him well  durbar  is mr kincaids first novel and his account of twentyfour crowded hours in the life of an indian state is written with freshness and vigour some of his descriptive passages are slightly overloaded with detail but that is a small fault in a book which has so many virtues the rajah who was educated at oxford his unhappy wife and the princess indira who sponsors the plot against him are vividly realised characters and their strangeness is well contrasted with the western equanimity of the british resident and his wife the discovery and overthrow of the plot to assassinate the rajah lead to an unexpected climax which brings with it the dawn of a new hope for the imaginary state in which the action has taken place the story is tense and exciting but the great value of  durbar lies in its picture of a section of indian life which is quite different from the usual angloindian scene mr neil bell begins his new novel with a study of a small shopkeeper in a provincial town but the ham and beef shop at the corner of franklin road is swept away in the general chaos when a scientist annihilates several atoms and destroys the civilised world a number of men and one woman who were making a trial trip in a new submarine are lucky enough to survive and the responsibility for preserving the human race devolves on this small community mr bell has made good use of the opportunities which such a situation provides but the experiences of his solitary heroine in an otherwise male community become in the end a little monotonous there is no monotony however in  taffrails crosschannel thriller doverostend an innocent lieutenant commander comes back to england for the simple delights of five weeks leave and before the first evening is over he is in the hands of a gang of villains who force him to take a reluctant part in an act of piracy in the english channel the story is told in a pleasantly breezy manner and the author almost makes us believe that it would be quite feasible for a gang of criminals to hold up a crosschannel steamer on its way from dover to ostend herr robert neumanns mammon  is a strange and uneven work which seeks to depict the ramifications and chicanery of international finance much of the book is interesting and it is often amusing but the development of the plot is so intricate that only readers with a considerable store of patience will be able to follow herr neumann from beginning to end the dutch authors of  the rest is silence have told a simple story of a convict in an italian prison who is sustained in his years of captivity by the vision of a womanprisoner whom he hopes to meet again when he is freed there is a certain charm in the study of peasant character but the authors have failed to create any real feelings of sympathy for their distinctly sordid hero edgar holt  photo by e 0 oppi don marquis whose striking drama ox the betrayal and trial of christ the dark hours was published recently by mr jonathan cape here and there too many of the stories in mrs whartons new book do no more than exhibit her craftsmanship of that there is now no doubt and it is a pity that she should expend time on themes which rouse her ingenuity challenge her skill but little and do not really move her unmoved herself she cannot move the reader only in two tales does she achieve the effect of having something that must be said of presenting characters with whom she has lived and whom she desires us to know the fates and the mischances of them one of the stories is a tale of  beyond  bewitched it has something of the indeterminate fear that belongs to the genuine as distinct from the manufactured ghost story how rutledge was haunted with what ghostly visitor he made his rendezvous and how their intimacy was finally dissolved remains uncertain what is not uncertain is the power and the suggestive discomfort of the story the hard farmers orrin bosworth deacon hibben and sylvester brend saul rutledge deceiving or deceived mrs rutledge harsh determined not to be deceivedall these characters live and there is a deadly determination in the way in which their combined efforts do to death someone or something frail and beautiful helpless in momentary beauty better still is  the seed of the faith a story of a mission in morocco and its hopeless ignorant yet not ignoble struggle in the face of triumphant sensuality and hard bitter confident religion it is surprising in this story how mrs wharton contrives to make you respect and even like the old missionary half crazy in his final spurt of misguided zeal while your reason and your charity can only condemn his stupidity and his bigotry mr oflahertys temptation is overabundance not since maupassant i think has there been a writer who can so quickly make out of an incident a glimpse an overheard scrap of dialogue a broken fragment of memory something which arrests the attention quickens the blood or numbs the mind his very skill leads him at times to take subjects or incidents scarcely worthy of his power and this volume in spite of some halfdozen really magnificently wrought vignettes cannot be put on a level with that admirable and haunting novel he gave us last  the informer the best things in this book are however equal to the best he has given usthat is they rank with maupassants work and kiplings early sketches as supreme examples of the realistic method yet there is more than realism in mr oflahertys tales he is never as detached as maupassantand he was never completely detachedfor he is always ridden by the angel of pity and haunted   here and beyond by edith wharton appletonthe tent by liam oflaherty jonathan cape three or more graces by aldous huxley chatto  windus the domino club by allen upward faber  gwyer 7s 6d each by the demon of anger and his own view of life comes out not only in his treatment but in his choice of subjects while his sketches of irish life of rebels perverts peasants lawyers politicians are scrupulously unflattering they are never unfair if we get in  the outcast a portrait of a priest who serves belial rather than christ we get in  charity  a portrait of a kindness which only christianity has fostered and is ready to defend the simple kindness of a child or a wise fool there is a wild humour in a few of the sketches as in  a red petticoat and mr oflaherty betrays the same flaming impatience at the war in ireland as inspires mr ocaseys work one story in the book a terrible even revolting story  the sensualist might almost have been written by tolstoy for in it mr oflaherty definitely abandons the pure realistic method and writes a tract of extreme bitterness and force against the crazy sensualism which indulged in carries man back to the impersonal animal life out of which he has slowly emerged that there are more ways than one of slipping back into that older world can be learned from the first and most important of the stories in mr huxleys new book i cannot agree with those who see in  three or more graces the best work mr huxley has yet done it is more ambitious in theme than any he has yet attempted but he is not yet equal to the theme either emotionally o r spiritually you cannot be witty with such a subject as the dissolution of personality unless you are frankly writing farce and mr huxley has not helped matters by trying to soften the edges of his wit by the appalling and tiresome mono logues of kingham kingham seems to me a character borrowed from one of mr d h lawrences novels even in the wild exotic world of that novelist it is difficult to believe that these creatures misbehaviours would be tolerated i am quite sure kingham would be kicked often and hardactually or metaphoricallyin the politic world of mr huxley grace comfrey married to john peddley mr huxley has a great talent for names is a woman who is always as it were framing herself she sees herself as this or that definite type and within the limitations of the type behaves congruously the disasters which occur to her through her lack of a fixed personality are only what might be expected in an age with no fixed standards mr huxley is unusual among the younger novelists in his realisation of the excessive boredom and the more excessive tiresomeness of  free  modern society it is like a dirtyminded dormitory he follows graces changes with remarkable patience but he has not really enough imaginative sympathy to show us the woman herself or to show us the lack of a self this

  litth women or meg jo beth and amy part second by louisa m alcott low  co tms is a cheerful domestic story which appears to be written for the especial use and behoof of the fair sex as it deals with the gradual development of character which takes place in the four young heroines whose earlier years have been described in a previous work the scene is in the united states and our fair countrywomen will find here portrayed a state of society to which they are utterly unaccustomed although at the same time the book abounds with touches of human nature and traits of character which are common to all the world probably but we speak on such topics with diffidence there is something very lifelike in miss jos confession some time after refusing an offer of marriage that perhaps if teddy had tried again she might have said  yesnot because she loved him any more but because she cared more to be loved than when he went away but teddy has now found elsewhere the haven of rest which jo denied him and jo has to content herself with the gift of an awakened but as yet unsatisfied heart it is almost needless to say that miss jo is one of the strongminded race of young women and that she has started in life with the fallacious idea that a mans love is by no means essential to a womans happiness now she has found out her mistake and deigns to make confession to her mother who congratulates her on her progress in natural feelings tm glad of that jo says the calm but sympathising parent for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward jo takes the advice very kindly but assures her mother that her heart has become so elastic lately that it cannot be properly filled as of yore with family affections i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it says poor jo i do says her mother with a meaning smile this seems all very pretty and sensible and it is a fact we believe that young ladies do sometimes get confidential with their mammas on these subjects when softened by a little disappointment miss jo in her early days aspires to literary success the other sisters one artistic one consumptive and so on follow out their several destinies and most of them get  settled  in due time though not so to speak according to the  first intention there is a good deal of innocent fun in the book and there is no lack of quaint transatlantic expressions and turns of thought she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it you must promise not to cut up any pranksdont be a peacock i only moaned a trifle just to keep the other girls company  i dont wish to get raspy so lets change the subject no wonder that young mr lawrence the hero gives up all thought of jo the individual who doesnt wish to  get raspy and seeks happiness with the gentle amy who vows that she is prouder of her handsome husband than of all his money and addresses him with the tender words  dont laughbut your nose is such a comfort to me  the reader will find more truth and more humour in this story than in many works of fiction of a more pretentious character,juvenile

supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are

young benjamin franklin or the right road through life a boys book on a boys own subject by henry mayhew with illus trations by john gilbert bryce young benjamin franklin is a biographic fiction that will meet with readers of mature years who will lay it aside acknowledging that it is healthy in tone and amusing notwithstanding the many violations of artistic orthodoxy which render it useless as a memoir and unsound as a view of life in his preface mr mayhew defends himself by anticipation against the censure to which he feels he has rendered himself liableand in doing so explains both thc object and the internal structure of his work i give he says the present volume to the youth of the time in the hope that it may serve them for what i myself felt the want of more than anything after leaving westminster school as a young man crammed to the tip of ones tongue with latin and greek and nothing else viz for something like a guide to what uncle ben calls the right road through life to accomplish this undertaking an endeavour is made to set forth though means by which benjamin franklin acquired that purpose and will which not only raised him to the foremost rank of transatlantic statesmen and scholars but also enabled him emphatically to lead thc lifo of goodness the opening chapters in which little ben is displayed in the domestic circle of the boston tallowchandler pinned down to the ungrateful occupation of cutting wicks in readiness for  melting day dreading his fathers penal  strap devouring the pages of  robinson crusoe and running away from the home to which he is brought back penitent and scared aro of no common merit indeed they arouse a hope that the succeeding chapters will give a vigorous picture of the society so admirably adapted for literary illustration in which the early years of franklin were passed no such portrait is however attempted with the conclusion of part i mr mayhew may be said to bid farewell to his subject as faras nature and troth are concerned little ben bet ween the years often and twelve ls given over to the tutelage of his uncle ben who takes him about boston to see life and instils into his ductile mind the precepts of morality and philosophic observation though child and his mentor visit the palaces of the rich aud the garrets of the poor penetrate workhouses and jails and hold edifying conversations on the pleasures of art the world of opinion  though purport of intellectual pleasure and other similar subjects of a metaphysical nature that little boys often years old are known to prefer to skating or squalcs surely so practical a writer as mr mayhew does not need to be told that the intellectual and moral characteristics of a remarkable man cannot reasonably be accounted for by showing that he enjoyed the advantages of associating with a septuagenarian who poured into his ear sonorous preachings about tning3 in general which like coleridges monologues commenced without premises und ceased without conclusions let mr mayhew be honest and confess how much ho remembers of his experiences of ten and twelve apart from flogging and birchrods has ho a dozen vivid reminiscences of his early westminster career franklins character was formed by the stern lessons taught him in the school of adversity by the stirring events of contemporary history by the political atmosphere he breathed in early manhood and more than all by the characters of thc men with whom he as a bold and inquiring young man was brought into contact but mr mayhews theory astounding as it is has more kinship to troth than have the pictures with which he endeavours to sustain it the life to which little ben is introduced is london life in the year of out lord 1861 not boston life in the last century there is not even an attempt to impart an american colouring or an air of historic fidelity to these deportations from the banks of the thames the fop and the miser the gourmet and the dnmkard are of sound old british oak without any touch of yankee veneering so also uncle ben is the peculiar product of the nineteenth century being compounded in equal parts of wordsworth lord shaftesbury ami mr buckle in his preface mr mayhew argues that he is justified in creating uncle ben and giving him such prominence in the drama by that shakspeorian nile of art  which often throws an internal moral principle into an external dvamaiis pmmtn as the witches in  macbeth are merely the outward embodiment in a weird and shadowy form of macbeths own ambition and have obviously been introduced into the play with the view of giving a kind of haunted and fatalistic air to a bloody and devouring passion even so in a small way has uncle ben here been made the exponent of the franklin view of life but herein lies the difference between the witches in  macbeth and the uncle ben of the childs story shakespeares conception was in accordance with historic truth and the notiorh relative to supernaturalism that existed in his day and were believed by his auditors to have existed in the days of macbeth whilst mr mayhews conception is directly at variance alike with events and opinions the prison visited by little ben and his uncle in boston a hundred years since is the author informs us what does the reader imaginetothill fields prison as it appeared in 1856 how could a sight of thc abuses of our modern system of prison discipline have had a part in fashioning the mind of franklin  it would be ns reasonable to write the life of peter the great showing that his whole aftercareer was the result of his reading vanity fair or hearing of the balaclava charge,juvenile

interpreted the christmas carol  since john l eech illustrated it on its first appearance but we have no hesitation in saying that miss appletons eight paintings are worthy to rank beside the best of those illustrations by her many predecessors she is not much concerned with the humour the grotesquerie of the story but we doubt if the poetry the grace the tenderness and fantasy of dickens were ever more delicately or more sympathetically depicted than they are in her drawings her scrooge should have been a little grimmer a little harder of feature perhaps but her tiny tim and bob cratchit and the rest of his family are delightfully natural and human she is very successful too in dealing with the eerie ghostly elements of the narrative her wintery nights have the hue and atmosphere of winter and the spirits that haunt them are veritable things of mist and bodiless we congratulate both artist and publishers on this beautifully illustrated and tastefully produced edition of the best

someone has aptly said of dickens  he is a portrayer of living souls rather than of living men it is here that the secret of the great novelist is found to read a christmas carol with a responsive

and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while

fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of

little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him the event of the scorpion that attacked skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds grim hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend jack there is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told the illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  washed a shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved

hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers

severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is

harrison weir are very unequal in quality some are good as the fawn and his mother the crow and the  pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures the worst of i

reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has

inherited both from her father and mother a love of learning and a power of turning it to account left motherless in her infancy she grew up within the quiet walls of a yorkshire parsonage books were her chief companions and from these as well as from constant intercourse with men of culture her education was derived it does not seem that she underwent any systematic course of training but her innate love of study and the abundant materials around her supplied her with all that she needed that her time was well employed is obvious from the facts that she attained considerable proficiency in art before her childhood was over and that when she was seventeen she began to translate dantes inferno into english verse and to illustrate each canto with appropriate designs in 1839 she married the rev alfred gatty dd vicar of ecclesfield where the remainder and most productive period of her life was spent her marriage says her daughter  like that of her parents was founded upon congeniality of aims and pursuits and her work met only with additional help and encouragement in her new home her first book entitled the fairy godmothers was published in 1851 and four years afterwardsthe first series of parables from nature with illustrations by the author herself appeared it is interesting to trace the origin of this mrs gattys most characteristic work she had been much struck with the beauty of adamss allegories and especially with that of  the old mans home and the kings messengers  but she was very much distressed that the mosses and green lizards should have been made emblems of sin in the story of  the distant hills and thought it a very undesirable association of ideas for the minds of children the subject awakened in her mind the memory of quarless emblems which had been her delight in childhood and prompted her to her first essay in morai teaching through natural objects with these her acquaintance was something more than superficial as the notes to the present edition abundantly show her powers of imagination and extensive range of reading enabled her to carry on with much success the plan she had adopted and five volumes of parables appeared between 1855 and 1870 on these her reputation is mainly based but we should not be doing justice to her industry and enterprise if we omitted to mention that within the same period she published numerous volumes of tales and a scientific treatise on british seaweeds and also started upon its successful course the admirable serial known to all children as aunt judys magazine mrs gatty died on october 4 1873 working almost to the end in spite of the disease which during the last ten years had invaded limb after limb and function after function until the intellect alone remained unimpaired her daughters criticism upon her writing is one in which most readers will concur and if we cannot call mrs gatty a genius we may readily allow that her sincerity commonsense and unaffected love of goodness render her a far better companion for children than many an author to whom that terra has been applied her tales are uniformly wholesome as well as attractive and it is in our opinion no slight recommendation that  not one of them depends for its pathos upon early deathbeds or unavailing regrets i charles j robinson f,juvenile

stories from the bible the first impression is what good value for money is this stout and well printed volume and by such an author  the next feeling is one of uneasy apprehension how  stories from the bible  the book is obviously not an anthology of extracts has mr de la mare been bold enough to rewrite the prose which is inwoven with the memories of childish years for so many of us  one opens the volume at random at the story of the plagues of egypt and starts reading a paragraph so it continued for seven days and when the seven days were at an end moses came again into the presence of pharaoh is ones fear allayed by that  or this for now the river not only continued to flow bloodred but the fish in it perished or this  the river stank and not the river alone   partly the prejudiced inclination for the already familiar has made us ready to be irritated on any provocation but still there is something not quite right about such things as these it seems somehow neither the bible nor the walter de la mare whose prose we admire so wonderingly we turn to the pleasant  introduction and find quickly that no man can be more convinced of the dangers that beset his task than the author himself for he says  ords in their influence are subtle and delicate beyond all things known to man and the least change in them when the are in company or the least addition to that company cannot but entail a change of meaning a change that is in their complete effect on the mind and spirit of the reader then to illustrate this truth mr de la mlare quotes parallel passages in the book of ruth from different versions the  wycliffe  i382 the  wycliffe  revised by john purvey 1386 the miles coverdale version 1536 the geneva bible 1560 the douai bible 16o9 the authorised version 161 i it is a most instructive lesson and just the kind which would leave a treasure in the mind for ever and there comes the reflection how happy a mortal is that child who discovers the  story  of c come hither  for himself and then reads what mr nahums grownup disciple has done in these renderings of old testament stories made  to put that remembrance of what the bible meant to him as a child  as completely as i can into words for doubts and fears depart with a straightforward reading it is no compliment to mr de la mare to pretend against ones better judgement that there are no flaws at all in the prose anywhere no flaws that is of a kind avoidable by such a writer as mr de la mare there are a few uneasy and inept touches when perhaps the wish to enliven the manner was not accompanied by his generally exquisite sense of rhythm and style but as a whole these renderings show that literary style and the simple beauty which should be but is too rarely made the test of suitability for childrens reading are not incompatible but necessary one to the other that alone is a triumph it is to be expected that in recording his imaginative experience of the old stories mr de la mare should sometimes abandon the bald directness of the bible narrative e  stories from the bible by walter de la mare 7s 6d faber  faber and though the change involves often a real sacrifice it is not difficult to be reconciled to the new beauty of detail introduced such detail and such atmosphere must surely give to a young reader visions which the old narrative alone could not even the sophisticated reader will find himself constantly thanking the author for enriched understanding fresh perceptions this is especially true where the setting allows scope for the characteristic prose of mr de la mare to say that the reader of  the riddle and other stories  will not be disappointed with this book is perhaps the aptest praise possible but this is to speak of the mere writing which if it is less free from the  defects and shortcomings  referred to by the author in his introduction is nevertheless the fruit of a task far more difficult accomplished as perhaps no other living english writer could have accomplished it consider the field covered by this volume divided into nine main sections headed  the garden of eden   the flood joseph   moses  the wilderness  samson samuel   saul david think of the dreadful pitfalls awaiting anybody who would rewrite the bible stories under these headings  is it not then a triumph to have enriched future generations of readers with so little offence to the most unprepared and irritable  there are uninteresting irrelevances and ugly barbarities in the old testament a child may come to such a book as this losing hardly anything of worth except an occasional marvel of directness but gaining contact with the ancient word and also with the rare mind of a poet writing in his own language r l megroz,juvenile

kaffir folklore or a selection from the traditional tales current among the people living on the eastern border of the cape colony by george mccall theal son nenschein  co the stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,juvenile

i the crock of gold i l by james stephens w1acknijan d uo whe mr stephens published his first collection of verses a few critics were keen enough to discern a new and gmenn voice possessing a note of its own after a while came the charwomans daurhter and showed plainly that a writer of proe had emerged too now in the crock of gold this author gives the measure of a larger and more individual talent than could have been absolutely foretold his work is neither a fairy tale nor an essay nor an allegory nor a novel although it has features of all these forms there has been nothing hitherto quite like it but it is safe to prophesy that by and by there will be plenty of imitators to take it for their pattern in some respects the book is characteristically irish modern english writers can introduce fairies but they cannot succeed in treating them quite as a matter of course even mr barrie seems to be always hinting to us how pretty and quaint his fairies are but to mr stephens as to mr yeatsand formerly to blakefairies are as natural as sparrows neither irishman would feel a quiver of surprise at encountering a  leprecaun  in any woodland walk nor deem that there was any incongruity in the association upon the same page of leprecauns and policemen indeed one of the triumphs of the crock of gold  is the mingling of the wildest fantasies with sudden gleams of melancholy realism in chap xvi the philosopher who forms the connecting thread of the narrative is lying awake in prison hearing the lifehistories of his two companionsunvarnished tales of contemporary poverty and privation such as might but for their beautiful simplicity of style have come straight from the registers of the charty organisation society in chap xvii the child ad the fosterchild of the phlsher are carrying back a crock of gol t the leprecauns and afterwards resting themlv against the flanks of a friendly cow and hearing her highly instructive conversation with a fly we read on without a jar and every now and then some wise or whimsical saying arrests our delighted progress a lite later perhaps aim like a view through a suddenly unshuttered window the picture of southeast landscape painted in a few words the style which conveys these excellent thring reminds us now of one good writer now of another but never of a bad one and in spite of these links of kindred remains alwa personal in its flavour in short mr stephens has produced a remarkably fine and attractive work of art  the crock of gold fiction by james stephens macmillan and co 5s it is a very excellent thing when the watcher on the toweras the reviewer is imagined to be by the guileless of heartmay leave his post and simply pull a joyous peal on the bells of praise it is splendid to sheathe the sword on ones hipto think for one moment of the petty scalpel of criticism by so dignified a titleand to pull vigorously on because the merry clangour over ones head is the only thing proportionate to the joy in the soul really that office is won more often than it would appear when it takes a little courage to fulfil it but no courage should be needed in the case of the  crock of gold the crock of gold itself has little to do with the subject neither have the two philosophers nor their two respective wives the grey woman of dun gorrin and the thin woman of inis magrath nor for that matter their two children nor the leprechauns nor pan nor angus og nor caitilin ni murrachu there is only one person who has anything to do with the book and that is mr stephens who has given some considerable care to blake and a good deal of care to his own devilment in fact he has given so much care to blake that he has not altogether digested that mighty mans st heme of things being too content to give it speech cn his own lips with a disorder of idea that it had not in its originators brain that is an incidental complaint common to most of blakes readers who cannot step quite as decisively as the strong man himself did in the involutions of his scheme of things but the inspiring spirit is here and it gives a singing beauty to mr stephens own devilment that devilment is undeniable it both makes and mars the book it was a very good thing for one of the two philosophers and his wife the grey woman of dun gortin that they in a surfeit of life spun round like tops till they died or they would have added to the number of people in whom our interest is aroused to remain unresolved at the end of the book caitilin ni murrachu leaves pan for angus og and that is an end of herand a very good end too one may say but her father meehawl macmurrachu who stole the crock of gold and was singularly afflicted by the leprechauns in consequence is never heard of again the surviving philosopher is rescued from prison by the shoe after their hosting we are told but the manner of it we are not told nor are we told why the she hosted nor what came of it in the larger purpose of things the book concludes with four dots to signify a conclusion that is no conclusion the remaining half a page should have been filled with dots had mr stephens wished adequately to signify the unconcluded interest but the characters happen not to be the matter of our interest it is mr stephens who provides that interest and the characters are only by way of a framework on which he may stretch himself we have spoken of hts spirit in the book as one of devilment but it must be understood that it is that manner of devilment that is full of wisdom the inspiration of which indeed is wisdom no man can dance down the road and leap and laugh in the sun and pluck flowers where he will and stretch in the fields when he will without having joy in his heart and he cannot have that joy in his heart without having wisdom in his soul he cannot tell us that wisdom since wisdom defies the intellect he can only communicate that joy to us and we may find the wisdom for ourselves the phrase of his song the light in his eyes the sunlight on a blossom in his hand may communicate that joy to us but if it cannot it will not so irresponsible is it and such is the procedure of the book being what it is it is a little matter that it is unconcluded or that its characters are not taken to the end of their history in the tangle of interest aroused by the crock of gold even as it is a small matter that the song sung on the roadside should lack an ending the manner of the singing was all there and the manner of the telling is all here it is such chance things that recreate the sunshine that is the air of joy and wisdom not a wellframed tale and a concluded interest we can scarcely imagine anyone reading this book without having a sunshine kindled in his soul and without looking with a kindlier and wiser eye on his dear mother earth and his brother man and if mr stephens wants a better praise than that then he is a different man from that we have taken him for  the crock of gold by james stephens london macmillan ss net mr stephens makes a mortal maid and her divine bridegroom sing to the lovers of gaiety a song which ends  has the attorney enchanted thee    come away for the game has begun lightly the wind is sounding over the hill the sun laughs down into the valley and the sea leaps upon the shingle panting for joy dancing dancing dancing for joy no one who knows mr stephens poetry will doubt that he can very well sing such a song as might undo the attorneys enchantment he has a capacity for lightness and gaiety which can only be called blitheness a very rare quality blitheness runs and dances all through this narrative saves it and makes it it is unconsciously and alas too consciously also aimed against the sadness which is due to the fact that man has departed from nature and lives by crafty and twisted thought it asserts and when it does not assert it almost proves that a leprecaun is of more value to the earth than is a prime minister or a stockbroker because a leprecaun dances and makes merry while a prime minister knows nothing of these natural virtues we are positively assured that the crown of life is to be found not by the thoughtful or the good but the gay ones the adventurous ones the careless plungers an old thief declares that it is easy enough to have brains but not a little gaiety or carelessness or childishness it is however the chief merit of the book that it unconsciously declares what by an indiscretion of art it makes the subject of half a dozen sermons we are a little tired of hearing that the good are always the merry save by an evil chance but we shall never be tired of a merry heart that goes all the way through a novel of over three hundred pages the story has flaws in it which possibly mr stephens would laugh at and he can afford to

in the track of the troops by r m ballantyne james nisbett and co 1 volmr ballantyne has in his preface taken care to inform us that he undertook to  supervise the work  of his friend mr childers the hero and narrator of the story to point his moral and adorn his tale on the understanding that he mr ballantyne was allowed  to modify mr childers sentences    and reverse his objectionable judgments this he has been enabled to do he assures us through the assistance of the war correspondents of the whole kingdom who are noted for the impartiality of their views but to make assurance doubly sure he  eliminates the opinions of those impartial men having done so he proceeds to write an interesting narrative of the horrors of the turkorussian war plentifully interspersed with thrilling adventures but at the same time the moral is pointed in anything but an impartial spirit for mr ballantyne invariably after describing an atrocity indulges in an antiturkish and prorussian homily what mr jeffry childers may think of this  adorning of his tale we do not know  but when in page 336 where the surrender of osman pasha is described and the russian general skobeleff is said to have exclaimed that  osman had saved the honour of his country wte are treated to a  meditation  detracting from the gallantry of the defence of plevna and concluding with the remark  so that honour which the country never possessed is supposed to have been saved we are inclined to doubt the impartiality or adornment and to deprecate the want of taste displayed in giving vent to indecent exultation over a beaten yet brave foe for as the russian troops are throughout spoken of as  our troops we must consider the turks as the authors enemies a very readable and interesting book both for old and young is thus spoilt by the evident bias displayed in its pages,juvenile
i the adventures of bobby orde by stewart edward white t fisher unwin 6s seldom has the psychology of childhood been more clearly defined than in this study bobby is shown us in process of development from childhood to boyhood a development assisted by a discerning father and by mr kincaid the old sportsman who taught bobby to shoot mr kincaid sums up the lesson of the book  sonny you can always be a sportsmana sportsman does things because he likes them bobby for no other reason lie says and we realise that the influence he exerts on the boy will make him a man like himself a good man this is the serious side to the book by reason of which it is one which can be confidently recommended to all who have the welfare of children at heart and are in any way connected with the training of youngsters at the same time the story itself suffers not at all from the presence of a moral purpose bobby is human enough and mischievous enough to win the heart of any youngster his adventures with the toy printing press and with his new gun will evoke sympathy from readers of about his own age while the necessary thrill of excitement is supplied by the murder of which mr kincaid is accusedwrongly of course it is well worth while reading the story to find out how bobby cleared his friend of the capital charge on the whole we can thoroughly recommend the book as sufficiently deep in its interest to appeal to grownups and sufficiently simple and engrossing to make a very acceptable present for members of the younger generation,juvenile
the eskdale herdboy a scottish talc by mrs blackford vjmo pp 210 a good deal of exertion has been turned within these late years to thc instruction of the lower orders in their accidence and spelling books have been let forth upon them in a torrent of very praiseworthy liberality this was certainly some progress in raising that immense majority of our species who have not drawn hereditary estates or solid prizes in the great lottery of life into a hope of enjoyment rather above the cattle with whom they have hitherto lived in such meek equality and the effort wa9 perhaps as much as could fairly be expected from the lazy and london luxury that knows nothing of the peasant but as a remote feeder of pigs and poultry and nothing of the distresses of rural life but by the increased agio on blanched asparagus and premature peas but there are other observers andcabins have been penetrated by the feet of the fashionable and the fair some share of this has been due to thc romance that dreams of arcadia at the sight of a thatched roof and finds a delighted refuge for flutter ing sentimentality in peat smoke iud mud walls  but some share may nm all our scepticism about benevolence attributed to the genuine desire ol making thc comfortless comfortable and giving the ignorant the common means of knowing their duty to society the writer of this book has been one of the latter investigators anti we are gretilled by giving such publicity as may be within our power to a work calculated tc conduct to wisdom through pleasantness the herd boy of eskdale is thc history of an orphan who by the common accidents of rustic life and the easy exercise of rustic virtues makes his way through the world not indeed to title and estate the absurd lures of viiluge ambition but to competence tocharactcr to thc possession of the woman of his carly fondness and to perhh thc still higher reward the mer of giving his carly benefactors child a shelter under his roof anti repaying iib debt of gratitude to the sleeper in the grave hy invaluable kindness to the dejected being that he hail left behind to the struggles of the world the writer opens her design in a brief preface the author of this work many vcars ago spent a few weeks in kskdale the beauly of the country made a deep impression on her perhaps the more so from its being the farthest excursion to the southward that she bael then made from her native home the general character and manners of the inhabitants are she believes correctly represented for there is scarcely an incident exemplifying these of which she had not known the coiuiterpart in real life the respect universally paid by the parishioners to their clergyman mid the great influence which he possesses in forming their minds and morals are circumstances which have fallen under her own observation she hts felt a peculiar satisfaction in describing the simple und useful life of mr and mrs martin from thc remembrance of many worthy cjipls h hniltr situations sh ha ea deavoured in relating the adventures of john telfer thc herdboy to impress on the minds of her young readers the permanent advantages ot early integrity and gratitude in thc short and unfortunate life ot william martin she has attempted to show thc duty of subduing a disobedient and selfwilled temper the character of helen is meant on thc contrary to illustrate thc inestimable value of which a dutiful daughter may be her prudence steadiness and even energy on some trying occasions are the result of an education conducted on those principle which ensure the love of the child by a reliance on the justice and affection of the parent in short this is an excellent mothers book we give some extracts the narrative begins in this simple manner in the year 1807 there stood on the beautiful hanks of thc river esk in dumfriesshire one of the most southern countries in scotland a small cottage thc neat white walls ttcllthatched roof and clean casementwindows ornamented as they were with honeysuckles and roses attracteirthc admiration of the few strangers who from the uncommon beauty and grandeur of thc scenery were tempted to turn off the direct road from langholm to edinburgh and follow the windings of the river to its source the cottages in general in that part of the country present a very different appearance  having too frequently a look of neglect the windows broken the walls dirty and instead of a pretty garden a heap of mud before the door the contrast therefore rendered this build  ing thc more remarkable and led people to suppose what indeed was the case that its inhabitants were more industrious and had seen a little more of the customs of other countries than their less neat and cleanly neighbours the names of the couple who resided on this snot were john and marion telfer their history i am now going to relate john was the only son of an honest industrious couple who lived in the neighbourhood of langholm but who unfortunately both died of a fever when he was little more than ten years old leaving him nothing but their blessing and thc virtuous habits of integrity and obedience in which they had trained him from his earliest youth on their deathbed they entreated that the excellent clergyman who in spite of the malignity of the disease continued to comfort and pray by them in their last moments would take compassion on their poor kttle orphan and find him employment among the neighbouring formers either as a herdhoy to some of the numerous flocks of sheep which arc common in eskdale or a ploughboy in their fields mr martin for such was thc name of the pious pastor assured them that he would do all in his power for their chikl and lie kept his word for as soon as they were dead he took thc boy home to hil own house and there endeavoured by kindness and sympathy to console him forhjs great and irreparable loss for some days ail ins endeavours were unsuccessful john though sensible of the kind attentions of mr murtin still felt miserable and unhappy all his dear mothers care and tenderness all thc pains and trouble that his kind father used to take in teaching him to read his bible after perhaps a hard days work thc delight with which they both watched his improvementall all rose to poor johns mind aud made him believe he newer more could be happy mr martin at last seeing the boys melancholy continue thought that a little employment might serve to rouse him he therefore one morning called john into hi study and asked him if he would be so good as to assist in dusting anel arranging some books which mere in a large chest in the  corner ofthe room john from lowness of spirits did not much like to bc employed  but as he had been taught by his father always to be obedient and to do at once whatever he was desired he immediately set about dusting thc books thc first two or three he merely wiped aud put them down without looking at them but at last rubbing one a leaf fell out which obligee him to open the book to put it back again the work happened to be a handsome edition of robinson crusoe with very beautiful prints mr martin who was watching him unobserved culled to him to bring the book and then told him he might look at the pictures if he pleased jolm who had never seen any thing of thc kind before was delighted with this permission and placing himself at a little distance so as not to disturb mr martin began turning over the leaves  his eyes sparkling and his little hands trembling with increased delight at every new scene that was represented at last he came to the one where man friday is saved from the savages here his curiosity got the better of the natural awe he felt for air martin  and he cried out  pray sir lie so good as to tell me what this meansfor though john had been taught to read his bible as well as his poor father was capable of teaching yet this was in so imperfect a way that he could by no means read easily and was obliged to spell more than half his words mr martin smiled goodnaturedly as johns exclamation made him raise his head from the book he was reading and desiring him to come near his chair he explained at some length what the print represented after which he asked john if he would not like to be able to read the story himself jolm immediately answered o dear yes sir that i should  but looking down and the tears starting into his eyes  that can never be now  for my dear father is dead and gone and nobody else will ever take thc trouble to teach so poor a boy jw i am anti yet continued he looking in mr martins face and brightening a little with a kind of hope  dont you think sir that if i succeed in getting a place and if i am very very attentive and alway taite pains to please my master i may in time be able to save out of my wage as much as a penny u week  for i know if i could do that i might so to the school at langholm 1 remember nearing my poor dear father wsh very much that he could afford to pay so much money forme as he said he waa sure that mr campbell would teach me to read much beater than he could the history proceeds through the innocent details of life such as it might bc found in a valley in the primitive age the young peasant grows up la understanding and morals and the ministers family is the place of tranquil virtue but there conies a disturbance to all this quiet in the conduct of a son the minister has hot had the power of communicating his own spirit to his turbulent boy and brother william runs off to sea leaving helen in sorrow the effects of this disobedience tire however most injurious to hil parents his mother overwhelmed with sorrow takes to her bed the scene that follows is pictured with great artlessness and we think with peculiar feeling letters arrive from william mentioning his having fixed himself on board a ship going to sea helen folded up the letters and sat for a few minutes considering on their content her own good sense and feelings of obedience to her parents pointed out to her in how very improper a style her brother wrote  but her love and affection for winiam made her try to excuse him  boys are so different from girls thought she  william hat been away so much too from home and besides he must chase a profession and rt would be hard not to leave him at liberty to be what he thinks himself flt for in the evening of this doy mrs martin felt herself better and for thc first time since her illness spoke to her husband on the subject of william mr martin told her he was with her brother and likewise that he had heard from himself he thea stated what captain elliott had said as to williams being allowed to remain with him but owned he was very averse to this pian mrs martin answered very calmly  my dear husband as fur as my judgement goes i perfectly agree with my brother i would not certainly have chosen that william should be a sailorif i could have prevented it hut as he has acted i think it is thc best thing we can now do he will be under my dear brothers care  and i shall now  controlled she looking at her husband with tendcitwsa  die in peace on hw account convinced fhat elliott will exert every means to correct and improve my poor boy thc last legacy of dying sister mr martin quite alarmed by this address asked lier if she felt herself worse and rose to send for mr armstrong she krid her hand gently on his arm  my dearest love said she  i am not woree bm i own i have been watching for an opportunity of preparing your mtnd for what i believe

his management  and i trust he will endeavour to guard his father from all future anxiety on his account he has cost him epiite enough already the last words were spoken so low that they were evidently not meant for her husbands ear isle had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking when she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer a few days showed plainly that mrs martin knew her own situation but too well she appeared gradually though slowly sinking one evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  i shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed she then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to william anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before it may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then mr martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her one evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health he therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish i will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer leave me for a few minutes you may trust me i will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father mr martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife in half an hour helen and her father were at mrs martins bedside she smiled faintly when she perceived them holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband my dear i wish much to see my mother pray write for her she will i inn sure gratify me mr martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to melrose mrs martin then took hold of helens hand and said  my clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me the length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of mrs m to her excellent daughter it thus concludes helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed when she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing she then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air she obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors mrs ms mother mrs elliott arrived the next day when mrs martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt melrose ind come to live at the manse mr martin assured her that she should ever be considered by him os his own mother his wife joined their hands exclaiming my work is finished in this world i have now only to look forward to another and a better her work in this world did indeed seem finished the next day without any apparent change for the worse as her mother and helen were sitting by thc bedside and her kind anxious husband was supporting her in his arms she laid her head on his shoulder and seemed to fall asleep it was some minutes before he was aware that she was gone for ever thus perished one of the best and most exemplary of mothers entirely from anxious

the two families an episode in the history of chapelton new novels by the author of rose douglas 2 vols smith elder  co so favourableas may be recollectedwas our opinion of  rose douglas that another novel by the same writer could not fail to be welcomed by us with more than ordinary heartiness and curiosity  the two families will neither injure nor increase its authors reputation again and again have we been treated to the contrast betwixt riches without religion and poverty with piety displayed in one and the same family  but the one has rarely been set in array against the other in a manner more entirely void of offence or of those exaggerations which point out wealth as a crime and lowly estate as a virtue in themselves the spoiled child eliza wilson by whose hapless fate the moral of the tale is pointed is well drawn until the moment of her marriage the events connected with and succeeding to this egregious case of sale and barter are forced for the sake of effect we hardly believe that people represented to be so proud as the chamberlyns would stoop to court the parvenus heiress with so little veil upon their cupidity  nor do we imagine that any well bred persons would so nakedly and suddenly commence the course of contemptuous insult which this aristocratic mother and son are described as adopting towards the bride from the very moment when the church had tied fast the impoverished mans meanness to the ambitious girls money but there is a dismal reality in the account of poor elizas return home and the solace to which she subsequently has recourse namely the bottlecomes only too naturally by way of sequel to such an illomened and un equal marriage that to the bottle the coffin shortly succeeds is also in the natural duotder of such a wretched history we are less satisfied with the final distribution of the great fortune and apprehend that the authoress of  rose douglas has small experience of settlements deeds of conveyance c c though her conception of sacrifice and generosity is right royally munificent the country beaux and belles of chapelton and the noisy smartness of the glasgow ladies are not badlydone  but the invention of the two families might have been fully and sufficiently wrought out in a quarter of the compass of the present novel,juvenile

tommy wideawake by  il  ilajiford 3s 6d john lane nowhere is fashion more unconsciously followed than in the publication of books the cult of childhood has become a fashion in consequence book after book appears full of the glorification of juvenility undeniably the subject is interesting youth has an overflowing freshness which is like a breeze through a sultry room to the orderly and routinepermeated minds of mature people a successful book on children is among the best reading a grownup can have but the present craze for literature about juveniles is deplorable the result is a promiscuous idealisation which reduces the subject to absurdity and creates upon the inexperienced reader the most etraordinarv impression of childhood as an embodied and alwas irresistible sermon  tommy wideawake is among the unnatural books about bovs an effort has been made to draw the normal male but the virilitv of manner is not sufficiently sustained to take effect tommv is a boy idealised and the poet into whose society he is flung is still more unlike the poet of ordinar existence the atmo1phere of the hook i fanciful rarefied while the character ketche have none of them sufficient normality to be cony incing  tommy wideawake by h h bashford the story of a boy and of his influence upon the lives of four men who undertake to look after him during his fathers absence on the  eastern trail the boy in a way renews their youth and brings them back to the things that matter  and the moral if you muat needs hammer one out would be this that soundness is more to be desired than scholarship and that the heart of boyhood is by nature nearer ta god than that of later life a graceful story sentimental but never silly lane 3s gd  tommy wideawake by h h bashford lane 3s 6d net  tommy wideawake  is a very pleasant book with open air and sweetness in it and a sense of poetry and quietness it fails of actual achievement for two reasons it is too vague and too sentimental but the sentiment is never silly though here and there it comes perilously near to mere femininity and the vagueness seems to result from too outside a conception of boyhood tommy is boyish enough in some respects but occasionally he is hardly more than the lay ideal round which so many writers have woven phantasies only remotely touched with life yet having regard to the restrictions which mr bashford has imposed upon himseu he has done very well you cannot leave a boy of thirteen in the holiday keeping of four impressionable bachelors without importing an element of exaggerated sentiment and tommy is a fascinating healthy cleanlimbed youngster who might quite reasonably have wrought the transformation in his four informal guardians which the author represents him to have wrought mr bashford attempts a kind of realism here and there but it is less successful than his idealism the scene in which tommy gets drunk after a local cricket match does not strike us as in the least real it is dragged in by the heels for the sake of an effect which is fortunately missed and we are not quite sure about the budding love affair but all this is simply to say that mr bashford has aimed at too much he has tried to make his boy human and at the same time something superhuman there may be such boys though we ourselves have never met them but after all  tommy wideawake  is quito worth reading and it contains at least one very pleasing set of verses,juvenile

the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its

enable us to wish our fellowreviewers a  happy new year  with some hopefulness of fulfilment the story is that of a workingclass couple ideally mated before their marriage he is a prizefighter and she is a laundryhand an appalling picture of the life she escapes by wedlock is given as well as more than one vivid description of his competence in the ring she is possessed of that marvellous strength of sacrifice on behalf of her man which can only be properly appreciated perhaps by those who have experienced it he has the gentleness which goes with strength under control though he all but loses it when his temper is upset by a strike of teamsters his mates in a calling which he follows after his marriage their flight from the sordid struggle of the town to the open solves the struggle of existence for them and further makes the opportunity somewhat too obviously for a display of much agricultural lore in an atmosphere the sweetness of which becomes cloying towards the end of the tale the narrative is written breezily throughout though the authors handling of the bellows has not been sufficiently masked he has perhaps more scorn for than sympathy with the pettiness with which he is obliged to endow many of his puppets in order that they may be true to life the individualism of socialists and the trickery by which even the wellintentioned are content to earn a living are after all but the natural concomitants of an environment in which the breadth of outlook is lacking to make  waste not want not a worldmaxim the tale which is essentially american may not appeal to all

the authors appended to the present volume that a critic remarks it is no exaggeration to say that mr london does for the klondyke what mr rudyard kipling has done for india a reading of the son of the wolf leaves us with the conviction that mr rudyard kipling need be under no uneasiness mr jack londons tales are all  vigorous his men are all muscular heroes his language his style his situations all have the ideal and the downright virtues of muscularity so far so good but we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where mr jack london fails we do not wish to disparage in any way the son of the wolf the nine tales of which the book is made up are healthy breezy narratives of sensational incidents in the  worthland scruff mackenzie goes on the trail seeking a wife braves a whole tribe of indians kills two men and carries off the beautiful zarinska the chiefs daughter xaass an alentian chief travels thousand of miles from the behring sea tracking axel gunderson a modern norse sea rover who has carried off from him the peerless unga of course he lures gunderson and unga to a trackless wilderness in search of a gold mine and of course they die in the most melodramatic fashion the best story in the book is to the man on the trail because it is the least theatrical  in a far country  is a tale with the same motive as  an outpost of progress  by mr joseph conrad to compare the manner in which the two authors bring the same situation before us is to see why mr jack london cannot be called an artist he is a vigorous story teller for the general publicwhich is not a bad thing but his sphere scarcely touches that of those writers who like mr rudyard kipling have created a manner and a method of presentation which is all their own  lhovel lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the valley of the moon by jack london 6s mills  boon the idyllic title of mr londons latest noveland his bestwill neither delude nor deter those who know its predecessors they will know there are grim forces stirring somewhere in the region of this nook of shelter and starlight and that the people who populate it are very fierce realities as a matter of fact the lunar paradise does not arrive until the real action of the book has ceased it is reserved as a kind of reward or escape after many strenuous chapters in which the struggle is not merely one of thew and sinew but a moral war with principalities and powers we get in the opening chapters the hinterland of san francisco at its worst and oakland seems to engage itself chiefly with the clatter of steam laundries the strains of the dancing saloon and the faction fights of public holidays this abrupt plunge into a western world of slang and steam and strife is made palatable to english readers by the pride with which the hero and heroine contemplate their saxon origin but the author must not be accused merely of making an effort to conciliate his critics over here he brings out certain qualities in those two figures which we are glad to recognise as admirablethe more so that the woman is the deeper and more consistent character and has none of  billys weaknesses billy roberts like the book is mixed in his composition brought up as a prizefighter he qualifies as a teamster and handles horses with the same mercy and discretion wherewith he handled men he is certainly a  hunky  gladiator this sixfoot giant of the blue eyes and fair complexion but when poverty and hardships arrive he loses selfcontrol and shows once more that the physical training of the ring however thorough is no discipline for the finer issues of life  saxon his wife on the other hand keeps true to her simple ideals and brings him through her emotions are always fresh and womanly she succeeds in everything her modesty allows her to undertake but she cannot help the author to interest us in certain chapters which are only agricultural pamphlets in disguise this is the real defect of his book from the literary point of view the moral one is that in billys excesses the ethical balance is not sufficiently preserved otherwise we have nothing but admiration for this powerful and human story,juvenile

the life and works of charlotte bronte and i her sitters with introductions to the  works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co fint notice the true criticism of the work of the sisters bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple it ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above haworth parsonage or we might add the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours wanderings in those almost classic haunts the journeyings would reveal of course many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect but imagination after we had come south or gone north would but see a great picture synthetic and simple and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and  spirit of the heathlands the deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe so the general features in thoroughgoing bronte criticism will be sheer simple outstanding the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion for charlotte and emily bronte were strange and intense souls and in their books it is the soul  fact that matters true there are a hundred less inspired things let them be quietly touched and passed the great poetic passionate creative stages are elemental and bold easily seen by those that can see and having duly marked them and told their quality criticism has done its broad work it cannot sound their mystery wring out the secret of their inspiration any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature mrs humphry ward is sometimes thoughtful in her bronte studies but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details we could wish on the other hand that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters work in literature or the evolution of literature is satisfactorily determined in her introduction to jane eyre she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised today by charlotte brontes novels on the imagination of england but this suggests the important and here unconsidered question whether the reading world on the whole realises what great fiction ought to be whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of miss bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute it is to be feared as a matter of fact that england and the continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction and despite mrs wards high opinion of latterday developments of the novel it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature a worthy instrument it has been in some instances a noble one we have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action giving embodiment to as we might say spiritual romance indicating in characters and destinies something of the soul above souls vision of the power that  ever accompanies the march of man the general desire however is that he should walk  rationally  upon earth and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another much too muchis expected of him as a delineator of daily manners till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals the autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance it might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two artsthat of revealing spiritual forces permanent passions like a great poet or dramatist and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities the two powersthe interaction of the two worldsmake the true novel to be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential  a keen problem  necessitates vision intuition opportunity aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction the vision and the intuition are of the greater importance on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis or the work as it were of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a 4 time spirit which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal if the vision of the sisters bronte sometimes failed them it was uncommon at its best and even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life mrs ward like many critics seems to entertain a too narrow idea the sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious knowing the celtic inheritance of the sisters of which more anon their contact with a world of great northern tradition the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad which stirred unimagined forces in their natures and made them critics of life in a higher sense than perhaps is commonly realizedunderstanding all this and more and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case it is the soul that matters not the number of miles travelled the number of cities seen in the actual world charlotte bronte has told as she was eminently fitted to tell the ordeals of souls that live alone in more senses than onethe never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers they are types old and new as the passion for sympathy the lack of consideration in any womans sphere and crises and partings journeys and reunions in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours they speak of souls rather than bodies faults and crudities of construction in jane eyre and its successorsmatters with which mrs ward deals at length  are sufficiently obvious had charlotte bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plotmaking and other prepossessions her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering perhaps almost to real fusion of material but some of her critics strictures on details are scarcely tenable we may not always regard mr rochester so gravely as his creatorhe does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of paul emmanuel but his early talk with jane eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which mrs ward imagines the judgement on the countryhouse party also is much too sweeping without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society one may gently urge that a governess of genius in her merciless way would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing possessing more or less glamour for the polite it is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgement on  high life  it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured but spiritually inferior convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn but the spirit of critical judgment especially after some of miss brontes own stories recorded by mrs gaskell will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side it were better no doubt to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues but haworth was not meet alas for her airy presence certainly charlotte bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical  shirley the novelist as we have suggested is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality but it is possible to slip on points of detail to fail now and then in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material and yet to be true again and again in the high hours to what the imagination recognises as aoulfact because charlotte bronte so vividly interpreted soulfact not occasionally but often we know that however fallible at other times she was an eminent novelist mrs ward maintains the interesting but of course by no means novel theory that the genius of charlotte bronte was fundamentally celtic the racial spirit or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow the momentum the environment of a race of changeful fortunes no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions and is an attractive if rather tentative study though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments but leaving temperaments and workaday selves and looking into the souls that live deeply the souls that create permanent literature we feel that they are of no race they know not geographical boundaries as to charlotte bronte and ireland she seemed unable to create aa irish character  the curate malone ia  shirley and the drunken mrs sweeny ia  villette are beneath notice in this regari but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work it is te be feared however that mrs ward has tee conventional an idea of celtic characteristics her remarks are a little too suggestive of matthew arnolds lectures on the 4 study ot celtic literaturelectures fruitful in their day and still useful but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated gaelic literature and irish or general celtic personality  celtic melancholy is but a halftruth joyousness is the dominant quality of much gaelic literaturejoyousness and n fierce zest of life the theory of though celts love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being  better than loneliness passed into a proverb with one order of celts for the theory of  celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern nor ds mrs ward convincing when she tries te explain bronte celticism as a growth of the ireland of the north on which commerce and protestantism have set their grasp this although perhaps a popular notion is but another halftruth the catholic and celtic traditions and elements of ulster are in their way outstanding in any case did not the rev patrick bronte come of a south of ireland family mrs wards consideration of the celtic basis of the bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real celticism and that the bronte sisters practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the vision that remakes the world were gaelic literature accessible as a whole it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races its modern successor angloirish literature does not really display a true grip of later irish realities and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities the celt has dreamed dreams idealised his moors and hills seen visions of hells and heavens that show a dantesque feeling without of course a dantesque art he has realised the tears of things and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life but he framed the elaborate brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empirebuilder far from being an elusive creature half within half without existence he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds mrs ward did be really know the various aspects of celticism might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious if halfinscrutable life in emily bronte rather than charlotte yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of english genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race there is truth on both sides how much of the spiritual the poetic the divine even lies below either racial consciousness seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment  this deeper human subconsciousness so to say carno 10 consciousness in the bronte sisters on their great moors in their yorkshire world of distinctive tradition in the crises of their struggling years it mixed with moods and found outlet in forms in which celt and touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves so when all is said the origins are of natures underlying store the result speaks for and to humanity  the life and works of charlotte bronte and her sisters with introductions to the works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co second notice mus ward inlier introduction to wuthering heights propounds a theory of an appreciable german influence a somewhat liberal infusion of hoffmann and even tieck in emily brontes work it muet be said at once that mrs ward unfortunately does not seem to realise the spirit and the stages of the  german romantic movement some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this german literature against which carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century  tieck and hoffmann says mrs ward  are full of raving and lunatic beings who sob shout tear out their hair by the roots and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours this to speak mildly is not fair criticism even of hoffmann but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of tieck the whole trend of mrs wards critique is unjust to the german  romantics  at their best to their beauty there is only a casual allusion there is no suggestion of those qualities both grave and humorous in which they are seen to differ decisivelyeven to the merely casual eye from the author of wuthering heights it would appear that mrs wards imagination has dwelled overmuch upon the earlier tieck and on the other hand it is more than doubtful that a mind like emily brontes could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of hoffmann or indeed of his english contemporaries of the school that would  make parnassus a churchyard in fact critics are too apt to exaggerate the  haunting effect of the bowl and dagger book men on the early century we may be sure there was an esoteric english self unimpressed by their terrors monk lewis it is suggestive to remember had no appreciable effect upon the house of commons and the haworth sisters let it never be forgotten had a critical as well as a creative faculty mrs wards theory however will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius as distinguished from casual shades and external dyessome of which in emily brontes case were no doubt germanic as some in charlottes were french anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature we know from charlotte brontes words and without them should realise the truth that emily bronte the creator the emily bronte who means much to the imagination owed little if anything to literature it lit or shadowed her mind of course as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome so to say of the british museum readingroom seem ages asunder in point of date and method all that places her apart owes no more to booklore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous brooding minds in the lonely icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas work to which remoteness from common actuality and profound aloof winters gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood by the way there was of course a norse element in yorkshire tradition and one finds it interesting to trace in emily bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far a critic in the athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in emily brontes genius to something far greater than that of german romancowhich of course at its best had some sense of greatness or at least was deeper than a cult more than a mere fashion in fiction  to no less than the genius of dante himself this is a highly interesting question which unfortunatelyat least so far as the present writer knowsthe acute critic has not considered in detail in this connexion and in view of emily brontes celtic ancestry it were profitable to study that celtic visionary spirit which made many infernos before and during dantes day even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency there was a potential dante in the racial soul and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the celts as to other aspects of the kinship it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain dantesque significance in the chief lovers in wuthering heights abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom catherine in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is heathcliff is no faint reminder of francesca but a dante would not allow a heathcliff or a catherine in hate or love to protest so much the tears and cries doubtless set mrs ward thinking of the minor features of german romance the passion as the forementioned critic recognized runs too much to rhetoric but the concentration not only of speech but of passion which mightnay would surely have come is indicated in a few of emily brontes best poems unfortunately enough in treating of her virtues or defect mrs wardwho holds the theory that  we passionately accept her or we are untouched by herdoes not always employ felicitous figures of speech charlotte bronte touches the shield of the readershe attacks him and complete as his ultimate surrender may be he yields fightingit is still more so with emily this martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelmingand artificial and  wuthering heights whatever its naivete of construction its signs of inexperience does not suggest the artificial it is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition it makes us as it were spectators in strange lands where our word counts for nothing we stand by pits of the passions had it been germanmade to the degree mrs ward imagines instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius it would not have its on the whole decisive imaginative justification were it possible for emily bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposesin short were she an artist of the receptive ordershe would surely have reproduced more of her overyday life in the manner of anne the frail little one in  agnes grey and more gloomily in  the tenant of wildfell hall or in that of even charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active emily was too original for that she obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which as charlotte said in a well known preface strangely wills and works for itself mr swinburne rightly finds in her  a dark unconscious instinct as of primitive nature  worship  unconscious instinct  contains more essential truth than the germanic dissertation of mrs ward and strangely enough if we may touch again the question of emily brontes ancestry in the oldest known fragment of celtic poetry handed down for hundreds of years in irish tradition there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of but absolute identification with nature there is a gleam as well as darkness and though suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering emily would have understood and sympathised with readily the singer is  the wind which breathes upon the sea the vulture upon the rocks  the ox of the seven combats  the fairest of plants a wild boar in valour a salmon in the water  a lake in the plaineverything in his sheer primaeval world as emily brontes spirit was everything in the great moorlands the singer before the dawn of celtic history expressed the dark unconscious instinct in the novelist and poet after sophisticated ages nature again stirred and spokethe nature below books and beyond race eventually of course as we see by the later poems the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy this haworth edition contains besides the novels and poems of the sisters and the  cottage poems of their father their portraits and the original titlepages and prefaces in their due places mrs gaskells life with an introduction and notes by mr clement shorter will conclude the series the style of the six volumes already issued is worthy of the house so honourably associated with haworth though occasionally the printer has neglected quota tion marks we have left to the last a reference to a feature which some will regard as specialillustrations from photographs of places indicated in the works they are of course interesting in their way though the way is too literal they would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones for instance though description of lucy snowe in london is accompanied by a picture of ludgate hill and st pauls cathedral in 1848 the pages have as much to do with ludgate hill of 1828 or 2048 they are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation,juvenile_contra
little england there have been novels already which have shown the wars effect upon the middle classes of england but bliss kayesmith has chosen to picture a corner of sussex and the sorrows in particular of one family in scheme the book she has written most nearly resembles miss may sin clairs  the tree of heaven in  little england as in miss sinclairs book the reactions are as it were concentrated into a small circle a family circle and the book has none of that leaping into political and philosophic digression to which mr wellss  mr britling  and  joan and peter have made us accustomed it is a simplified and typical picture without arguments and without explanations the lives of perhaps a dozen people representing the lives of many thousands of real sufferers by the war are gathered into the pages of  little england and the book is offered to us as a war document if it is nothing else the book is that it is quite definitely a book which   little england by sheila kayesmith 7s net nisbet cabttra phtigait miss sheila kayesmith gives as no other has done its clear record of the way in which war has been met in the english countryside the beatup family of father and mother and five children tom harry zackv ivy and nellis the family upon which mliss kayesmith shows the wars action to them are added thyrza who marries tom and the baptist minister mir sumption and his iked boy jerry tom is killed jerrv is shot the girls have their loveaffairs and marriages through all their dumb followings of impulse the distant sound of the guns in flanders tragically runs it is the war that gives unity to the book and reality also in themselves the persons of the tale are such that the reader can only at times perform that delightful act of imaginative identification they are not intrinsically interesting and they do not step out from the pages as disturbing realities they are typical sympathetically seen and almost always veraciously rendered but they are not vehemently alive to the reader apart from the incidents and the picture in which they have their literary lite that is because mliss kayesmith has seen them as creatures moulded by life and by the war as tiny struggling details in a cataclysm they have been sacrificed so to speak for arts sake now if they had been as passionately real as they are movingly typical little england  might have been a masterpiece that the book is less than a masterpiece is due to the fact that in the hackneyed phrase it has the defects of its qualities when one has seen the war going on and the casualty lists so constantly increased one has ceased perhaps to think of each individual in the battle obviously this must have been so as everyday conversation has testified miss kayesmith has felt the wars largeness and has observed our tendency to think in numbers and uniforms her heart has rebelled against the horror of this failure to imagine the individual life but the inspiration of her book it seems to me is intellectual rather than imaginative it is as though she had resolved to show very quietly and truly the greater truth that every casualty is an immeasurable grief or an equally immeasurable release from apprehensiveness but she has chosen the intellectual method of showing us a group of picturing a typical home and not the purely imaginative method of showing us the passionate hearts of those who have suffered her book is measured and restrained but only within circumscribed limits is it moving it could hardly be deeply moving when the central character in each of its seven parts is a different actor for the air of continuity is obtained only by the invocation of the war as an embracing unity otherwise each character is a sketch merely and is both seen and portrayed objectively to say this without qualification would be to misrepresent  little england which is a novel that one is bound to respect and to admire it has passages of beauty and distinction of real feeling it is restrained and scrupulous to a degree which makes more casual work appear crude and without form nevertheless in the skill and care of its presentation its chosen scenes and words and pictures one has sometimes a great longing for something outrageous some ghastly joke or torment to break the regularity of its scheme and by its jagged rending of miss ravesmiths excellences to shatter these typical figures and start them into life uncircumsciibed it is as a war document that  little england  will take its place among the good novels of the year for its characters are conventional and do not surprise us but as a war document it has great virtue and it is good that we should be made to think that in the wvar as in all other times of crisis or of apathy other classes besides those in which we live have had their actions and reactions their passing joys and their inevitable sorrows frank swinnerton,juvenile_contra

the spanish wine historical romance has its conventions which great novels have obeyed this little tale is not in accordance with one of them and yet i have read few books which have given me a more haunting sense of the history of an epoch and the temper of a country it is in every way original and unexpected in style in methods in results a consciously literary story it never drags in interestrare occurrence a quick eye can detect the most careful patient art in its compression its ellipses its fastidious choice of words but this elaboration has not killed the life and force at the roots of it every person that crosses the stage is alive and strongly individual it lies outside the ordinary world of fiction it is a story of fate slowly prepared long waited swiftly and darkly fulfilled amid the outlawry and the civil war of elizabethan ireland but to me it seems more familiar and convincing than bond street scenes in the hands of ordinary novelists i wish it were all as good as its best parts alas it is very imperfect the critical scene during the siege of the castle where dunluce speaks to his lost wife over the dead body of their son while jessica listens to this past page in her husbands history fresh as she is from a secret but honourable interview with his enemy and her old lover i am not forced by mr matthew to realise clearly and though i prefer slang to sham archaisms the prevailing beautiful style makes such a phrase as  suits you down to the ground come on one with a harsh shock let us forgive slips for the sake of the illuminating pictures of human nature none more so than that of the sensitive loving child who made a lifelong iwound in her heart because she was too vain to own her tenderness for the rough outlawed shamus in face of his gibing foes and for the sake of the poetic spirit which reads things as well as hearts and knows the part they play in human tragedy when we have forgotten some details of the grim story the castle will still loom dark and suggestive in our memories symbol of jessicas life  between the delusive sea and the unfortunate hills a m  the spanish wine by frank mathew lane this is if anything an improvement on mr mathews charming book 4 the wood of the brambles it is more coherent as a story and it has lost none of that books quaint unconventionalism mr matthew has certainly a wonderful power of giving life to his characters one discovers quite casually in the course of the story that it relates to people in the time of queen elizabeth but they might just as well be modern they seem so near and intimate this quality is attained far more by hints and suggestions than by any apparent effort to give them reality or rather the author seems to give the impression that he leaves his characters alone and lets them talk or act just as they choose one is afraid to make any suggestion that might take away from the charming reality and grace of the characters but perhaps even a little more coherence and arrangement in the story would not be amiss as it is there is just a slight difficulty in understanding where the previous history ends and the actual events begin again but after all this is a small matter and in no way spoils the pleasure in a singularly delightful book,juvenile_contra

the first advances he had then made to a reconciliation had been at once received with that cordiality which gerni tins goodnatured and placable disposition would have led one to expect oakley had felt much happier since this interview bad taken place and his present visit was intended not only as a further peaceoffering but as an advance towaids renewed intimacy this apiable temper of mind was

once there is no mistaking that air and figure when once seen the light springy walk too nobody knew what had become of her i always heard she was of a low family who knows but she may be very comeatable   this was said carelessly and with no other object than to annoy oakley and with the view of watching its effect he advanced towards the mirror over the chimneypiece and whilst still speaki ng and apparently examinin germaiiis dinner engagements which stuck round the frame he stole a glance in the glass but the impending storm which he saw on oalkleys lrow was so much more formidable and threatening than lie had expected that his retreat was like that of a man who has no ob jection to admire a tempest from a distance but is not prepared unnecessarily to expose himself to its violence he therefore wished germain an abrupt good morning at the same time however wvhistling  di tanti pilpiti with the most successful precision towards the conclusion of the tale oakley

the white monkey art resembles love in many ways and not least in thisthat the most complete capitulation may be the most complete conquest when a character created by a novelist imposes his wrill upon his creator the creator wins and this is what has happened to mr galsworthy it was in these columns a year ago that i wrote  mr galsworthy wanted to make soames unlovable but soames is not at all unlovable that in face of the general opinion about  the forsyte saga was a paradox but here is a sequel to  the forsyte saga and my paradoxas happens to most paradoxes if you leave them long enoughhas became a platitude before mr galsworthy while apparently with his conscious mind vilifying soames and everything that soames stood for was yet somehow compelled by artistic integrity by direct inspiration by subconscious inclination or by whatever else vou choose to call that divine something which shapes the ends of books to give soames the credit for distinction of mind and nobility of character the unintentional irony was indeed complete for in the conflict in which the saga terminated the conflict over the mutual love of fleur and jon it was soames the  man of property who behaved with sense unselfishness and generosity it was the champions of light and liberty who behaved with malignant and indeed inconceivable egotism and in  the white monkey which tells the result of that conflict and of its solutionor rather of the failure to solve itsoames at last comes openly into his own his merits seem to have risen above the threshold of his creators consciousness and are accepted golden in the light of day he is the one wholly sympathetic and admirable character in the book and perhaps it is because the presumable struggle between mr galsworthys impulse and his intention is over that the new story has an effect of lightness and clearness and at the same time of hardness and solidity like a jewelan effect which was certainly lacking in its sombre and powerful predecessors a sequel is always expected to be a failure but here is one which is a triumphant success 1 am inclined to think it is the best novel mr galsworthv has ever writtenand that is saying a good deal it has many faults but they do not matter much so great is the force of the work considered as a whole it will be remembered that  to let the concluding section of the saga proper ended with a marriage and a funeralthe marriage of fleur soamess daughter to young michael mont the funeral of the almost prehistoric timothy in  the white monkey soames fleur and michael are in the centre of the picture but neither fleur cold and restless in the disappointment of her love and her marriage with a  secondbest nor michael charming and chivalrous and inconclusive is drawn as surely as some of the minor charactersas for instance aubrey greene the artist who occurs only casually and briefly fleur is tempted to try for  experience and engages in a dangerous flirtation with wilfrid the sardonic poet her theory is that as she cannot have love she   the white monkey by john galsworthy 7s 6d net heinemann may as well have sensation but she is not  modem  enough to carry the theory into practice and anyway her immediate perplexities are shelved one cannot say solved by the opportune arrival of a baby michael is a publisher and this gives scope for some excellent satire of contemporary fashions it also provides a link with the subplot the story of bicket who is a packer for michaels firm and is dismissed for stealing he steals to get nourishing foods for his sick wife and she when she has recovered becomes an artists model to get money for him so that they can emigrate and be happy she conceals her method of raising money as he conceals his of course there is suspicion discovery and final reconciliation but this whole subplot is unnecessary and unreal on the other hand another complicating thread of excitement provided by soamess seat on the board of directors of a speculative insurance business is artistically relevant and most admirably handled nobody does directors meetings or shareholders meetings like mr galsworthy he does them very often but not too often for he makes them both thrilling and funny indeed the book is rich throughout in thrills and fun in sheer narrative energy it is amazing and the writing is of the finest galsworthy stampwith one or two almost incredible lapses how in the world does a writer of his stature and of his conscientiousness come to say that a thing  became almost a phenomenon when he means it was

memoirs of a highland lady literature edited by lady strachey murray we were once shown a picture by raeburn of an elderly scotchman an elderly scotch gentlewoman and a beautiful scotch girl they were said the owner an uncle who had fought under clive his maiden sister and their nieceall johnstones of alva if memory serves aright that group has been recalled by this most charming book which like the picture suggests a scotch jane austen much more janeaustenish than susan ferrier its author elizabeth grant was born in edinburgh may 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in bombay cathedral to col afterwards general henry smith of baltiboys lived thereafter in ireland and died november 16th 1885 she was the eldest of the five childrentwo sons and three daughtersof sir john peter grant of eothiemurchus 1774  1848 by his english wife jane ironside whose father was a long  descended clergyman at houghtonle spring sir john peter the only son of a doctor had succeeded in 1790 to the rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle he was an edinburgh advocate and london barrister sat as whig member for grimsby and tavistock and in 1827 having frittered away his 2000 a year and gone bankrupt was appointed a judge in bombay and knighted later he was chief justice at calcutta these memoirs written by mrs smith for her children during 184567 come down only to 1830 and record her life in london at thorley hall hertfordshire at the doune in rothiemurchus on speyside at university college oxford of which dr james griffith one of her numberless cousins was master in london again in edinburgh and in india they have already been privately printed and now are generously given to the world with a brieftoo briefintroduction by a niece lady strachey no book of the kind has proved more delightful  if ever i write a novel mrs smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten inspector and received 40 in return that rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel as it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past here is one that is truly wordsworthian the young people were not of rothiemurchus they lived up in glen feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married he was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man i am not sure which but his business was to mind a large hock that pastured on the mountainsat the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty the wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening she would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to

highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second

folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a

she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent

marmaduke herbert or the fatal error a novel founded on fact by the countess of blessington 3 vols bentley lady blessington has never written so well as in this novel of marmaduke herbert it is altogether her best book in thc construction as well as writing of it the interest is great and sustained by fair and honest means the narrative once begun its design is never lost sight of the attention never called away some will think that it is even too closely and exclusively pursued and the sentiment of it pushed to extremes but this is a question of art which will always arise we apprehend in connexion with thc school of romance to which the book must be said to belong marmaduke herbert is planned aud executed in the manner of godwin that is to say an elaborate investigation of feelings thoughts and motives with minute detection and analysis of the familiar workings of the heart is built upon a groundwork of romantic incident a certain degree of monotony is inseparable from a plan of this kind  but in the ready acuteness of remark the new and happy turns of reflection exhibited by the writer and the value of the lesson steadily enforced we have found thc look extremely interesting the design of it may be briefly described as an exhibition of the evil entanglements which attend concealment of the truth these are shown to be equal in bitterness to the evil consequences which i attend an act of crime in this respect and  in the autobiographical form of the narrative marmaduke herbert reminds us very much of a novel by lady georgiana fullerton which obtained considerable success a few years siuce but the treat ment differs in this respect that the meutal analysis is more closely carried out less distracted bv irrelevant scenes of passion and better accounted for by peculiarities of temperament and education there are minds in which the effort to be wretched with or without reason predominates over every other quality or feeling  and this

by the coun tess of blessington in 3 vols london bentley 1847 this novel displays a great amount of talent it is written in the most vigorous style and a powerful interest is at once c eated which is vell and ably sustained coie recommendation it possesses lies in the fact that it is distinguished from the general run of the novels of the present day by the absence of sentimentality it does not obtrude upon the reader descriptions of dinnerparties and ballrooms introduced in some instancts only to persuade the public that the writer has figured at them such books are very agreeable no doubt to young ladies reclining at their ease upon sofas and ready to be pleased and gratified with any fiction under the face of heaven but they are sickly food for the general reader to the young they seem new but the more experienced novelreader naturally seeks for something more original than a dinner flirtation a ballroom mishap or a toilette reflection the novel before us turns upon a fearful catastrophe the occurrence of which near the commencementof the work poisons as it was intended it should our enjoyment throughout and rouses a painful sensation which mingles strangely with whatever gratification we may receive we feel while the prospect of the greatest happiness is sketched out before us that a gloomy shadow lowers across the level plain that with the perfume of the sweetest flowers is mingled the damp unwholesome atmosphere of death that enter where we will into bower or hall the pale shadow of a murdered girl stands in the threshold pointing to her unwilling murderer and warding off perfect happiness from his path all through life the interest thus created painful as it is is still calculated to arouse intense feelings of curiosity there is a power of fascination in things of this kind our eyes involuntarily turn towards any object which pains us and therefore possesses the power of moving our souls  marmaduke herbert is therefore sure of success public curiosity once excited will be gratified the style of the narrative involuntarily reminds us of the story of caleb williams and this is because though the events are of a different character the incidents upon which the interests of the stories turn resemble each other it is not the actual crime or fault which can be said to be similar but the fact of the concealment of the fault the mere commission of the error in the present instance would not have led to the same results the con cealment of the first step instead of witdrawing the hero from his painful position naturally only flings him stilf more deeply into it one error leads to the commission of another and unhappy himself all through life he renders others equally so the domestic miseries which gradually overtake him from the days of his courtship of the sister of the poor girl of whose dath he had been the innocent cause and constitute a portion of his punishment for his unintentional crime are most ably drawn and do infinite credit to the countess of blessingtons powers of delineation the present novel is we think one of the best of her productions there are no lengthy digressions the story is told well and briefly so that we scarcely ever feel that a superfluous incident is introduced once in the early portion of the novel this occurs but it is a slight fault and we do not therefore insist more strongly upon it there are however one or two remarks which we feel ourselves called upon to make respecting the delineation of some of the characters we can allow a great deal of licence to the author who is engtiged in the task of bringing before us a woman educated in the camp brought up with officers and accustomed to their trodle of life we feel that she runs the chance of becoming mannish even coarse that some of the delicacy of her sex will be rubbed off but lady blessington has in airs scuddamore passed far beyond the mark her character is not well drawn because it is inconsistent she appears at first under very different auspices to what she does afterwards the woman in real life could not have lost sight of her feminine characteristics so wholly as she did or adopted the cool imperturbability only pardonable in a man which she manifests but even supposing this allowable it does not agree with her kind and gentle care of her niece on the first occasion when she is introduced to us nor has lady blessington at all accounted for her change of manner so abrupt and incomprehensible it seems as though the adventure had been intended to be prolonged but bad been accidentally cut short another objection we have to make is that our authoress frequently enters into details upon the subject of the dead body which would look far better in the columns of a newspaper than in the pages of a threevolume novel they are shocking to our taste our feelings are revolted and only at such itites do we turn with abhorrence from the pages there is an excess of brutality in the manner of the man too who brings tidings of the body which is exaggerated in the extreme besides it was unnecessary and as the messenger had no reference to the story it could only have been introduced for the sake of producing a startling effect it is intended to harrow up our feelings the more by witnessing how our heros conscience reproaches and upbraids itself during the scene in which he is compelled to behold the sufferings of his wife and mother while listening to the mans dreadful details but by a little art a better effect might have been prtduced without the introduction of the messengers speeches besides the few faults we have hinted at there is nothing at which we can have any cause for murmuring the story is powerfully told and scattered through the work are many graphic scenes and many beautiful passages as a specimen of both we extract the following  at length 1 reached the opening of the cavern i entered it and laid down the lantern which cast its faint but lurid light on the grotesque rocks around a sickening dread stole over me at the thought of the change which six months must have ef fected in the ccurse i was about to touch and i drew back with instinctive disgust and horror at the task i had to fulfil nevertheless that task must be performed however loathsome however appalling the operation might be and i moved towards the opening of the inner cavern with the intention of drawing out the body when the loud hooting of the owl so startled me that i nearly fell to the earth ashamed of iny pusillanimity i once more approached the spot knelt down and though shuddering while i did so drew forth the corpse by the feet at that moment a huge bat dew against the lantern which i had placed on a projecting rock upset it and extinguished the light for some time i felt unable to move and almost incapable of thinking my hand still clasping the icy feet at length i recovered myself sufficiently to grope in the direction in which the lantern had fallen and after a considerable time spent in searching for it i found it and struck a light with a tinder box which i had fortunately put into my pocket in fear of accident i dared not look on the face of the dead the shawl 1 had wrapped around it still enveloped it and most thankful was i that 1 was spared the horror of beholding its altered state i commenced digging a grave large drops of perspiration dropping from my forehead while vith the pickaxe i endeavoured to loosen the compact earth to enable the spade to penetrate it while i thus laboured huge bats were continually flitting around me and from time to time the screech owls sent forth their lugubrious cries i dug deep into the earth and though ready to drop with fatigue from the hard and unusual labour i desisted not until i had penetrated some five feet beneath the surface i then averting my head while i did so raised the body in my arms its extreme lightness astonished me but the cause was revealed when the shawl accidentally falling aside exposed one of the arms and hands of the deceased owing i suppose to some peculiar quality in the earth or air in which the corpse had rested it had become dried up like those of a mummy though shocked at beholding the withered discolorred limbs it was less dreadful than to see it in an advanced state of decomposition as i expected and emitting that fearful odour which marks the decay of mortality nothing of this  assailed my olfactory nerves and i was grateful to providence for being spared it i placed the matting as a lining in the grave and then descending with my lifeless burden using as much tenderness towards it as if it were still susceptible of feeling i placed it gently in its last earthly restingplace and read the burialservice over it the sound of my own voice as i pronounced the words of that sacred and touching service powerfully affected me no human accent gave the response but the birds of night shrieked dismally while i prayed i then covered the corpse with a piece of matting and commenced filling up the grave with the earth i had previously dug shrinking during the operation at the thought that the cloak and matting alone intervened between the corpse and the clay i was shovelling over it i would have given heaps of gold had i possessed them to have had a coffin in which to place the cold remains but this was not possible and although i shuddered at every spadefull of earth i threw into the grave i nevertheless continued my painful labour until the floor of the cavern resumed its former appearance i then strewed dust over the spot and arming myself with the pickaxes spade and lantern bade a sorrowful farewell to it never shall i forget that night l an unusual stillness prevailedunbroken save by the occasional bark of some cottagers dog or the cry of some bird of night scarcely a breeze moved the leaves of the high trees whose long shadows fell like giants across the road in some parts so close as to exclude the light i hurried on through this solitude my own footsteps sounding so loud us to startle me and the beating of my own heart making itself audible sometimes a low sighing or murmuring of the heavy branches of the trees moved by an occasional gust of wind dashing down through some deep ravine from the mountains striking my ear with so sad a sound that my superstitious forebodings connected it with a supernatural warning of the danger of my mother and i would hurry more rapidly than before until breathless and exhausted i was coum pelled to rest for a few minutes those fitful gusts of the night wind followed again by a long stillness had something so inexpressibly solemn and imposing in them that they made me shudder and when some mountain torrent rutnhed down the precipitous path it had formed for itself leaping wildly from crag to crag and dashing its white foam around i felt as if it were some mysterious agent endowed with power from which i wished to escape and again i hurried on until out of hearing of its deafening noise then blaming my unmanly weakness i would turn back for a moment by the dark and funeral mountain pines and the next instant breaking into light its white masses like huge heaps of snow falling from some alpine height into the valley beneath with the sound of a mighty flood and angry with in self for even the momentary delay i would resume my rapid pace while the fresh mountain air failed to cool my fevered brow or burning lip at length the spire of the village church near my home became visible its little vane shining brightlyin the moonlight often in the days of my childhood had it guided my path home from the rambles i delighted in  and now weary and fainting i hailed it with an emotion that brought tears into my eyes i trembled violently as i approached the house i longed yet i dreaded to pass its threshold toe know my fate all my future happiness seemed to hang on the answer that awaited the question my tremulous lips refused to utter  have i still a mother a deathlike silence reigned around the garden gate was unlatched and i stealthily entered it and passing through parterres of flowers that looked snowy white beneath the beams and whose fragrance filled the air i approached the door lifted the latch hurried through the hall and into my mothers chamber there reclined on her bed the curtains drawn aside and four large waxen candles throwing their flickering light on her pallid face i beheld the dead one cry escaped my agonised breast and i fell to

mrs matthews  or family mysteries a novel bv mrs trollope 3 vols london 1851 mrs trollopes works of fiction aie generally improbable in their plot exaggerated in their cha racters and somewhat coarse and vulgar in their treatment but there has hitherto been an energy and pungency about them which carry the reader with her she is often disagreeable but has never before been dull if one has a dislike to any particular class of persons it is especially amusing to follow mrs trollope through a three volume caricature of them but in the quiet and peaceful walks of taletelling this authoress is by no means so engaging a prizefighter hitting knockdown blows in the ring was a person of some interest to that happily extinct race of corinthians  who loved to see  punishment given and received but if the athlete doffed the champions belt and as has whilome happened took his seat in the house of commons he became a very dull inconsiderable unit now mrs trollope in  family mysteries is like a prizefighter turned legislator or justice of the peace there are indeed occasional very occasional snatches of satirical pugnacity she makes a high church clergyman connive at his sons running away with the daughter of a rich neighbour and she pictures the reverend gentleman as worldly obsequious and polemical she draws also a priest such as priest never was setting aside however these scintillations of mrs trollopes chronic hostility to the ministers of every creed and of every church the book is very much of the orderunreadable the story opens with a description of how mary king a mature spinster who bad seen half a century of winters engages to marry mr mathews a well to do bachelor of sixtytwo because her father pathetically implores her to do so upon the score that this overripe paternity was in grievous fear that when he was dead there would be nobody to sign receipts for rent or to see that the home meadows were properly drained mrs trollope however always makes the plot of her books turn upon a marriage settlement and the staid and wary mary king battles through a long chapter for  bookmoney ret pinmoney to the extent of jf500 ayear submitting in return to allow her intended a right to dispose of the united family fortune after her death to a certain illegitimate grandson of her sexagenarian lover mary king spinster had for thirtyfive years enjoyed a queerlooking room up stairs stuffed full of books  and there she had lived and worked she had laid up hidden stores of most unfeminine learning read latin with a heterodox fluency and spanish portuguese and other unknown tongues by the aid of her huge lexicons and borrowed grammars but mary king had once been nearly in love a certain john anderson had looked his wishes but had started for india and had not spoken them john anderson now writes to mary kingbecome a matrona letter telling ber that he had married and had survived his wife that he himself was now dying and that he had confided his daughter with about 7000 to her care after a long time the orphan arrives and so does the illegitimate grandchild and the mnage at weldon grange is complete then there is a sir charles otterborne whose principal peculiarities are an affectation of great cordiality a propensity to shake peoples arms out of their clavicle and a liking to the dice box there is lady otterborne pale anxiouslooking and with a thought a memory or a secret in her heart there is the handsome intellectual herbert the son of this couple and the hero of the novel moreover there are lords squires and retired merchants making up the county society the reader very soon discovers that janet anderson is every inch a heroine and that stephen cornington the grandson notwithstanding his superhuman beauty and very respectful flatteries is in every thought and act a swindler the instinct of a heroine of course preserves ber from falling in love with a swindler however handsome dashing and soft in song but herbert otterborneah that is a diferent matter herbert however is engaged to be married to emily steyton who is to receive jf80000 on the day of her marriage now emily steyton is very beautiful and very rich but she has two faults the first is if that be a fault in a lady that most imperiously she will have her own way the second that she falls in love with every new man she meets flirts desperately in drawingrooms loses her way in the woods during the progress of a picnic party and is brought back after some hours absence by the handsomest man in the companyhe not being her betrothed the end of this young ladys career is that she elopes with a very estimable young man of very pliable temperthe son of the parish parson that her father immediately forgives her and she becomes a happy wife the moral of course is that there is nothing for female happiness like a good heartless round of most compromising flirtation and a plunge into matrimony at last the swindler after hectoring about and making mrs matthews and everybody else very uncomfortable is found out st last there is a weakly worked scene of bis attempting to rob the house wherein he is frustrated by the hero of the piece sir herbert otterborne of course herbert and janet are duly married in the third volume herbert had only consented tb marry the heiress in ordr to release his father frbm his dfflculties and his mother from the imminently impending danger of being turned out of dobrs when the heiress ran awav therefore herbert was not inconsolable although sir charles felt bound in honour toblow his own brains otitthiseventhaving happened herbert and janet and mrs matthews and lady otterborhe become the jolliest of mortals and o the story ends we have omitted to state that when john andersons affairs were wound up he was found to have died insolvent and his laughter was therefore a pauper when fokind out by mrs matthews and brought to weldon grange we take up this stitch in order to make plain the following extract which is one of the best bits of the book  janets introduction to thk pricks the presentation of janet followed ami no stranger ever received a moue smiling welcome

might have done had she been made of iron or stone 44 it will be a very gay affair i suppose said mrs price taking up as it were her husbands nodding process and going on with it 44 have you almost finished your rug miss louisa  said mrs matthews lo the daughter ot the house who had never suspended for a moment the action of her needle though the sympathetic movement of her flaxen head showed that she too took a lively interest in the conversation all the energy of ber character however was immediately turned into another channel by the question of mrs mathews 44 finished  why dear mrs

very literally had made everything she had on 44 four cause tb borrow a significant phrase for if she had not her mantuamakers bill must have been paid by charity but no opportunity was afforded her for mrs mathews rather abruptly turning her back upon her addressed mr price   i suppose this wedding will take place in london sir  this looked very much as if mrs matthews was not in a good humour for as she probably knew perfectly well it would have been very difficult for her to have said anything more painfully grating to the feelings of mr price than these words mr prices wishes were probably none of them very vehement or impassioned but rarely or never had he wished anything more earnestly than that the heir of the manorhouse and the heiress of the lodge should be united in the band of holy matrimony in his church aud that he himself should pronounce the nuptial benediction  did sir charles say so  demanded he with his usual gentle accent but not without betraying a little agitation  i am not quite sure whether he did or not replied his tormentor but it is much more likely i think than that tlny should be married here poor miss louisa actually turned pale as she listened to these words for she was honoured by the intended bride with a greater degree of intimacy than she bestowed upon any gther young lady in the neighbourhood and in her very heart of hearts she had both hoped and expected that she should be selected as one of the bridesmaids had mrs matthews happened to look at her at that moment instead of looking at her mother she would hardly have had the cruelty to persevere in her fabulous statement for the woebegone expression of her pretty little face was piteous to behold but unfortunately the attention of mrs matthews was just then attracted to the generally very unmeaning countenance of her mamma but which at that moment was considerably less unmeaning than usual for her eyes were earnestly directed to the thin and not very new black silk of which poor janets homemade suit was composed and there was much too decided an expression ot scorn in the curl of her lip and her countenance to have been called unmeaning at that moment mrs matthews saw it all and understood it all which might be an evidence perhaps of the acuteness of her observation  but the result was certainly not an evidence of the goodness of her temper for abruptly turning to mr price she said in her clear distinct voice which rarely permitted any word she uttered to be unheard or its meaning misunderstood  things seem to be going rather sharply against though oxford gentry mr price particularly in out neighbourhood if all that i hear be true i am told that dr belton is to be the new dean and he is eositively the roost thoroughly lowchurch divine that we ave  dont call him a divine my good lady i do mo9t humbly beg and entreat tint i may not near any such epithet applied to him we have fieldpreachers mrs mathews fieldpreachers and streetpreachers in abundance who are ten times more orthodox than he is cried mr price with a degree of vehemence that brought a deep flush to the very roots of his grey hair  he is an absolute infidel on many points ho added with a sijjh  and a most audacious dissenter on othersand as to the rubric i know that he said     never mind what he has said mr price and if you will believe me you had better begin to speak of him with a little more civility and a great deal more caution for if they are going to make a dean of him now you may be very sure that it will not be very long before he is rhaden bishop and when that is done mr price i feel quite sure that your own sense ot propriety will make you very sorry for anything you have ever spoken against him you know sir we are told that  a binhoj must be blamelen and that upon such authority as you will not choose to deny but do not let us talk any more about it there can be no doubt i believe that dr belton will be a bishop and therefore though less we any of us say against him the better poor imr price was fortunately rather a thin man and his pulse constitutionally beat time very temperately for had it been otherwise he might have been in danger of an attack of apoplexy for he was at that moment as greatly irritated as lt was in his nature to be and very justly too perhaps mrs matthews was aware of this for she suddenly let him alone and was meditating making a generous atonement for all her misdemeanours by looking at and admiring the immortal hearthrug when must unluckily she perceived that the eyes of miss louisa were now engaged erecisely in the same manner that those of her mamma bad een a few minutes before in short mrs matthews very clearly perceived that ihe dress and accoutrements of john andersons daughter were undergoing a scrutiny which they were by no means particularly well calculated to stand and this was a great deal more than it was in her nature to bear with patience she felt it the more too because she wss conscious that she had been herself most culpably unobservant on this point she had looked certainly more than once in the face of janet and found it lovely she had studied its varying expression and found more than one look that set her thinking a great deal more about the looks ef the father in days past than of the dress of the daughter in days present but thia was ber own fault and not that of neat nice welldressed mrs price and her fair louisa i and had mrs matthews been a little more reasonable abd a little less revengeful she would not have left the parsonage so mightily wellpleased with the idea of having made herself as disagreeable to its inhabitants as it was well possible for her to do during the very moderate interval that shs permitted her

nature and human nature by the author  of sam slick the clockmaker 2 vols hurst  blackett how far either yankee or novascotian nature how far that wider humanity which is the same from china to

as consistent in their interdependence and separately as complete as the links of a perfectly fashioned chain we are not in the very best case for maintaining that an artists pictures are truthful

be in his case exaggeration as well as vitality we could hint even that there is something like sternes faded sentimentality and falseness in the clockmakers pathetics in short we do not swear by our

recommended as another excellent articlenot merely in right of its educational caricatures and because it satirises that indelicate hyperdelicacy which mrs trollope and capt marryat denounced as a plant of diseased growth in americabut because our author keeps the balance true and after having shown us a silly sentimental shallow pretender exhibits her satirist as smaller than the victim of his satire when he pains her by a practical joke which though play to himself is death to the poor woman this tale however could not be reduced within manageable limits without spoiling it moreover we

fiction i goslings by j d beresford wm heinemann 6s in spite of a fascinating manner and an assured skill in the development of his theme we are inclined to think that in this novel mr beresford has taken in hand a task that tired him the idea of a plague with a peculiar preference for men which works its deadly way through civilised nations until the state becomes entirely composed of womenif we except the man here and there who is saved for engineering purposes and other purposes which will be obvious to the readeris distinctly a good one for three parts of the progress of the story it is finely worked out and the characters introduced grip the attention admirably the ending however is rather forced we wish mr beresford could have thrashed his problem to the bitter end without letting us down easily by the introduction of a shipload of men from america where the plague fortunately for the book had exhausted its force had he found the courage to do this grimly careless of what might chance in the way of criticism we should have had a memorable piece of work as it is we find a most interesting novel witt an ingenious plot which will certainly take its place among the distinguished fiction of the year but then mr beresfords other books achieved a similar distinction and we had hoped for something even better,juvenile_contra
the history of matthew wald i i e i f is no feature in which the novels of our age liffer more from those of the last than in the speculative and ideal cast which they have assuned the bustling plots crowded with incidentsthe characters leveloping themselves only in action the brief and meagre descriptions the system which considered subjert as every thing and execution a matter of comparative insignificance have been supplanted by more intellectual and we cannot help thinking more interesting views plots have become simple even to poverty the province of action has been narrowed to extend that of thought feeling has become the mainspring of interest and its analyses and expression the test of talent descriptions of external nature have become more graphical and mi nnte and their connexion with the business of the taleas influencing by their secret but sensible power the feelings of the agentsis better understood and rendered more effective and available the first of these systems certainly indicates a want of refined feeling in the public it was altogether of a meaner and more mechanical castit addressed itself to a lower class of feelings and might have been acted on by minds of no deep feeling and even of scanty invention for though the process of creating an original story is one of no trifling effort the task of combination or disjunction is not a difficult one and a very slight acquaintance with the history of fiction enables us to see how frequently the composition of these novels of incident has been a work of alteration rather than invention they had one advantage however in the very mediocrity of the principle on which they were constructed they were seldom tiresome if the reader perused them with little of that deep thrillin interest which he now feels we have no doubt he yawned less also if he wept lessbe laughed more there were fewer chances of failure for the effect of a sequence of ludicrous or striking incidents admitted of little variation and in the hands of an author of the greatest or the most slender talent produced only a pleasure differing a little in degree but the more ambitious system of modern novelists while it renders the power of genius more visible and vindicates more certainly its lreeminence over mediocrity makes the works of the lesser herd utterly wretched and intolerable destitute of those hum bler attractions of plot and incident which they might have attained andl filled with ludicrous and impotent straining after those more magnificent qualities which it is hopeless for them to emulate or aspire to the present work has nothing to do however with these it belongs to the higher class and if we wished to prove the superiority of that principle of effect on which our modern tales are constructed we know not where we should find a better example wdith a plot of a grosslydefective kindwith few incidentsfew characters of importance and one the most interesting of these appearing only and disappearing as in a dreamwith little aid from humour and less from the mere paint ing of external nature in short by the mere force and grandeur of individual scenes and the general eloquence and beauty of the writing this tale creates and maintains the deepest and most vivid interest and we close it at last with those feelings of dreariness and desolation with which we peruse the remorse of caleb williams or the settled gloom of st leon after his final parting with his son often in the course of the story we feel the unsatisfactory na ture of some of the incidentsthe want of connectionof explanation theunreasonablesupinenessof some of the characters at one time and their fiery and needless impatience at others with a multitude of et cetera but still we are hurried along by the impetuosity of the narrative and it is only when we have fairly finished that we have time to think of all the authors offences against consistency and to wonder how with so many faults obvious to every one we should have so yielded to its influence but the truth is aw this only shews how little sucl things 4 d weigh in the balance of excellence and how easily the atoning power of genius can efface such errors the author is evidently a man of great talent his humour to be sure we do not much like but his pathos his scenes of passion and his eloquence are of the highest kind his conception of character we estimate more highly from his reginald dale tonne than from the present work yet even here there is a wonderful effect about his sketches his females we have always thought particularly captivating athanasia was very good andl helen hesketh admirable of the heroine of this tale we see almost nothingsbe is remorselessly married in the beginning and passes only once before our eyes until the conclusionand yet even this unsubstantial pageant has something about it that lingers in our memory another beautiful and quiet female is opposed to her gentle affectionate and tinged with religious melan choly and her character is touched with the same chaste and powerful pencil wald himself we cannot help thinking disagreeable and none of the subordinate agents of the story are particularly interesting but we suppose the reader would rather form his own opinion and though it is difficult to select any pasage that can give a proper idea of the characteristic vigour of the book we shall extract a few of the shortest accompanying them only by such a notice as to render them intelligible the story is related like those of godwin in the first person an arrangement well suited to such tales as depend for their effect on the expose of feeling and particularly to those where the narrator poees no extraordinary qualities euther of evil or good and may therefore

then denned myself in my garret and i need scarcely say that i did not honour the distinguished company with my presence at their breakfasttable next morning but how acute was my ear how distinctly did i hear the carriage steps slap and the wheels begin to roll the death of sir claud breaks up the party wald commences sur geon in the county town in the neigh bourhood and joanne retires to the residence of that old servant who had related her story to matthew wald the following is the picture of their retirement and of one of the visits of wald i deferred this visit therefore till the last evening of my stay when i easily found my way to a lonely and as lovely a retreat certainly as ever sheltered the infirmities of age or the sorrows of youth fast by the green margin of the noble ora and embowered among the fading foliage of his birches stood the little rustic shieling for which that gentle child of misfortune had left the hall of her fa therm the hill rose precipitous behind clothed to the loftiest crag with copses wood from the midst of which here and there the red gigantic trunks of the native pine towered upwards waith their broad sable canopies the wide stream rolling in heavy murmurs close under neath the branches of the trees its dark brown waters gleaming with the gold of the sunset appeared to cut off the wilders ness it embellished from every intrusion of the world asmllu skiff lay chained to the bankand slowly did i urge it with my single strength against the deep and steady flow of the autumnal river from without the appearance of the cottage itself was rude and even desolate but within the habits of another life had already in the course of but a few days begun their triumph i had to stoop ere i could pass the threshold and i trod upon a floor of naked earth but the exquisite cleanliness that had entered with the new inhabitants had of itself robbed poverty of all its meoness every thing upon the walls shone bright in the blaze of the nicelytrimmed wood fire and mammy sat in her elbowchair at the side of it a perfect specimen of the nmajestic repose of extreme but unbend ing age it seemed to me that there was something far more grand about the whole appearance of the old woman now that i saw her under her own paternal roof the bluntness of address and expression which had before been a sort of oddity to amuse a circle of tolerant superiors was now the natural privilege of indepen dence though indeed i am not sure that the sense of home and the instinct of hospitality had not somewhat softened already the external manifestations of a temper which no change of circumstan ces could have essentially altered i was received with courtesyeven with grace and when a minute or two afterwards miss joanne came into the room and modestly saluting me drew her stool towards m1ammys knee i really could not help thinking that in spite of all the young ladys native elegance of aspect and carriage a stranger might easily have been deceived and supposed himself to be contemplating a family group i you will have no great difficulty in believing could not contemplate it with out some feelings of awkwardness as well as of admiration the situation in which i saw joanne bar was new and her demeanour i could not help thinking was almost as greatly changed we had been used to treat each other like friends some spell seemed now to hover over us both our eyes seldom met and neither addressed more than a few syllables to the othershe took her work and i sat listening or pretending to listen to mammy at last i contrived to make it be understood that i had come to take my farewell that i was to leave the country the next morning mammy gave me her blessing very affectionately and i bowed to joanne the poor girl said nothing but in a very low whisper it was  i wish you well sir wherever you go she did not put out her hand and i retired stammering more good byes i jumped into my little boat and had pushed myself a few yards from the brink when i heard my name called in joannes sweet voice and perceived that she had followed me to the bank of the river and was holding something towards me in her hand i ran theskifin again and shc tooped to give me my gloves which i had le behind me our hands touch ed each otherand in the deepening twilight and in the midst of some con fusion of my own i could not be blind to the blush the deep grave timid blush and the troubled workings of that half averted eye how much may pass in a moment my little boat was out in the stream again almost instantly and yet the words return and hope had been whispered and while in rowing acros the river my eyes were fixed upon the lowly cabin i perceived that a shadow was still lingering in the windowand a soft dream floated over my heart that some day i should indeed return and that the world after all might still re tain some visions of hopeay of tender ness and soothing consolation for me even for me no fiery pulse beatno maddening ecstasy or passion fluttered in my brain these were strings which had been snapt but a calm pensive feeling was deep upon me i cannot explain it no man loves twice perhaps in the same sense of the word but although the pinetree will never sprout again after he has been levelled to the ground what need hinder plants of humbler statute yet of softer foliage to spring from the soil beneath which his ponderous roots are mouldering joanne and wald are marriedand great changes follow wald re covers evidence that the connexion between sir claud and the mother of joanne had been such as would according to the law of scotland amount to a regular marriage and that his wife was consequently the heiress of his estatesand the fa mily of sir claud are glad to com promise the matter by ceding to him the property of barrmains his hap piness is qualified however by a strong metlodistical feeling to which the gentle mind of joanne had been for some time yielding and to di vert her

personality but of his productioni we are bound to speak with respect it is far above the common level whether as regards its invention or its composition the scene is laid at the close of the seventeenth century whene the bastille was strong and supposed to he impregnable and within its walls were horrors accumulated such as the imagination sickens to portray in painting this terrible abode of innocence as well as of guilt of the victim as of the crimiinal the author has put forth his powers of lescri ption which are by no means inconsiderable and through the agency of his heroine

strangers at lisconnel by jane barlow hodder  stoughton an authority on idylls says rather testily   after the use made of the word by tennyson in his idylls of the king which are epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragic in their incidents it becomes very difficult to say what may not be called an idyll this is cowardly to put the mildest censure on it surely a man and a scholar after reading poems epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragio in their incidents should find it very easy to say  there are compositions whioh may not be called idylls of such are these poems of the king i will not believe that even the shade of tennyson could be set aquiver by a quiet polite comment to that effect meanwhile it is here not so important to decide what is not an idyll as it is to deoide what an idyll is the word  idyll looked into is seen to mean  a little picture   and all the best idyllmakers from theocritus to jane barlow have given us little pictures for a little pioture it might naturally be supposed that one would ohoose a little subject a cottage rather than a castle little claus rather than big claus this again is what the best idyllmakers have always done even when the doing of it must have gone somewhat against the grain the great pastoral poet of greece makes an infamous act the theme of his eulogy because the doer of it was ptolemy the great pastoral poet of greece was partial to royalty but he did not make royalty dominate in his idylls lycidas was a goatherd goatherds harvestmen fishermenthese we meet in the famed idylls of greece very different they are from their brother  craftsmen whom we have known in the flesh if theocritus has drawn them truthfully the explanation of this fact is to be found in the time and the clime in which they lived their world was younger than ours by two thousand years the sky above them was a sicilian one well might they in the worlds youth and worlds garden live a life so free from care that they had to  make up  their sorrows 1 it is profitless perhaps but it is rather tempting to conjecture what would have happened to them if they had been sent  jumping oer times  the bold phrase is shaksperes to our time and if they had been brought to a standstill at lisconnel among goatherds harvestmen and fishermen in a world older by two thousand years with an irish sky over this bit of it among folk whose life is so laden with care that they have to  make up  their joys my feeling is that even lycidas who goatherd as he was could recite poems of his own composition upon occasion would have succumbed to what to any but a grey eye or soan irish eye would seem lamentably lacking in matter for poetry it is impossible to praise in excess the consummate skill with which miss barlow has made anew little pictures of the loveliest with this drear lisconnel for background and in the foreground nothing brighter than the blue of mrs kilfoyles cloak for what painters call a point of colour they who echo the famous german who said ich hasse ail zweitenmale may put down strangers at lisconnel at once  for it is nothing but what it calls itself  a second series of irish idylls no better than the first because better could not be but as good a fact which should be emphasised because there are people who think that as good could not be jerry dunnes basket is as witty as any story in the first series and is notable on another account till it appeared daudets little tale called  la mule du pape  was probably the best story of this kind yet told it is now the second best miss barlows being by just as much better than it as an irish toss of the head is bettermore sweet and commendablethan a french kick  jerry dunnes basket tells of an irish toss of the head and  la mule du pape  tells of a french kick of the pathetic stories more especially among them  mrs kilfoyles cloak  a good turn  boys wages  con the quare one i should like to write at great length but space forbids it is here possible only to give a few of the many passages in these tales and others which one marks as showing  the quality  of them we are taken out of the bogland for a look abrpad  the road climbs to the top of a hill and stops there abruptly as if it had been travelling all the while merely to look at the view there is only one writer living who could have written that and only one writer living who could have written this  the shower was a vicious one with the sting of sleet and hail in its drops pelted about by gusts that ruffled up the puddles into ripples all set on end like the feathers of a frightened hen as a sample of miss barlows own satire which is real irish point take this  ody was leaning against the wall critically examining brian kilfoyles blackthorn and forming a poor opinion of it with considerable satisfaction not that he bore brian any illwill but because this was his method of attaining to contentment with his own possessions sometimes there is a sounding of the profundities what was there in it asks thady before the beginnin of everything thady was a small anxiouslooking child whose pale and peaky face his mother often likened regretfully to a haporth of soap after a weeks washing he had spent a surprisingly considerable part of his six years in metaphysical speculations and was always disposed to make a personal grievance of the difficulties in which they constantly landed him his tone was now rather peremptory as he repeated what was there in it before the beginnin of everythin   sure nothin at all said his elder brother peter to whom the answer seemed quite simple and satisfactory but joanna looked as if ene had caught sight of some distant object which provoked hard staring   then what was there before the beginnin of nothin   pursued thady 4 dunno said peter indifferently  unless it was more nothin   sure not at all that wouldnt be the way of it joanna said dreamily yet with decision  if there was nothin but nothin in it thered ha been apt to not be eer an anythin ever whered it ha come from y dont be tellin the child lies peter why for one thing she said her tone sharpening polemically and taking a touch of triumph there was always god almighty in it and the divil maybe thats what you call nothin  peter evaded this point saying what peter said will be found in the tale called con the quare one i do not give it for two reasons i want the reader to go to the book and i want to give another passage you are to know that a theft has been perpetrated in lisconnel a thief has appeared there his appearance is followed by that of policemen it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of two active and stalwart civil servants would have been welcomed as happening just in the nick of time yet it argues an alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means possible the men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to the category of pitatyblights rintwarnins fevers and the like devastators of life that dog a man more or less all through it but close in on him a pitiful quarry when the bad seasons come and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin wid the hunger and his own heart is broke therefore to accept assistance from them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most reprehensibly unnatural to put a private quarrel or injury into the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the public foe a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a trivial temporary convenience lisconnel has never been skilled in the profitable and useful art of utilising its enemies not that anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments much less attempted to express them in set terms when a policeman appeared there was an inquiring mood what people said among themselves was  musha cock bim up i hope hell get his health till i would be tellin him or words to that effect while in reply to his questions they made statements superficially so clear and simple and essentially so bewilderingly involved that the longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle them there is a very general idea in england that irelands history has been written by moore lecky froude keating and some others and there has grown up a practice of late years of rather industriously studying these writers who are some of them interesting but are none of them quite reliable it is a curious fact that the writer who is the best historian that ireland has yet bad miss jane barlow is not only more reliable than any of the historians named above but is also immeasurably more interesting than any of them froude is considered by those who do not trust him wholly to have had a pretty wit it becomes very ugly when compared with wit like the above perhaps it is after all not for nothing that irish wit is accounted the prettiest

general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public

in a glass das is a glass darkly by j shoidan le faau in throe volume bentley the two tales that fill the second and third of these volumes have lately appeared in magasins and though we do not remember them we suspect that the three shorter tales contained in the first volume have also been already published they have evidently been strung together without much care and neither the absurd title given to the collection nor the prefatory chapters to each serve to link them into an orderly seres they purport to have been translated from the memoranda of dr martin hesselius a german physician and to be specimens of some of the numerous  cases of a kind to amuse or horrify a lay reader  that came under his own professional experience or were reported to him by his friends four of the stories may be included in this description but the longest and best of them is only a welltold narrative of the way in which a young englishman visiting paris shortly after the battle of waterloo was duped drugged and nearly buried alive by a gang of rogues of this story the boom in the dragon volant little need be said save that it is quite as good as any of the longer tales that mr le faun has written and better than most it is a capital instance of that best sort of ghost story which in the end proves to be no ghost story at all a mr robert beckett going to paris with the intention of speculating to the extent of 800001 at the gamingtable meets on the way an old french count and his young wife whom he twice rescues from danger and another frenchman who represents himself as a marquis in disguise and who brings him what purports to be a letter of introduction from a friend in england the pseudomarquis offers to guide him through the riy enjoyments of paris and the soft young man thus falls into l the trap he is put in the way of clandestine interviews with the countess who of course offers to run away with him in order that she may get hold of his 300001 and hand it to her husband we will not tell how the ropm in the dragon volant which is supposed to be haunted is put to excellent use in furthering the plot for this is the main secret of the story one need less absurdity however is introduced mr beckett is drugged by some infusion which paralyses him for several hours yet leaves his eyes open and able to observe every thing that goes on around him whether such a drug exists we leave mr le fanu to settle with the chemists but if there were such an one no clever thief would use anything so likely to facilitate the detection of his crime if however this one needless absurdity is in the room in the dragon volant it is as nothing in comparison with the preposterous incidents that mr le fanu has imported into his other tales the first of these tells of a clergyman who was haunted by the corporeal spirit of green tea a sort of monkey speaking good english in an audible voice and finally goaded by his tormentor to commit suicide the hero of the second is a naval captain who is strangled to death by the tangible and audible ghost of a man whom he had injured long before in the third a judge having wrongfully caused a person to be hanged is lifted out of bed by the spirit of the victim and himself hanged in his own house in the fourth a young lady is courted by a vampire and only saved from death by the timely discovery of the vampires earlier misdemeanours and these repulsive stories have not even the slightly redeeming merit of literary or artistic skill in the telling as a setoff against their ugliness of design they are simply ugly and repulsive yet they are clever enough to do mischief unfortunately the world is not sufficiently educated in disbelief in everything that purports to be supernatural for the reading of such stories as these to be harmless so many people believe even on scriptural authority in ghosts and witches satanic influences and physical resurrections that their belief may be sometimes confirmed by modern adaptations of mediaeval horrors in his vampire story mr le fanu makes his heroine rejoice that she was one of those happy children who are studiously kept in ignorance of ghost stories of fairy tales and of all such lore as makes us cover up our heads when the door creaks suddenly or the flicker of an expiring candle makes the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall that surely is a curious taste that objects to a fairy tale yet dresses up in the most seductive fashion a story of a girl whose bosom friend sucks her blood in the night and then goes to digest it in the grave to which she had been consigned more than a century before,juvenile_contra

  new novels why did he do it  by bernard capes methuen  co when mr capes condescends to melodramatic mystery he is apt to take it too lightly he is well equipped for it but to succeed perfectly a writer of melodrama must believe in it or at least not show that he does not believe in it in  the great skene mystery mr capes spoilt his effects by laughing at himself if he must laugh in these affairs let him laugh in his sleeve probably that is what he did when he wrote  why did he do it  it is a fantastic piece of work written with all the skill and style of the author and starting from a very original motive which teases and tantalizes there is perhaps a little disappointment in the fact that the hero is largely divorced from the unravelling of the mystery which falls into the hands of a friend a second defect is that one guesses the nature of the secret half way through and perhaps a third may be added for some tastes at any rate because the mystery has reference to the occult mr capes can draw character with any novelist living but it is not part of his business to delineate human beings here he is content with the conventional and the grotesque it is a pleasure to read a sensational story written by a literary hand even if he does not take his task altogether seriously,juvenile_contra

carefully contrived skilfully developed and to the last page entertaining to nothing is this first consideration sacrificed there is not a line of intrusive strain after fine writing there is no flimsy pretension to artistic profundity or labour for comic or sensatioal effect no kind of display in short but the quiet accomplishment of the true purpose of the storyteller in sustaining pleased attention to his tale the plot is so natural in its course that exception has been taken to the probability of a main incident that would have been taken for granted as a minor touch of life and nature in any sensation novel for the day is not yet gone by of straining at gnats and swallowing camels two persons in mr lemons story are half brothers one of whom gilbert norwold goes wrong and is befriended by the other gerald but gerald when arrived at mans estate is passionately reviled by his father for a base crime of his halfbrothers his halfbrother standing treacherously by and the only tangible evidence in the matter being a piece of paper that appears to convict the innocent mr mark lemon upon this makes the highspirited youths blood stir with resentment at injustice if his father knows no more of him than now to revile him as a thief why should he bandy words if a thief why not a liar the only evidence beyond his word is that which seems to tell against him and his brother would dispute his word gerald therefore leaves gilbert to his shame acepts the decree of banishment casts off his name and proudly resolves to found for himself a new name and a new house of tuntarshed honour this may not have been a wise thing to do but young men acting in hot blood are not red for the mature wisdom of their decisions a passionate vow a generous extravagance of action that bside into calm wisdom never more surely than when as in this story there is the influence of a soundhearted womans love at work upon the after life such is the common course of nature when the heart of a young man in sharply stung it is a high compliment to the truthfulness of colouring in this story of waitfor the end that such an incident should in its context appear strained beyond the warranty of our experience of life in fact the tone of the book is peculiarly suggestive of a ripe and genial experience it s a story unaffectedly told by a writer who is content aimply and unreservedly to give his natural mind free play in the telling mens true lives are not a joke to him and he often speah with a plain human earnestness in his own simple genial way it is only when the reader finds this or that scene afterwards dwelling like a picture of real life in his memory and has begun to analyse the source of his satisaction ina book of which the author for his own part laid no ostentatious laim on his applause that he southeast how much ability and worth have here gone to the making of an english story  wait foi the end a story new novels by mark lemon 3 vols bradbury  evans that mr lemon has written a novel will from more than one point of view be news of mark to those who care to gossip about literary men and their doings mr mark lemon may almost be regarded as a veteran amongst authors and many people will be eager to test the quality of a first novel by a man of letters who as nfeuilletohute aud dramatic writer has achieved a brilliant reputation some of our best living novelists made their first essays as writers of prose fiction when their years were few and tneir personal experiences limited  vivian grey and  falkland were the productions of mere boys mr dickens and mr kingsley were young men when they ranged themselves amongst the followers of defoe and henry fielding the case was otherwise in the last century  robinson crusoe made its first appearance when the author of the trueborn englishman was in his fiftyninth year  joseph andrews and  the vicar of wakefield  came from writers who had left boyhood far behind them samuel richardson was over fifty years of age when morality was encouraged and virtue rewarded in the pages of  pamela lawrence sterne was a middleaged man when he published the first two volumes of tristram shandy smollett began to write prose fiction at an earlier period of life than most of his contemporaries in art but he had seen and done much ere he penned  the adventures of roderick random and when search in a parish register destroyed the pleasant fiction that evelina was the work of a young lady only seventeen years old it was found that  little burney  had entered her twentysixth year ere she published the tale which won the applause of samuel johnson and burke mr mark lemon therefore by publishing his first novel when he has numbered fifty years and more reminds us of the earlier history of the english novel wait for the end claims attention on another ground the author being also an editor stands in public estimation accredited with many of the piquant jests and some portion of the genial satire with which the contributors to punch have both in recent and more remote years held up to ridicule the tricks and devices of popular novelists thus he is a man who having flung stones now takes up his residence in a house which though it may not be made of glass still has its windows exposed to the return shots of merry fellows bent on fun the hero and the villain of  wait for the end are halfbrothers living at the opening of the tale as undergraduates in the same college the elder brother gerard discovers his younger brother gilbert cheating a foolish freshman at cards and insists that restitution of the dishonestly won money be made to the dupe unless tnis restitution be made gerard declares he will reveal gilberts nefarious conduct to their father sir john norwold a choleric ferocious baronet who will indubitably turn out of doors the son who has dishonoured his name gilbert is unable to repay the winnings but in order that he may do so gerard agrees to join him in raising money on loan instead of having recourse to usurers in london or cambridge after the fashion of undergraduates the brothers borrow money of two rascally tradesmen of the country town adjoining their fathers estate this is the first absurdity of the story besides the personal security of the two young men the lenders insist on having lodged with them a valuable piece of  portable property without the concurrence or knowledge of his elder brother gilbert turns burglar breaks into his fathers house and steals from his mothers room a costly bracelet which is in due course consigned to the knavish miller of morden thus the brothers obtain possession of a small sura of money which without crime or subterfuge of any kind they might easilymuch too easilyhave procured in london the rest of the complicated drama turns on this transaction sir john norwold becomes aware of the theft and attributing it through gilberts vyjany to his elder son drives him from morden hall the oldfashioned fathers  keyurse  of the british melodrania thenceforth becomes the chief power of the story gerard it must be born in mind is represented as a very sensible and courageous as well as thoroughly honourable man but instead of clearing his reputation of the hideous blot put upon it as he might easily have done he emigrates to australia leaving his abominable brother master of the position  to free myself he says to his friend jack spraggatt  i must condemn others to the same fate as that my father has decreed to me this justification is scarcely consistent with the character of the man who resolved to have his brother turned out of morden hall an outcast unless he made restitution of his pilferings at cuds leaving his coat and waistcoat by the side of a river that flows through the paternal estate gerard goes to australia and turns sheepfarmer novelists of a certain sort regard the presence of a coat and waistcoat on a riverbank as conclusive evidence that their former owner has surrendered possession of his life as well as his habiliments if a complete suit of wearing apparel be found near water the fact indicates bathing  but the coat and waistcoat lying on the ground without shirt boots stockings and trousers signify suicide  it being well known that gentlemen when they drown themselves always elect to do so in leggings and braces the disappearance of the heir or morden and the discovery of his castoff clothing being regarded as proof that gerards body has been carried out to sea gilbert obtains the baronetcy on his fathers death and in due course marries and prospers in australia gerard also does well he grows rich marries and has a daughter who at the conclusion of the third volume becomes the wife of gilberts eldest son this is the end for which readers are requested to wait mr lemon should correct in a new edition a few slips of the pen which a fresh eye easily detects thus the author puts the high street of oxford in cambridge he marries lady clara normanton to sir gilbert norwold and afterwards calls her lady norivold it is a mistake to suppose that leases of farms are put up to auction like leases of london houses when jack

instructed by the respected tenant of that very productive and eligible farm to sell by auction the remainder of the lease together with all the stock live and dead farm implements c and when jack spraggatt swears an oath to his sister and says  thats  nonsense the author adds in an aside speech  yes he did  it was very wrong but knowing what jack meant the recording angel wrote it down beside uncle tobys oath it has slipped mr lemons memory that uncle tobys oath was not permitted to remain on the record the accusing spirit sterne assures us  which flew up to heavens chancery with the oath

1 the doctors wife ts new novels by the author of lady audleys secretc 3 vols maxwell  co in the october of 1862 we noticed lady audley  secret and in october 1864 we are about to review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his

after a new excitement in every chapter and to maintain the readers curiosity are compelled to make each one more outrageous than its predecessor such tales as that betorc us are better calculated to make a permanent impression upon the memory while they are far more wholesome entertainment than the class of which they are antipodes galt is manifestly our authoresss model and the only fault we have to find with her is that she has been too faithful to her teacher and has not sufficiently trusted to her own indubitable powers which would have enabled her had she dared to be original like most imnitators of a style she has copied not alone the excellences but the detects also of her model and the former she has somewhat weakened by over elaboration one of the most remarkable characteristics of galt was a terseness of expression which enabled him to throw a 1rge thought into a small sentence so that frequently he was almost epigrammatic now the authoress of them passages has not this faculty of condensation and so while closely adhering to the cast of thought which made galt so dear to his readers she puts it into many more words hence it would have been better for her fame if she had compressed this novel into two volumes as well she might have done the incidents not being very numerous may we hope that in her next endeavour she will remember that it is no longer essential to a novel that it should fill exactly three volumes it may be one or two or three or four according to the actual necessities of the plot the passages in the life of mrs margaret

touching moral the following extract will tell the story to any reader of ordinary imagination  tiif faii or jessik haut and so it happened that when mr arnolds brotherthe london lawyerasked the vicar of little millbrook to recommend him a neat wellconducted maiden of good person and address to do the lighter duties of his house he recommended jessie uart and in the course of a few weeks she was duly installed in guildfordstreet the old lawyer hated flunkeys he might have kept half a dozen had he wishedbut he detested though whole race of men servants and a njat active girl like jessie hart did all a footmans work for half thc money with half the noise and looked a hundred times prettier whilst doing it this indeed was the worst part of the matter she looked a great deal too piquante her light figureher slender waisther small handsher elastic stepher graceful carriagewere all so pleasant and attractive that it was difficult not to follow her with your eyes as she moved about the room doing her spiriting gently and with a ready cheerfulness which made you feel that it was no taskwork to her there was something too very open in her manner she waa not forward or immodest but there was a dangerous kind of unreserve about her which might have been misunderstood it was in reality nothing but frankness and cordialitybut with people less singleminded than herself it placed ber at a disadvantage andit ruined ber at last how mr arnold may tell it has been necessary that i should write this much in explanation to render intelligible what fell from the good mans lips he asked me if i knew that jessie hart had returned home and i answered that i had heard a vague story about her returnbut that i hoped what i heard was untrue  untrue alas sullivan and there was a deep and sorrowful solemnity in bis voiceif what you heard wasa story of poor jessies shameand if you heard associated with it the name of gilbert arnold my son it was not untrue i could say nothing and he continued  sullivan i hope i am not uncharitable i hope i am not intolerant i do not think that in a harsh or unforgiving spirit i ever viewed the errors of the youngi know what are their temptations i know that feeling for the most part is stronger than principle within themthat passion is headstrong irresistible that there are some allurements not to be withstood it is often permitted to us sullivan righteously to pity whilst we condemn for those who love over much there is always some pity to be claimedwe say the sinner was a loving one and we shed a tear over the sin if my son had come to me and said  father i have sinned before heaven and against herbut the temptation was strong and i was weak and we love one another i would have taken him into my arms and blessed him as he lay

old court life in france by frances elliot 2 vols chapman  hall there are few subjects better worth treating than the one now taken in hand by mrs elliot thc majority of english readers even those who have travelled abroad and lived in paris are lut imperfectly acquainted with the old court life of france they know something but little of the names of certain kings they know nothing or what is popularly called next to nothing of the people who surrounded those kings and who were often less puppets than movers and impellers of the sovereign such courtlife details present themselves to most readers as the scenes of a new drama on a subject if not entirely novel yet strange and attractive to an audience wearied with authors and actors who year after year go on thrashing the same modicum of chaff in such dramas as this court life there is great splendour com bined with much variety mrs elliots history is not strictly  history she makes her characters speak aa she imagines they would be likely to speak and we must say that mrs elliots imaginative powers are considerable she indulges in such writing as we find in sensation novels and allows us to witness a very liberal quantity of caressing and kissing which we dare say took place as described or ought to have taken place and so is artistically put in but when  stopping her mouth with kisses  is in the foreground of these courtlife incidents hardened as we are our modesty gets somewhat alarmed and wonders with trembling as to what the next stage direction may lead us to infer mrs elliots volumes begin with francis the first and close with louis the fourteenth the former king has always appeared to us as a fortunate ruffian who has had honour far beyond his deserts except valour of a certain sort he had not a single virtue and what would a man be without  the manly heart courage 1 louis the fourteenth was more of a gentleman in his vices than francis the valour of the grand monarque however was not of such a heroic nature as flatterers have proclaimed it to be louis southeast plaint de sa grandeur qui lattache aa rivage was not meant for satire but nothing more sarcastic was ever uttered it might have been said by a courtfool instead of by a courtly poet like boileau there is if the word be permitted a  rascalry  about most of the fine gentlemen who figure in the old court life francis the first could praise the virtue which he could not prize  her soul is as a rose without a thorn he said of his wife claude whom he killed by his brutal indifference mrs elliot truly says of the position of diana de poictiers mistress of the king and next of his son that nothing can more mark the freedom of the times than this liaison and she speaks of diana as being  one of the brightest ornaments of the court the royal mistress was in truth as beautiful a piece of shabbiness as ever lived but morals were in a very confused state francis who after his capture at pavia said or is suppose to have said all is lost except honour stooped to tell a lie in order to get free and according to mrs elliot his sister marguerite prompted the chivalrous monarch to that unchivalrous act when mary stuart appears upon the scene there is a sense of a pleasant change but mrs elliot might have made more of her that hapless queen never looks so bright as when saying smart things against catherine de medicis the marquis de bouilli has noted some of them in his  history of the dukes of guise mary took especial delight in expressing her contempt for catherine as belonging to a family that had been in trade perhaps mrs elliot has been afraid to say of marguerite de navarre all that was to be said and indeed it would make the hair stand on end to read it  she lives in a world of intrigue is a mild form of speech by which to describe one side of the life of this orthodox and erotic lady while to say that  she pendulates between henri de guise and le molle and a thousand other flirtations is a form indicating a certain regularity in a life which was altogether irregular we confess to little or no admiration for most of these people we do not feel any remarkable reverence for that vert galant henri quatre nor do we acquiesce in mrs elliots judgement as to the feminine tenderness of henris mistress gabrielle destrees the mother of henris son the duke of vendome in succeeding chapters the romance of history is not so well told as the history without the romance in the count de st aulaires  histoire de la fronde and when we come to the period of louis the fourteenth we hardly know which are the worse the showy swaggering men or the audacious shameless women lauzun was the typical frenchman of a long period there are a few exceptionally good individuals who occasionally turn up in the moving crowds at the court of louis the fourteenth and ono la valliere who like the young augustine thought pleasure should come before repentance a scene between the lady and louis the fourteenth will give the reader au idea of what we may call the subdued lovestyle of the writer in which she calls in the imagination of her readers to endorse her own   pressed by the king to grant him some mark of her favour la valliere becomes so confused she cannot reply louis grows more and more pressing interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit in the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder again bursts forth and poor louise overcome at once by fear love and remorse swoons away the king naturally receives the precious burden in his arms he seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his attendants in order to obtain assistance ever and anon he stops in the openings of the forest to admire her as she lies calm and lovely in repose her long eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheeks her halfclosed lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth i leave my readers to imagine if louis did not imprint a few kisses on the fainting beauty ho bears so carefully in his arms and if now and then he did not press her beloved form closer to his breast if in this he did take advantage of thc situation chance bad afforded him he must be forgiven  he was young and he was deeply in love words cannot describe the surprise felt by la valliere on recovering to find herself alone born along in the kings arms in the midst of a lonely forest history does not however record that she died of terror or that she even screamed  but perhaps and indeed doubtless she would have done so had not the respectful behaviour of the king reassured her  old court life in france old court life in france by frances elliot chapman and hall historical romance is the handmaid of history even when history has emancipated itself from the level details of the old chroniclers and lives for us in the pages of a macaulay or a froude with something of the passions and changing interests of real humanity there yet remains a place for the historical romance history i3 by profession at least impartial its backward gaze is too comprehensive to allow minute portraiture its aims are too lofty to admit of any but the widest sympathy the nation or the individual as he contributes to the national life is the historians theme in his true function he is a methodioal accountant taking stock of the past who omits nothing balances the errors of one man against the failings of another the greatness of one state against the ambition of another adds nothing to and takes nothing from the facts and figures that lie before him and finally presents the world with his estimate of results in however perfect a manner this operation be performed it is evident that there is yet room for the historical romance rightly composed the romance clothes its heroes with no more living and personal interest than they possessed ra the flesh  but it contrives by a due subordination of details an artful grouping of the principal figures and a light as of the natural heavens thrown on the picture from above to make the whole world appear subservient to that particular spot in space where the little drama enacts itself if the rom ancewriter is a poet so much the better shakespeare though he drew from no other source than dry old hollingshed has filled the story of the plantagenets as far as he told it with life and energy  calling to his aid the fluellens the bardolphs and the falstaffs he made the reigns of our plantagenets something more than landmarks of english history if we had one sterling writer of national romances with genius enough to raise him above the level track of history and yet no coiner of mere fancy with an alloy of fact we should perhaps be greater as a nation in proportion as we saw in the light of today the greatness and littleness of the past mrs elliot does not write historical romance in this way she occupies an intermediate place between the romancer and the historian she presents history in what margaret of newcastle would have called a  romancical dress her method lacks the continuity and completeness of dumas but it allows of greater accuracy and a closer study of character useless details are avoided the material is scanty and at times almost crude  but irrelevant matters are suppressed and those on which must hinge our conceptions of the mans character are thrust sedulously to the front it must be confessed that to interest the reader on such a plan is an arduous attempt it would have been easy to fill in the story with a few legitimate and even historical incidents but mrs elliot has it seems feared to mar the general effect by redundancy  she has avoided the full narrative style of miss freer for instance and elaborated instead a series of animated scenes which in word gesture dress and attitude are intended to be the counterpart of history that mrs elliott has failed sometimes to present in due relief the historical personages who serve as subjects for her nice pen is not to be wondered at that she has succeeded so well as she has is a matter of congratulation one danger we may safely say she has entirely escaped her chapters though often short and fuller of matter than of words are never tediously epigrammatic though it is impossible in this style of work that the artist should be lost in the picture you are not called away too often to admire her artistic qualities the first eight chapters of old court life in france are devoted to francis i his two queens first claude and then elinor of spain one blameless layfigure succeeding another appear the necessary appanages of a court diane de poitier and anne duchesse detampes are the true queens of the hour mistresses not only of the king but in some small degree of the destinies of france the dynasty of mistresses is however scarcely inaugurated in the time of francis the first marguerite de valois and constable bourbon complete the picture in this first essay however mrs elliot is by no means at her best the second group fuller of dramatic incidents offers greater facilities for success catherine de medici the mother of three worthless kings the organiser of the squadron of court beauties the inventor of the sidesaddle forms the central figure from the time fatherinlaw francis  romped with her the entire evening after her arrival to the day when half a century later she lay on her deathbed while the due de guise was murdered overhead this was that due de guise whom the second marguerite de valois would have married but that her mothers ruthless will gave her to the bearnois henry of navarre most of those men whose fortunes and destinies were mingled with catherines during her halfcentury of power and in whom dumas found a neverending source of mystery and intrigue cross mrs elliots stage she has treated them and everything that concerns catherine with much dramatic power and we are inclined to think that this series contains the best written of her sketches as a specimen of vivid description take this of the familiar party of three mother and two sons watching the st bartholomew massacre from a closet over the gate of the louvre to them enter navarre and conde heretics but royal ones who have escaped partly by favour but as it appears mainly by chance charles had recovered his nerves he now looks on huguenots as game and has been potting them with remarkable precision from the window with hideous mirth he boasts to navarre and conde how many heretics he has brought down with his own hand he counts upon his fingers the names of the huguenot chiefs already slaughtered he yells with fiendish laughter when he describes how coligni whom the night before he had called  father looked when dead  by the light of god it is a royal chase  shrieks charles as the page quickly reloads his arquebuse u that last shot was excellent not a heretic shall be left in france again he points his gun and shoots  a piercing cry follows charles nods his head approvingly we will have them allbabies and their mothers  break the eggs and the nest will rot our mother says wellwe must reign we will no longer be contradicted by our subjects we will teach them

are repulsive to look uponyouprinces i have called hither out of compassion for your youth to give you a chance for your lives as you are alivebut by the holy oriflamme  thought you were both dead already the scenes which unfold the life of henri iv are scantier than we could wish and the episode of gabrielle destrees occupies rather too many of them undoubtedly the most important figure in her  show of kings henri iv deserves a larger space than mrs elliot has allotted to him quitting henri iv mrs elliot comes to the times of richelieu mazarin and anne of austria annes husband the bilious and melancholy louis xih surnamed  the just is summoned to live again his miserable unkingly career in her pages and we then drop suddenly upon louis xiv inaugurating his reign with the ruin of la valliere we cannot however attempt to follow le grand monarque whose court life occupies the latter half of mrs elliots second volume the sketches grow more voluminous towards the close  the last of them is called  the end and from it we make the following quotation  then the dying monarch turned his face towards madame de maintenon who was seated within the ruelle of the bed 41 madame he said in a low voice  i regret no one but you i have not made you happy his voice hitherto firm now faltered but i have one consolation in leaving you he added  we shall soon meet again he tried to look at her but madame de maintenon turned from him with disgust she huddered  what a rendezvous  she muttered half aloud  he cares for no one but himself bolduc the kings apothecary was near and heard her say so that very day she left him while he dozed and drove away to saintcyr on sunday the 1st of september louis died his confessor the jesuit letellier never returned madame de maintenon remained at saintcyr save the cardinal de rohan and the parish priest of versailles all had forsaken him no sooner had  breathed his last than precautions were necessary to guard his body from insult  e are not of the opinion that much is to be learned from the extravagant licence and splendid vices that ruled te court of france mrs elliot has confined her story within courtly bounds and offends no one by the plainness of her speech but after all an intrigue is an intrigue whether the parties to it are kings and duchesses or grooms and servingwomen  and we venture to doubt the ultimate use of such a book as mrs elliot has produced with this reservation we confess to a keen appreciation of the artistic merits ot  ula uourt late in trance hp  oli court life in france this is the fifth edition of a book that has had many readers and many critics it is the kind of book that is especially annoying to scientific students of history who are both jealous and scornful of narratives treated without tootnotes and without much visible aid from documentary evidence unless they are labelled  imaginative literature mere scraps of history in picturesque setting lay figures with historic names affixed and made to play the part which some contemporary gossip has assigned to them are to their mind frivolous and from an educational point of view dangerous the critics are wrong we should never think of going to such books for exact information on every page of this one for instance we feel how the materials have been cooked the scantiest knowledge of history is enough to make us often read characters and motives differently but it does give the popular idea and picture of the personages and events described from a long study of contemporary memoirs from long familiarity with the country the authoress has learned the fitting stage properties has noted the gossip and the anecdotes she has used all her gathered materials not with imaginative power but with the skill and swiftness of the scene painter and scene shifter the result is a nondescript kind of thing neither history nor romance but it is very readable it is a very vivid series of pictures we are given of the princes and lords and ladies of gay old france from francis and marguerite of valois and diane de poitiers down to the last days of the grand monarque when court gaiety died out under the heavy influence of the maintenon and the troubled dawn of a new world the plates from miss pardoes  memoirs of the french court have been reproduced in these volumes which are reissued in a very

  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering has secretly loved her but

race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages

a memoir of jane austen by her nephew j e austenleigh bentley the writer of this memoir occupies the classical post of vicar of bray how long he has held it does not appear yet as he remembers attending the funeral of his aunt more than fifty years ago we can conclude that the air of the vicarage of bray is still favourable to longevity mr austenleighs recollections of miss austen are somewhat scanty the impressions left upon the mind of seventy by the persons known at eighteen can hardly be otherwise when the favourite aunt jane of boyhood has developed after death into an admirable painter of character wheii the works which were treated half contemptuously by friends and indifferently by the public have become classics there is necessarily a greater gulf than can be measured by years all we learn of miss austen is that she was attractive in her appearance that she had a charming animated face which is faithfully reflected in the portrait prefixed to this volume and that she was a delight to children particularly to her nephews and nieces her tastes and habits were simple and homely she was not accomplished according to the present standard of accomplishments but her modesty was almost as conspicuous as her genius when we add that there were no events in her life that she was never married nor asked in marriage that she lived in total seclusion from literary society and neither knew nor corresponded with any contemporary authors we have given a summary of the materials out of which mr austenleigh has constructed this volume that he has made a pleasant sketch is under the circumstances much to his credit aud the glimpse we have of miss austen will add to the charm of her novels we have said that her personal characteristics may be summed up in a few lines not much more is told of her method of composition she wrote on a little mahogany desk in the general sittingroom where all the rest of the family were occupied and where she was liable to constant disturbance readers of  northanger abbey will remember her modest account of her own powers  the little bit two inches wide of ivory on which i work with so fine a brush as produces little effect after much labour but of this labour we hear scarcely anything it seems indeed that miss austen began to write when almost a child that before the date of her first published work she composed several tales not without merit but which she considered unworthy of publication and that  pride and prejudice was written when she was only twentyone in one of her letters she speaks of having lopt and cropt at this novel so successfully a3 to make it shorter than  sense and sensibility which though written later was published sooner something further might surely be obtained by referring to her papers many of these mr austenleigh says have been destroyed by her family but we infer from another part of his book that there are some remaining as it is internal evidence is sufficient to show that in the midst of family distractions miss austen worked up her novels to a high degree of finish currer bell speaks of this characteristic while professing herself unable to understand why miss austen was so much admired sir walter scott writes apropos of  pride and prejudice on his third perusal of it  the big bowwow strain i can do myself like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early it is a still greater pity that she met with no such appreciation as this during her life her first novel was offered to a publisher and declined by return of post the manuscript ofnorthan ger abbey was sold to a bookseller in bath for 10 and remained in his drawer for some fifteen years miss austen herself collected some of the opinions expressed by the reading public of her day and was much amused by their diversity one lady called  mansfield park a mere novel while another said its language was poor and there was nothing interesting in the characters one gentleman read the first and last chapters of emma but did not look at the rest because he had been told that it was not interesting while a lady pronounced  sense and sensibility  and  pride and prejudice downright nonsense how remarkably these opinions contrast with the judgement of macaulay who as his sister lady trevelyan informed mr austenleigh  proposed to write a memoir of miss austen with criticisms on her works to prefix it to a new edition of her novels and from the proceeds of the sale to erect a monument to her memory in winchester cathedral perhaps the most significant illustration ofthe difference between contemporary neglect and posthumous fame is to be found in the remark of the verger at winchester cathedral who was asked to show her grave  pray sir he said  can you tell me whether there was anything particular about that lady so many people want to know where she was buried almost the only tribute paid to miss austen while she was alive came from a quarter where we should least expect it the prince regent was so fond of her novels that he read them often had a set of them at each of his residences and accepted a dedication from her of his own accord his librarian too gave miss austen hints of which she could not avail herself at one time she was requested to take a clergyman of the type of beatties minstrel for her hero at another to write an historical romance illustrative of the august house of coburg in reply she avowed herself the most unlearned and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress  i must keep she said  to my own style and go on in my own way and though i may never succeed again in that i am convinced that i should totally fail in any other with all her apparent diffidence it is clear that she must have been more or less conscious of her success we see this partly in her criticism of other writers partly in her boast that she attempted to create rather than to reproduce it is a high tribute to one who did not go beyond her own sphere of life for events and characters who said in a letter that three or four families in a country village are the very thing to work on that her own relations never recognised any portraits in her novels mr austenleigh says that this was not owing to lack of opportunity for several of her acquaintances had the most tempting peculiarities and laid themselves open to caricature it certainly was not owing to want of power as we may see amongst other things from the plan of a novel according to hints from various quarters which was left amongst her papers the piece is too long to quote but its quie comedy is delicious what miss austen thought of the higher class of contemporary novels appears from the following allusion to waverley  walter scott has no business to write novels  especially good ones it is not fair he has fame and profit enough as a poet aud ought not to be taking the bread out of other peoples mouths i do not mean to like  waverley if i can help it but i fear i must i am quite determined however not to be pleased with mrs s should i ever meet with it which i hope i may not i think i can be stout against anything written by her i have made up my mind to like no novels really but miss edgeworths es and my own the pleasant appreciative irony of this passage is thoroughly characteristic of miss austen she makes herself forget for a time that her own novels have put very little bread into her mouth that she has always spoken in the humblest tone of their merits she adopts the pedestal of an aggrieved author preparing to be driven out of the field by a new comer and looking forward woefully to loss of fame and profit her real feelings on this point were as her biographer tells us cheerful and contented she received 1501 from the sale f  sense and sensibility and considered it a prodigious recompense for that which had cost her nothing it is something that miss austens genius was sufficient for herself that she was ready to delight others without caring for a reward and that she shed abroad the gifts of her bright sunny nature and never paused to ask whether they were appreciated  a memoir of jane austen c1     by her nephew j e austen leiili    j i uien xeigiu second edition to which is added lady susan and fragments o two other unfinished tales london  bentley and son in obedience to the unanimous demands of his critics both public and private mr austen leigh has now produced from the family storehouse nearly all the fragments of his aunts compositions which might reasonably be supposed to be of general interest we say nearly all because he has not published  exictso the first twelve chapters of the work on which she was engaged at the time of her death neither has he had thc courage to produce even a specimen of the many half burlesque stories written when she was little more than a child the editor is perhaps right in avoiding everything that might bear the appearance of bookmaking but our faith in his judgement is rather shaken by his having waited for encouragement from without before introducing us to lady susan and the watsons the latter fragment is quite in miss austens best manner and as it was begun in 1804 or 1805 it is not easy to account for its having been laid aside the scene is laid at the usual countrytown and the story begins with a ball where the heroine humanely dances with a little boy whose uncle we gather was ultimately to marry her the watsons are the bennets with a difference that is instead of a clever elizabeth and an amiable jane we have a goodnatured but vulgar elder sister and a heroine who is only wellbred and sensible while the other sisters are quarrelsome and underbred instead of fast and silly in miss austens hands there was therefore no danger of the work turning out a repetition of pride and prefttdice and we must therefore suppose that she was not satisfied with the plan of the story or perhaps strange as it may seem that she could not get on comfortably without a leading idea of some sort or a moral to be enforced and of this there was certainly so far no sign with lady susan the case is very different it is a study rather than a novelette and a study which there was more originality in making fifty years ago than now when dangerous heroines are so much in vogue we need scarcely say that there is no sensationalism in miss austens sketch of such a character and that she keeps strictly within the limits not merely of the possible but of the real her lady susan is a clever and attractive woman far too sensible to murder anybody and not likely even to figure in the divorce court at the same time thoroughly unprincipled but fortunately without the quite miraculous powers of deception with which later novelists would have enriched her thus it happens that the young man who is to marry her daughter escapes from her snares before it is too late while we are free to suppose that the young man whom she marries herself will be tormented and perhaps ruined but probably not poisoned or otherwise made away with the story is written in the form of letters but though that device s very well suited to a subject which turns more upon revelations of character than on incident we have not time in ninety pages to feel at home with six or seven different correspondents to the memoir itself mr austen leigh has been able to add a few more of his aunts letters of the same general character as those already published and a categorical assurance that anne elliot and fanny price were in no sense whatever the fruit of personal experience on the contrary we are told that jane declined one suitable offer in her youth and though a favourite sister thought that she might have been persuaded to marry a gentleman whom they met at the seaside if he had lived to ask her so remote a possibility cannot be supposed to have affected her subsequent happiness the cancelled chapter of persuasion in which anne and captain wentworth come to an understanding is far inferior to the one in the published work and perhaps all the more on that account helps to raise our opinion of the writer by showing that judgement had a share in her successes as well as inspiration in the first draught the eclaircissemcnt was brought about by the admirals blundering and everything was arranged so easily ind naturally that the result was rather tame the captains letter written on the spur of the moment in a crowded room gives a far more heroic turn to the conclusion though it is only in real life or miss austen that so slight an incident could pass for an event as the

is like that of the great french cook who wanted only an old kid glove out of which to make the most exquisite of volauvents but the great literary artists are her warmest admirers southey declared her more true to nature than any other of his age macaulay proposed to write her life and reedit all her novels coleridge was loud in her praise and guizot speaks of the pleasure he owed to her sir walter scott asserted that she  had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful i ever met with but we have still stronger because quite unconscious testimony to the hold these novels have taken on very cultivated and gifted minds without a trace of plagiarism without a thought of imitation on their part we see the impression which miss austen has left on novelists as unlike herself as well can be they may probably have never remembered at the time nor ever suspected afterwards how much they were indebted to her but nevertheless the debt must have been incurred did any one ever read  the small house at allington and fail to recall at once barton cottage in  sense and sensibility   there is the park and there is the great housethere are the widow and the two girlsthere is the lovemaking and the faithless lover the surroundings of the story are the same and much of the story itself a still more striking illustration is furnished by lady georgiana fullerton never could two writers less resemble each other than the  author of emma and the author of grantley manor they are unlike in style in temper in motive the one is a restrained and careful artist quickly working out her subject with no purpose beyond it the other is an earnest impulsive writer who has aims quite independent of the evolution of the story itself the impressions left by the two novels are entirely different and yet who can believe apart of course from some distinct denial that  grantley manor would ever have been written had  emma never been read  there are differences and contrasts enough but the main thread of the story is precisely the same when emma receives jane fairfax into the house and more than half falls in love with frank churchill then finds out the mysterious understanding between her lover and her friend and finally marries old mr knightley as the best thing left for her to do she is but rehearsing the part which falls to margaret in the later novel there jane fairfax becomes ginevra edmund neville takes the place of frank and old walter steps in at the right moment to marry the young heroine turning now to the book before us we need not speak about miss austens life of which the first part consists as we reviewed it when it first came out it has now been enlarged and improved and though still somewhat slight is well and pleasantly written but the real interest of this volume consists in the unpublished fragments of jane austens writings there is a chapter ofpersuasion which was afterwards cancelled there are the first rough notes of the story she was writing when she died there is a short but complete story lady susan which is believed to have been an early production lastly there is the unfinished beginning of a novel to which the editor has given the name of  the watsons of course these fragments must be taken for what they are worth it was a natural wish on her nephews part that nothing of his aunts writing should be lost and so he has gathered together what he could but the responsibility is his alone and as he says censure if any  must fall on him who put it forth not on her who kept it locked up in her desk certainly jane austen would never have allowed anything incomplete or less good than her best to see the light still if these remains have not the literary value which attaches to her finished works they have nevertheless a value and an interest of their own they are only sketches but we draw them out from the portfolio of a great artist and find in them all that masterly touch which scarcely any other could have given even the cancelled chapter of persuasion the place of which was afterwards better supplied we should have been unwilling to lose as for the story on which she was engaged when the pen fell from her hand for ever it gave promise of ranking with her best novels the scene is laid at a little village on the sussex coast which two great proprietors are anxious to turn into a fashionable bathingplace one of these is an enthusiastic mr parker who believed that seaair and seabathing together were nearly infallible  nobody could catch cold by the sea nobody wanted appetite by the sea  nobody wanted spirits  nobody wanted strength they were healing softening relaxing fortifying and bracing seemingly just as was wantedsometimes one sometimes the other if the seabreeze failed the seabath was the certain corrective and when bathing disagreed the seabreeze was evidently designed by nature for the cure the other proprietor is a greedy old widow a large boardingschool is expected at the village and she remarks ah well no harm in that they will stay their six weeks and out of such a number who knows but some may be consumptive and want asses milk and ive two milch asses at this very time if only the story could have been finished what fun we should all have had with this old lady denham and mr parker and the invalid miss parker of whom her sister writes  she has accordingly had three teeth drawn and is decidedly better but her nerves are a good deal deranged she can only speak in a whisper and fainted away this morning on poor arthurs trying to suppress a cough  lady susan though complete in itself is otherwise of less real value than either of the unfinished stories it is in the form of letters which is an obvious disadvantage though formerly it was a method of telling a story which was much in vogue in spite however of sir charles grandison and of evelina miss austen herself distrusted its effect she recast sense and sensibility which was originally written in this form and she suppressed lady susan altogether the narrative instead of flowing easily and naturally along is given in a succession of jerks as now one and now another letterwriter takes up the tale it is difficult moreover so to vary the style apart from the substance of the letters as to give to each writer his own distinctive character and miss austen is less successful in lady susan than we had a right to expectfor when was ever letter written like that of mr collinss in  pride and prejudice nor is this story itself a pleasant one lady susan is a widow of doubtful reputation who is never happy except when engaged in a series of flirtations her young daughter is terribly in her way and she must marry her offhand a sir james martin is chosen as her husband but the man is a fool and the unfortunate girl detests him and will fall in love with a certain reginald de courcy meanwhile lady susan herself keeps up a sentimental flirtation with de courcy and at the same time a very violent flirtation with a married mr mainwaring de courcy fortunately discovers this double dealing and marries the daughter instead of the mother while lady susan stepping into her daughters place contents herself with sir james all this half rivalry between mother and daughter is disagreeable enough and lady susan is simply odious in spite of her beauty tact and fascination no woman however of her crafty and experienced worldliness could write so openly and so atrociously as does lady susan not only has she no disguises from herself but she affects none when writing to her friend and confidante here are two amiable examples of this excellent lady   my dear alicia in what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age just old enough to be formal ungovernable and to have the gout too old to be agreeable too young to die and again  mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever and were we at liberty i doubt if i could resist even matrimony offered by him thib event if his wife live with you it may be in your power to hasten the violence of her feelings which must wear her out may be easily kept in irritation i rely on your friendship for this but if we care little for  lady susan we care very much for  the watsons what we have of it was written in a moment of gay and happy inspiration why it was never finished it is difficult to imagine mr austenleigh suggests that  the author became aware of the evil of having placed her heroine too low in such a position of poverty and obscurity as though not necessarily connected with vulgarity has a sad tendency to degenerate into it and therefore like a singer who has begun on too low a note she discontinued the strain but surely this cannot have been the reason the watsons are at least as good as the bennets and tom musgrave is immeasurably superior to john thorpe as for the heroine herself she is more charming than elizabeth bennet or fanny price or catherine morland or any of miss austens heroines anne elliott alone excepted we suspect the real reason of this story remaining unfinished may have been that tom musgrave was too real a character and she shrank from what she would call  an invasion of social proprieties certainly tom mus grave if not taken from life is one of her most lifelike and vigorous creations the spoiled dandy of a country town with his insufferable conceit to thc equals who flatter him and lls unblushing toadyism to his betters who endure him he is simply glorious the ball at the hotel where he will not deign to appear till the osbornes come and from which he must retire when the osbornes go is capitally described and then what can be more delightful than his astonishment when emma refuses to dance with him or his disgust when she declines a seat in his curricle or his bewildered surprise when she will not admire lord osborne  he spends an evening with the watsons and condescends to play vingtetun with them  the favourite game at osborne castle and keeps them well supplied with anecdotes  the ways and good jokes of osborne castle were now added to his ordinary means of entertainment he repeated the smart sayings of one lady detailed the oversights of another and indulged himself even with a copy of lord osbornes overdrawing himself on both cards the clock 3truck nine while he was thus agreeably employed and when nanny came in with her masters basin oi gruelwas the father of emma watson we conder as particular about the thinness of his gruel as though father of emma woodhouse  he had the pleasure of observing to mr watson that he should now leave him at supper while he went home to dinner himself the carriage was ordered to the door and no entreaties for his staying longer could now avail for he well knew that if he stayed he would have to sit down to supper in less than ten minutes which to a man whose heart had been long fixed on calling his next meal a dinner was quite insupportable it is tantalising to feel that we can never know tom musgraves fate did he marry into the osborne set or fall a victim to some intriguing barmaid  the more painful  nd is we fear the more strictly probable this book then possesses singular aud varied interest it is well edited and carefully arranged to one thing only we must demur on behalf of some unsuspecting reader considering that  lady susan comprises only 88 pages out of 364 that the greater part of the book is the alreadypublished life we doubt whether the name lady susan c on the back fairly represents its contents we would commend the matter to either editor publisher or both as a case of conscience for them to ktiacide  a memoir of jane austen by her nephew j e austenleigh vicar of bray berks london bentley 1870 sense and sensibilitya novel by jane austen new edition london  bentley 1870 in the same sense that keats is the poets poet miss austen has always been far excellence the favourite author of literary men the peculiar merits of her style are recognised by all but with the general mass of readers they have never secured what can fairly be called popularity the technical dexterity of her workmanship is best appreciated by fellow craftsmen and some education of the literary palate is needed to do full justice to the delicate execution and subtle analytic power which give the author of emma an unassailable place amongst english classics it has always been known that miss austens private life was unruffled by any of the incidents or passions which favour the trade of the biographer  had it been otherwise the circle of her admirers fit if comparatively few would never have consented to wait half a century for the meagre but still interesting details which her nephew mr austenleigh has now made public it fits in with our idea of the authoress to find that she was a proficient in the microscopic needlework of sixty years since that she was never in love that she  took to the garb of middle age earlier than her years or her looks required and that she excelled in telling stories for children the few extracts given from her letters have the additional recommendation of illustrating the rise of the modern novel and the school of realistic fiction which fanny burney had announced though not founded at present the difficulties against which miss austens novels have to contend are the sententiously moral titles of pride and prejudice sense and sensibility the lengthy moral dissertations which the characters allow themselves and the consequent delay in developing the story the authoress on the other hand writes impartially of pride and prejudice  it wants shade it wants to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense if it could be had if not of solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story an essay on writing a critique on walter scott or the history of buonaparte or something that would form a contrast and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness and epigrammatism of the general style it would be difficult to ignore more completely the origin and the tendencies of her success but the passage shows the difficulties she had to overcome in the form of a preconceived theory the critics of the day were equally in the dark and one reviewer allows no merit to sense and sensibility but what arises from the exemplary behaviour of the elder sister it was not till after miss austens time that the domestic novel was emancipated from the theories of the amusing and the doctrines of the edifying which chill and stiffen miss edgeworths talent she was not conscious herself of founding a new school of fiction which would inspire new canons of criticism and in the mean time since she left tales of thrilling adventure to radcliffs and porters she could only claim a literary locus standi as a wit a satirist or a moralist to all of which characters she had of course a right though neither of them includes all the qualities with which we should credit her works these there can be little doubt would have been more popular now if the morality had been taken for granted and as much reliance placed upon dramatic and narrative truthfulness as upon the polished satire and the slight though pure thread of humour which runs through every work as a matter of art miss austens novels are more perfect than thackerays but they are far from containing as many separate excellencies  and her per feet command of the materials she possessed seems to warrant the belief that a wider experience of men and things would have enriched without corrupting her style as it isr she stands nearly alone amongst novelists in drawing men and women with equal success by the help of follies and weaknesses slight enough not to reduce their victims below the level of mediocrity mr austenleigh explains as a pure misrecollection the unaccountable secondhand description of his aunt found in miss mitfords correspondence since her mother on whose authority it was given is proved to have known jane austen only as a little girl the biographers task has been performed with care and judgment though certainly with less spirit than macaulay would have thrown into the memoir he once thought of writing the scantiness of the correspondence is however to be regretted and few specimens of unpublished writings would have added to the interest of the work thus where a wellknown passage like the end of persuasion exists in an earlier and less perfect form it is for the credit of the author that we should have an opportunity of comparing the two the new edition of the novels which is coming out does not appear before it is needed but the paper and type are hardly worthy of a series which is only

memoir of jane cameron female convict by a prison matron author of female life in prison in two volumes hurst and blackett jane cameron is a fictitious name and the prison matron has been careful to omit dates and modify details so as to disguise the identity of the heroine and her associates but this narrative as we are assured and os we can well believe is truthful in every important particular  a faith full chronicle of a womans fall and rescue it is a dismal painful book yet one that ought to be widely read and seriously thought over it has been undertaken with a view of showing  how the poor and ignorant are  led into crime and are in innumerable instances taught to  regard it as simply a business the evil nature of which  is to them not apparent and in that way to suggest  a  clue to the mystery of temptation and demonstrate to  philanthropists where the first effort should be made to  turn the weak and erring from the danger and this is done as well as a book can do it by the honest and eloi quent writing of the authoress of  female life in prison  the poor creature whose history is here told under the name of jane cameron was born in croileys land in the i new vennel glasgow a nest of tall buildings brimful of every description of vice so full that in one room alone some years ago it was estimated twelve robberies were on an average committed every week while in the moro respectable of the number it is common for fonr or five and often ten or twelve men women and children to eat drink sleep and live her mother rented one of these rooms with some

criminal and what is to become of him to lose sight of justice to the poor who are not criminal and who naturally may inquire wherefore the dishonest the unchaste the corrupt should be cockered and petted and have sympathy strained for them and bulwarks built round them while the honest the chaste and the wholesome folk who are the salt of the earth may die of want unless they blow their dismal trumpets in the street to attract people to the show of their misery suchto recall impressions or rather judgmentswere ours in regard to the prison matrons first book is her second one less genuine more made up  will not a third come in due course of time and a fourth  and so on till the records of low highway and byway crime in number outnumber the muses  some question of the kind must make its way when following this awful record of the career of an abandoned female creature rescued at last by a guardian angel the book is obviously a joint production its writer keeping herself in the background owns to having availed herself of male cooperation to verify localitiesto secure the details of the  seamy side of predatory life in glasgow nevertheless we cannot help asking whether she may not be in the foreground as the miss watton to whose experiences this tale must be owing it may not be unfit to restate an old argument of ours to ask to what extent the anatomy of profligacy by popular exposure in lighter forms than those of official inquiry justice and redress thrives so as to prevent the perpetuation of profligacy high or low an abuse is a great theme for a book which is to sell but in laying out its features do those who lay them out sufficiently remember that they are also laying out a path along which any one may walk no matter how high no matter how low a plain coarse path which any walker may follow to ftis oxen ends the dishingup of crime in fiction has been always amenable to thc comment of those who have sat at the banquet but in the case before us it becomes a little difficult to separate poetry to use goethes phrase from truth our  prison matron announces herself as having presented a story certain details of which she also announces have been mystified by her thus her book as it stands is neither fact nor fiction but what a booklet it be taken ever so lightly ever so critically ever so judicially what a tale of crime and sorrow and expiationthe life told from without of a female thief of a child cradled in infamy thrust out into the abyss of want later an unwedded mother when yet a girltaking to daring desperate hardened crime

the vicissitudes of commerce a tale of the cotton trade 2 vols saunders sc otley there is certainly an error in the title of this bookfor it neither relates to the vicissitudes of commerce nor can it be said with any degree nf strictness to be a tale of the cotton trade there is a broad distinction to be drawn between works of fiction and works of fancy the first when successful imply knowledge observation judgement and great resources of language the second are the daydreams of men and women whose education has enabled them to express in fluent phraseology the abstract notions they have formed of what is interesting and romantic to this latter class the work before us wholly belongs it is a mere sentimental story supported on a very slender basement of observation and incidents having reference to rather than drawn from the state of society in a lancashire manufacturing town there is of course a tyrannical and there is a kind millownerthere are a diabolical uncle a perfect paragon of a clergymana vulgar son and scheming daughters of the tyrannical millowner aforesaida heroine of miraculous beauty and perfection one maria st corse who is in reality the descendant and heiress of a family settled since the conquest in a rich county as is most usual in such cases  but who being compelled by the wicked arts of her uncle to enter a factory obtains in spite of her position and associates the honourable love of her employers son the attachment of these young people is the great theme of the book  and we must say that it rolls on with exceeding smoothness for the slight troubles which occur in the early part of the second volume are really so transparent as to give the reader no uneasiness at the outset of the story we began to think that a writer evidently aiming at fashion had at last been found to defend in fiction the marriage of a millowners heir with an exemplary maiden out of his fathers factory but we were mis taken that would be an enterprise we imagine as far beyond the notions and the courage as it is beyond the skill of the author of the present tale the vicissitudes of commerce bears many evidences of being almost the first production of a young writerand that writer we should think a female if our advice be worth anything she will pause a long time and subject her mind to a rigid discipline before she indulges herself with any more twovolume sketches of fancy and offers them as works of fiction,juvenile_contra

three faitgful knights too loyal to allow their disapproval of his crime to interfere with their chivalrous devotion and how in the end they were rewarded for their labours here is a good story of a different sort three impostors came to a xing and told him they were clothweavers and could fabricate a cloth of so peculiar a nature that a legitimate son of his father could see the cloth but if he were illegitimate though believed to be legitimate he could not see it now the king was much pleased at this thinking that by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed fathers from those who were not and so be enabled to increase his treasures for among the moors only legitimate children inherit their fathers property and for this end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture of this cloth and these men in order to convince him that they had no intention of deceiving him agreed to be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured which satisfied the king  when they were supplied with a large quantity of gold silver silk and many other things they entered the palace and putting their looms in order gave it to be understood that they were working all day at the cloth  after some days one of them came to the king and told him the cloth was commenced that it was the most curious thing in the world describing the design and construction he then prayed the king to favour him with a visit but begged he would come alone the king was much pleased but wishing to have the opinion of some one first sent the lord chamberlain to see it in order to know if they were deceiving him when the lord chamberlain saw the workmen and heard all they had to say he dared not admit he could not see the cloth and when he returned to the king he stated that he had seen it the king sent yet another who gave the same report when they whom he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth he determined to go himself  on entering the palace and seeing the men at work who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of the invention as also the design and colour in which they all appeared to agree although in reality they were not working when the king saw how they appeared to work and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described and yet could not see it although those he had sent had seen it he began to feel very uneasy fearing he might not be the son of the king who was supposed to be his father and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he might lose his kingdom under this impression he commenced praising the fabric describing its peculiarities after the manner of the workmen  on the teturn to his palace he related to his people how good and marvellous was the cloth yet at the same time suspected something wrong at the end of two or three days the king requested his alguacil or officer of justice to go and see the cloth when the aglacil entered and saw the workmen who as before describod the figures and pattern of the cloth knowing that the king  had been to see it and yet could not see it himself he thought he certainly could not be the legitimate son of his father and therefore could not see it ile however feared if he was to declare that he could not see it he would lose his honourable position to avoid this mischance he dmmenced praising the cloth even more vehemently than the others  when the aiguacil returned to the king and told him that he had seen the cloth and that it was the most extraordinary production in the world the king was much disconcerted for he thought that if the al acil had seen the cloth which he was unable to see there cold 1o longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of the king as was generally supposed he therefore did not hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill of the workmen who were able to make it on another day he sent one of his councillors and it happened to him as to the king and the others of whom i have spoken and in this manner and for this reason they deceived the ing and many others for no one dared to say he could not see the cloth things went on thus until there came a great feast when all requested the king to be dressed in some of the cloth so the workmen being ordered brought some rolled up in very fine linen and inquired of the king how much of it he wished them to cut l off so the king gave orders how much and how to make it up  now when the clothes were made and the feast day had arrived the weavers brought them to the king informing his maesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he had directed the sing all this time not dating to say he coild not see it  when the king had professed to dres himself in this suit he mounted on horseback and rode into the city but fortunately for him it was sumner time the people aeeing his majesty come 1 in thismanner were much surprised but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers kept their surprise to themselves fearing the dishonour consequent upon such a declaration not so however i with a negro who happened to notice

greatly troubled having x the will and not the power l now in the same town there lived another moor who held a r higher position and was very much richer than his father and 3 who had an only daughter the very reverse in character and appearance of the young man she being of so very violent a temper that no one could be found willing to marry such a virago b one day the young man came to his father and said you r know that your means will not allow you to put me in a position r to live honourably adding that as he desired to live an easy and i quiet life he thought it better to seek to enrich himself by an advantageous marriage or to leave that part of the country the father told him that he would be very happy if he could e succeed in such a union on this the son proposed if it were e agreeable to his father to seek the daughter of their neighbour in e marriage hearing this the father was much astonished and t asked how he could think of such a thing when he knew that no man however poor could be induced to marry her 8 nevertheless the son insisted and although the father 1 thought it a strange whim in the end he gave his consent the d good man then visited his neighbour telling him the wish of his a son i when the good man heard what his friend said he answered  by heaven my friend were i to do such a thing i should prove t myself a very false friend for you have a worthy son and it would i be base in me to consent to his injury or death and i know for cer tain that were he to live with my daughter he would soon lie or death at least would be preferable to life do not think i say t this from any objection to your alliance for i should only be too r grateful to any man who would take her out of my house the young mans father was much pleased at this as his son was so intent on the marriage all being ultimately arranged l they were in the end married and the bride taken home according i to the moorish fashion to the house of her husband and left to i supper the friends and relations returning to their respective homes waiting anxiously for the following day when they feared to find the bridegroom either dead or seriously injured  now being left alone the young couple sat down to supper i when the bridegroom looking behind him saw his mastiff and said to him  bring me water wherewith to wash my hands the dog naturally taking no notice of this command the young man t became irritated and ordered the animal more angrily to bring him water for his hands which the latter not heeding the young man arose in a great rage and drawing his sword commenced a savage attack on the dog who to avoid him ran away but l finding no retreat jumped on the table then to the fireplace his master still pursuing him who having caught him first cut off his head then his paws hewing him to pieces covering everything r with blood thus furious and bloodstained he returned to the l table and looking round saw a cat  bring me water for my hands said he to him the animal not noticing the command the master cried out  how false traitor did you not see how i treated i the mastiff for disobeying me if you do not do as i tell you this  instant you shall share his fate the poor little harmless cat i continuing motionless the master seized him by the paws and r dashed him to pieces against the wall his fury increasing he again placed himself at the table looking about on all sides as if i for something to attack next his wife seeing this and supposing i he had lost his senses held her peace at length he espied his horse the only one he had and called to him fiercely to bring him i water to wash his hands the animal not obeying he cried out l in a rage  how is this think you that because you are the only horse i have that you dare thus to disobey my orders know then that your fate shall be the same as the others and that anyone living who dares to disobey me shall not escape my yengence saying this he seized the horse cut off his head and hacked him to pieces and when the wife saw this and knowing he had no other horse felt that he was really in earnest she became dreadfully alarmed he again sat down to table raging and all bloody as he was swearing he would kill a thousand horses or even men or women if they dared to disobey him holding at the same time his bloody sword in his hand he looked around with glaring eyes until fixing them on his wife he ordered her to bring him water to wash his hands  the wife expecting no other fate than to be cut to pieces if she demurred immediately arose and brought him the water   ha thank god you have done so said he  otherwise i am so irritated by these senseless brutes that i should have done by you as by them he afterwards commanded her to help him to meat she complied but he told her in a fearful tone of voice to beware as he felt as if he was going mad  thus passed the night she not daring to speak but strictly obeying all his orders after letting her sleep for a short time he said to her get up i have been so annoyed that i cannot sleep take care that nothing disturbs me and in the meanwhile prepare me a good and substantial meal  while it was yet early the following morning the fathers mothers and other relatives came stealthily to the door of the young people and hearing no movement feared the bridegroom was either dead or wounded and seeing the bride approach the door alone were still more alarmed she seeing them went cautiously and tremblingly towards them and exclaimed i traitors what are you doing how dare you approach this gate  speak notbe silent or all of us you as well as i are dead  when they heard this they were much astonished and on learning what had taken place the night previous they esteemed the young man very much who had made

rechristen it on the tenterhooks that would equally describe the position of the characters in the book and the feelings of its readers the very first scene brings us into the midst of the excitement which is not to be allayed till the end of the third volume messrs read and boucicault can spare no time for opening descriptions for laying the groundwork of their plot for introducing us calmly to the persons of their drama these persons are thrust upon us one after another as they are wanted they are sketched in with a free and powerful hand and they uiver with what looks very much like life fader other circumstances they might possibly be real quiet breathing shapes needing but a touch to clothe them with flesh and blood but here they are given up to the exigencies of the plot and they must spend the three volumes of their life in planning desperate things and then doing them they are the ishmaels of fiction their hand against every one and every hand against them at times the wild tangle of plot and counterplot is too much for our endurance the jungle rises far above our heads and we merely hear the buzz of those voices which are whispering their secrets to their confederates forgeries upon forgeries spies upon spies villains who pass for honest men and honest men seeming to be villains double and triple disguises which are detected all at once superhuman ingenuity combined with the absence of the commonest precautions make up an atmosphere of their own in which the story moves and without which the whole would be a mirage of impossibility this is not the art which conceals art or that which looks like nature the book is a marvellous exercise of ingenuity and that is all it is a 3cene where the stage carpenter has triumphed fewer disguises and a little less complication would have produced a more artistic story we should not have been so much struck by the cleverness of messrs read and boucicault but we could have spoken more highly of their work as it is they have given birth to a curiosity but one which has no life in it it may be the talk of the season and so long as it is talked of it will be admired every one will remark that where other novelists have been content to tell how things were done messrs read and boucicault have done the things themselves we do not mean that they have actually scuttled a ship for though their description is vivid we can remember the trial at the old bailey which furnished them with the materials but instead of giving an account of the forged promissory note on which the plot turns they have given us though note itself we may compare every stroke and every letter with the genuine handwriting of john and arthur wardlaw evidently that part of the novel has been written by an expert we do not know which of the two authors has devoted himself for years to the study of handwriting perhaps mr read was working on this in london while mr boucicault was being wrecked on an unknown island in the pacific it may be the other way for all we can tell and the guesses we may make at the separate paternity of any one scene may merely show that we have no data to go upon yet we should particularly like to know which of the two authors wore a collar of rushes and stood up to his neck in water while making ducks his aerial messengers as for giving any idea of the plot that is quite out of our power we doubt if any one could take up all the links in their turn without missing some of them if we except is the original blemish of making robert penfold r succumb without an effort when he is tried for ie forgery there is nothing in the rest of the story ie that is inconsistent with itself but then this d consistency is gained at the cost of what would ie be much better the novelty imparted to the t book lies wholly in the incidents we have made the acquaintance of all the characters before they have the stamp of mr reades old creations too strongly marked upon them it is true that we see them in a new fight that the vivid flashes thrown upon them bring out other phases that their circumstances are different yet the statues in the vatican gallery when seen by torchlight are the same as those seen in the daytime and mr reades characters are always of the same type though their shading gives them another surface the convict in this book is innocent and the convict in  never too late to mend was guilty hut mr read follows the example of the world in treating them too much alike during the period of their sentence helen rolleston too reminds us constantly of mr reades former heroines whenever there is a chance of getting her in positions analogous to theirs the secret of this is that mr read rests exclusively on certain female characteristics and that there is a sameness in his mode of depicting them the caprices the selfdevotion the sudden inspirations the want of any sustained reasoning power which mark his women recur almost regularly in all his books his mannerisms of description appear to numb his observing faculties in this story too he is unduly weighted by a supersubtle plot we say  he without forgetting that another has a share in the work and no doubt a share in the characters but these traits of female character are the work of mr reade whether they are due to his hand or whether the two authors after becoming experts detectives shipwrecked mariners and diffusers of intelligence over a hundred leagues of ocean have ended by changing places bodies and minds with each other the scenes in the island though they are less credible than the rest of the book and though they tantalise us by the minuteness of their detail which retards the solution of the chief mystery are really the part by which the book will be remembered we turn back to those scenes with some genuine interest after we have sated our curiosity with the triple forgeries of arthur wardlaw and the spies employed by helen rolleston to track his spies to their master yet it is impossible to enjoy the description of the island when all the while we are longing to get away from it and we can hardly sympathise with those efforts which when successful will merely open a more arduous labour we have too much before us at once and the whole work is overloaded it is the natural result of this that the end should be tame and that when arthur wardlaw ends as one at least of mr reades characters has ended before we feel that there has been rather a collapse than a ddnouement,juvenile_contra

the celtic twilight men and women dhoula and faeries by w b yeats lawrence  bullen it was math the magicianthe same math that formed the maiden blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today mr yeats is perhaps the one true follower of math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his in it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of oisin and cuchulain and if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his the celtic twilight will still remain to the saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and fairies will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before but to those who believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,juvenile_contra

more successful novelists than men looking at the question from a publishers point of view considering that there are a dozen women who read novels to one man that most women like most men are lacking in imagination and therefore like to have things presented from their own the feminine point of view this fact does not seem remarkable probably scotts novels when they first came out were in less demand than those sweet works of letitia matilda hawkins and one can very well understand how those books which prophesy smooth things accept all the little social makebelieves and consider the convenances as if they were actually the revealed law may be more delightful to many people than those which set forth the grave and terrible realities of the world the solemn responsibilities which years bring upon us all the temptations which beset us the ambitions and the disappointments the inherent nobility of human nature the possibilities always open to the most fallen and the east importance of every single mans conduct to those who are associated with him making every allowance however for the people who read only to be made to laugh for those who have small imagination for those who like smooth stories of society and for those who like to read what may be called tales of the lower nature it has always been to me matter of great astonishment that the appearance of a novelist among us like charles read should not have been receivedi do not say with wider popularitybut with a more ready and more generous appreciation on the part of the critical press the truest and best distinction which a writer can obtain is the appreciation of the general reading public and it may be said of the novelist as of the dramatist that critics who may at the outset greatly help a new man cannot even if they try extinguish him critics for instance for a good many years went on trying to extinguish miss braddon but they failed and her books continue to rise in reputation they said all kinds of hard things about her yet she got a larger dlienlle with every new novel the reason was that the critics only saw certain obvious faults of style and failed to see beneath the style the genuine storyteller the real secret why miss braddon has succeeded is because she has always a good story to tell and has always told it effectively in fact there is good reason for the success of every novel that does succeed it may be in bad tastethe majority of mankind do not know good taste from bad it may be vulgarthe majority of mankind are themselves vulgar it may turn on forms of wickedness about which some people prefer not to speak but others love to read it may treat of the lowest depths like  lassommoir some people like to be in imagination among the very beasts of the people so that if a work of fiction be in demand it behoves the critics to discover what are the qualities which cause this demand now in the case of charles read we have a long series of novels every one of which has been successful and many enormously successful yet he has received from critics nothing more than the usual brief comment accorded to every writer of the least name as each novel was presented to the world i am not so foolish as to suppose that critics ever try to keep a man down here and there a malicious onslaught may be made but as a rule they seem to me a kindhearted and indulgent body there is however a wide difference between recommending one book after the other and forming a deliberate judgement on the position occupied by the author of many remarkable novels there exists perhaps among critics something of the sheeplike quality which makes them follow where one has had the courage to lead no one has yet led so that while we have been inundated with essays on the genius of george eliot miss thackeray and others i do not remember to have read one single serious effort to explain charles reades success to account for the popularity of his novels or to award him his place among english authors perhaps his success is not even known yet i believe that among those who do know it is perfectly well understood that of all living men who write novels he is the most widely known the most read and the most admired remember that there are the people in america in india and in our colonies to consider besides the subscribers to our circulating libraries in the quiet plantations on the coffee tea sugar and indigo estates on the silent sheep runs in faraway farmhouses in the states and canada and the colonies everywhere the men read novels here in this country there are more women readers of novels than men in the colonies men and women together all love novels and read as many as they can buy and if all englishspeaking readers were to vote for the best of living novelists there can be little doubt that they would name charles reade since the quartfrly revines have been silent therefore i should like to be allowed to state some of the reasons which in my mind have united in placing this writer in this position i wish be it understood to speak not as a critic but as an admireri am one of those who would so vote i entirely agree with the popular verdict i for one consider that read takes rank with fielding smollett scott dickens and thackeray that is to say in the great and delightful art of fiction wherein the englishwho are always in every age doing something better than their neigh bourshave surpassed the world charles read stands among the foremost and best first then he is a scholar this means among other things that he brought to the study of living man and woman a knowledge of ancient men and women he knew what to expect the forces which impel mankind and drive us hither and thither are and always have been the same necessity still rules those who speak english as she ruled those who spoke greek the same temptations assail us they are met with the same heroism or the same cowardice the way of the least resistance is always open to man and he generally to his discomfiture takes that way we change the sky but not the mind of man when we read aristophanes lucian martial and horace those have become already critics of humanity who have read these writers a liberal education of course means much more than thisdoes reades strong and vigorous style owe nothing to early compositions in latin and greek but this is surely a great deal before that great anatomist rabelais held scalpel in hand he had studied all that was written by the men of old on the human frame when filled with awe and adoration towards the maker of so wondrous a mechanism he stood before his subject about to penetrate the mysteries of the body he knew what to expect so he who would show the mysteries of action thought motive and desire should first have studied in the ancient schools it is a great injury for instance that we have done to women in withholding from them the liberal education in restoring it to them at their new colleges and high schools we have taken the greatest step towards putting them on the same level with men i believe that by means of likra humanios women will recover the critical faculty learn what is meant by style study epigram and perhaps cease to believe without reason it will be a strange outcome of this revolution in education if in twenty years or so the women novelists will write like read rather than like their predecessors of the present generation secondly charles read is a dramatist observe that the drama permits almost everything except verbosity and tameness a drama may have nearly every fault and yet succeed if it be lively and not verbose but the great majority of novels are verbose to the last degree without action and without incident if such a story as  griffith gaunt for instance be compared with almost any ordinary novel of the day the first note of difference will be found in the overwhelming amount of incident in the former as compared with the latter the second that the descriptions of persons scenery place voice gesture c necessary in every novel are much shorter in  griffith gaunt  than the other the third that the conversations do not drag and seem too long or discursive but that they carry on the action and develop the characters our old dramatists hung up a scroll on which was written  a room in the kings palace the actors by their dialogue and their gestures presently brought the place home to the imagination the spectators saw that splendid roomthey were actually sitting in it they were assisting at the council of the kings most excellent highnessthough the play was but on trestles in the courtyard of an inn slow brains saw nothing then as now if you give them the stage mounting of the haymarket they see no more you cannot by any means of upholstery tear out of himself for a moment the unhappy wretch who has no imagination now charles read in his novel work resembles the old dramatists if he takes his reader to a north country fishing village he does not make up an elaborate picture of the houses the boats the nets spread out upon the seashore the smell of the fish the narrow streets the reek and the dirt of it i do not say that in some hands such a description is not pleasing but it is not part of reades method he is not a painter of scenery nor of houses he does not care for picturesque  bits  and effects of light unless they help his story he is a painter of men and women therefore in the space of half a page or thereabouts he introduces us briefly to the kind of folks we are to meet and then sets them to talk for themselves not a bit of furniture not an inch of tapestry no blue china no cabinets yet when all is told and the curtain drops we know the place where the people live better than if we had read pages of description this is the art of the dramatist fielding who is also a great gossip and perpetually talking to the reader on his own account possesses this art his characters by their acts and their conversations reveal themselves and their surroundings for my own part i have always wondered how charles read could bear his novels to be illustrated except out of kindness to his weaker brthred i saw lately in a review the statement perfectly and literally true but actually made as an objection that read describes his characters from the outside exactly the dramatist describes his characters  from the outside there they are on the stage the king with his crown the soldier with his sword the priest with his shaven crown what more do you want presently they begin to talk and they show themselves as they go on building up their characters bit by bit or it may be revealing themselves in one or two masterstrokes the forciblefeeble writer describes his characters from the inside that is he tells you beforehand what he wants you to think of them this method helps the folk whose imaginative powers are weak it will therefore continue to be practised and to be in demand but which may we ask is the better art to make the characters reveal themselves or to describe them from the  inside looking therefore upon his story always as a dramatist considers his plot reade at the outset seems to have considered strength as the first essential in his work he aims continually at strength  he achieves strength in three ways first by a style which is always reined in nervous and vigorous in the purest english next by clearness of vision in his own mind you cannot draw a portrait when you do not see the face witness the blurred features of daniel deronda whose portrayer wrote round him and about him right through four dreary volumesor was it sixand left him as uncertain to the reader as he was to his biographer thirdly reades strength is achieved by his conscientious fidelity to truth not only is he true to his characters but he is trve to his plots i mean this there are so many complications possible in life that there is no difficulty whatever in finding the materials for a story but the artist must have story and characters to match he must have players who can play the parts and look the characters he must have a plot which springs naturally from the given conditions and does not appear manufactured the age the position the very names of his characters must belong to his story now all reades stories are strong and strong in their studied art which seems so unstudied many of them depend upon situations which in less skilful hands would be merely melodramatic in his they belong to the natural development of the plot thus  it is never too late to mend is one long series of striking incidents it is like a french play in five acts and cinquante tableaux there is material enough in it to make a dozen threevolume novels with the wordspinning and characterdrawingm which fill them out in  love me little love me long the contrast between david dodd and reginald talboys struck almost at the opening is a situation in itself maintained throughout with wonderful skill and success then is there anything more delicious than peg woffington pretending to be a portrait in triplets studio in put yourself in his place he covers the canvas with incidents he is prodigal of incident as becomes one who is fertile in devising situations continually new while in the short  wandering heir he has at least halfadozen situations all new and all strong one need not continue the list enough has been said to show my meaning that strength is the main quality desired by this author endless as are the variations which differentiate men so that the day will never come when the choice is exhausted the novelist who has studied his art has to remember that while many of the varieties lying ready to his hand are uninteresting he has to select for the purposes of his groups only those who will fall naturally into line with the rest and be able to take their part in the development of the story if you consider you will observe that read never introduces a needless character nothing more hinders a play nothing more endangers its success than a character not wanted reade as i have said before writes his novels as if he were writing a play scene after scene act by act the story advances what does not help the story along must be cut out and as in a play a man does not come on the stage with a paper tacked on his back describing his character but proceeds to show himself by words so in these novels every character shows who and what he is by words and deeds many weak writers can imagine vividly and can describe more or less what they imagine their characters to have done and why they did it reade on the other hand i repeat does not describe he makes his puppets act their own story and tell it themselves putting in only here and there the necessary explanation the canida jundmra which must never be beside the subject and must like the conversation advance the story he is not himself a narrator so much as a dramatist his works are almost ready for the stage his characters portray themselves strength truth aninationthese are three excellent qualities for a novelist to possess they will not be denied to charles read even by his enemies there is however a great deal more i have observed that he is a scholar and a student he says himself  wandering heir appendix p 305 i studied the great art of fiction closely for fifteen years before i presumed to write a line of it i was a ripe critic long before i became an artist my critical knowledge has directed my art but the practice of that art has not diminished my studies he has approached art therefore in the truest spirit that of a resolute student who knows that there is much to learn but is conscious of his powers i know no other example in history of a writer who deliberately proposed to become a novelist and spent fifteen years in preparation for his work the preparation was manifold in meditation about the quiet walks of magdalene in cultivated talk in the fellows common room in life among books in life among men in studies of french books and of francereades wide reading in french literature lends a flavour to his work which is as charming as it is easy to be recognised by those who also read french when he finally sent forth his first workit was i think  peg woffington a master in fiction already full grown stood before the world in another part of the appendix to the wandering heir he defines fiction as the art of weaving fact with invention if he goes on to say it were mere arrangement of fact thousands could write it the paragraphwriters and pennyaliners would become great novelists if it were pure invention the young would beat the older men out of the field but they do not because though they have invention they have not accumulated facts and they have no art dickens is the only great novelist who made an early success and there are many circumstances in his youthful history which account for that success let us therefore consider what is meant by the word fact he means that whatever be the story finally decided upon by the novelist it must be based upon a solid substructure of social life which must not be invented but be a faithful and truthful presentment of reality now the hardest thing in the world to get at is reality there are six hundred and fifty men in the house of commons hammering all night long and every night over what they call reality and the only reason why they do not agree is because they cannot convince each other of the real truth what then is the novelist to do he must go to all the available sources of evidence he must collect together all the undisputed facts and draw his own conclusions he must spare no pains in working out the problem for himself so far as the data allow and with no bias thus to illustrate reades method he found in the trades unions and the strikes with all the tyrannical cruelties and contempt of law and justice manifested in bringing the men within the unions an excellent subject for his pen he began therefore by collecting together arranging and digesting a solid body of facts he collected them from various local journals from blue books and reports very likely from visits to sheffield and other places and from conversations with workmen and their leaders when he had got these quite ready and not before he constructed his story now a story may lend itself to facts but facts cannot be got to accommodate themselves to a story there is the result howeveran actual presentment of a trades union a living chapter for future ages of this nineteenth century life all his books again represent life in action thackeray loved to sit at a club window and watch the procession along the pavement of old fogies old bucks old warriors old dowagers young dandies girls in carriages actresses gamblers brave young country lads admiring colonials and the rest who make up the world of clubs and of society reade who cannot be compared with thackeray because there is no single point at which they touch loves the life of action it is the brave workman fighting singlehanded against a union it is the young sailor handsome gallant and simplehearted against the man of the world it is the girl disguised as a man it is the wretched criminal struggling upwards to the level of self respect or the husband tortured by jealousy always real life with flesh and blood temptations and a hatred of hothouse and artifi ciality all his charactersyes allare men and womcn because if he flings a figure even for a moment on the canvas he finishes it with a few bold strokes and it remains a portrait not an uncertain phantom the true artist will not scamp any part of his work everybody is real everything seems to happen as it might happen to all of us even when the scenes are the most romantic and the situations are the most unexpected and this because he weaves his fact with his inventions so that one hardly knows where reality ends and romance begins and the novels taken altogether cover so wide an area that we may certainly accord to read the glory of being the chief painter of english modern life in its many forms from the belle of the season to the fishfag and from the peer to the convict i believe however that the great uninteresting stratum of life known as the  lower middle class  has been left quite untouched by him probably because he knows nothing of it he gathers his material where he can like moliere and shakespeare if he wants to write about modern times there are the daily papers the essays of the monthly press the bluebooks the pamphlets all kinds of things it he wants to write about the past there is the literature of the age to teach him some years ago an attack was made upon him on account of this very use of literature i would rather not speak of the trouble because the assailant is no more among us but one must allude to it in the story of the  wandering heir  the author had occasion to describe the gambling of a ladies party he went to that treasury of social manners and customs4swifts works and found in the wellknown  journal of a modern lady the ordering of a ladys whole day from morning to evening with the style of talk which went on he was accused of plagiarism and defended himself in a pamphlet which must be allowed to be a masterpiece of good english as well as of strong invective the following is the process as described by himself by which he handles his materials the perusal should be instructive for young noveliststhe first strata of facts i had to build my figment on were two reported trials in one james annesley was defendant on a charge of murder in the other craig v anglesey he was virtually plaintiff in a trial at bar for great estates and titles you will find the first case in  howells collection of state trials the second craig v anglesey is badly reported in howell i used the folio report published by smith  bradley dublin 1744 this book shall be deposited with my publishers that any novelist or critic who likes may see the use i have made of it the next source of fact was the amemoirs of an unfortunate nobleman written by james annesleys attorney upon the whole it is a tissue of falsehoods but there are a few invaluable truths in it the lies declare themselves trumpettongued the truths arc confined to james annesleys adventures whilst he was a slave in the colonies and his return home with admiral vernon i used a few of the truths and shunned all the falsehoods the memoirs being rather a rare book shall be deposited with my publishers for inspection in the three books i have now named lies half a plot but only iefntion of equal hwer with tah facts could make it a whole plot therefore i invented philippa and all her business and the whole sexual interest of the story i tell you this union of fact and imagination is a kind  intellectual copulation and has procreated the best fiction in every age by a law of nature to go into smaller details the irish schoolmaster and his  tall talk  are from facts supplied in print by carleton the irish curses i have used are culled with great study from three authors carleton banim and griffinand selected from an incredible number the decayed irish gentleman  the scornful dog who eats dirty puddings is fact taken from  a tour in ireland published 1740 to be found in the british museum the country costumes the price of salmon and other particulars are taken from the  postchaise companion in ireland  and  twisss tour in ireland the great salmon leap from  twisss tour in ireland the turf backgammon board with a boy for dice from oral traditionit was told me forty years ago by an irish gentleman who had it from his father the incomparable speech arrah people people c i had entire from the mouth of an irishman who heard it actually delivered in a fair the abductions and sham abductions of irish girls from ireland sixty years ago and sir j lubbocks  origin of civilisation c c in the other hiberniana of the story i have used the various histories of dublin and cork by gilbert and others the exrept anagwixm the  post chaise companion it ireland letters from a gentleman in ireland to a gentleman in bath rather an uncommon book and a very rare collection of old irish journals i obtained by groping that city for them the charning series of incidents in which john purcell figures are fom his sworn evidence and almost verbatim the abduction of the heir in open daylight is also sworn evidence see craig v anglesey the uncle beating his niece her flight to foreign parts and his apprehension on a charge of murder is a recorded fact i got it out of a chapbook but it has been referred to by jurists in my own day and i also possess it in a ballad called the  new west country garland  james annesleys adventure with christina mccarthy her shah penitence her cajolery and attempt to poison him were told by james annesley to his attorney and printed by him in  the memoirs i and i have set that gem of female nature in my story the discovery of james on board admiral vernons ship by his old schoolfellow matthews rests on the same basis of recorded fact the curious advertisement by jeweller drummond is an actual advertisement of the day taken verbatim from the gteaemans maguzine banker drummonds ancestor inserted it flizabeth shipleys character and her remarkable dream about wilmingtonthis and other vilmingtonia are condensed from ferriss  history of the original settlements on the delaware and from barkers i history of the primitive settlements but whatever in that part of the story bears upon the flagellation and other punishments of men and women and the legal relation of the planters to their white servants has been taken direct with careful study and precision from the various  charters and acts of assembly  of each separate state at or near the ulate of my story and here my method has kept me clear of the errors of james annesleys attorney who says in the memoirs that two of jamess companions were executed in the stakt of drlawart for elopement and suspicion of adultery now the law in that state inflicted no such punishment it imprisoned whipped and lettered it did not kill these colonies were hard upon religious offences but on the whole they did not take life half so recklessly as the mother country did at that time and with regard to sexual criminality they exacted such difficult proefs that their laws on that head were much thunder and little lightning the anglicana generalia have been culled with care from periodicals and books of fact too numerous to specify the masculine costume the women wore in the morning rests on addison amiss 7ournal the london yourna gcnat mans magaixc for 1730 daily courant and other contemporaneous authorities which are full of detail the entire reversal of female costume in the evening rests also on contemporary books periodicals and pictures lord angleseys levee and toilet are put together from alists 7ournal and various passages in the pictorial iistory of england in my novel of  a simpleton  there is a dressmakers bill 1872 in  the wandering heir  there is a dressmakers bill i got the modern dressmakers bill by asking three or four ladies of my acquaintance to oblige me with the original accounts they did so i was about to pursue the same plan in  the wandering heir when i found to my disgust i could not raise the dead so i had to ransack libraries  the graves of those who cannot diecrahk i found the truth i wanted in  the book of costume or annals of fashion by a lady of rank the parsot of colebrook charges the best bred ladies of his day with gross ignorance i fowid that in numerous authoritieslady mary wortley montagues letters mrs stones  chronicles of fashion and alas in my own family letters before and after that date as for their bad spelling that continued long after the date of the parsons observations other ladies spelled phonetically besides miss tabitha bramble hat in england and ireland the men drank hardest but the women gambled most i gained from essays and plays of the time how dublin gentlemen lived i got from  barringtons memoirs  ireland sixty years ago c and how a dublin lady passed her time i got from swifts photographic verses which carry truth as plainly written on them as livy and tacitus carry falsehood if i could have raised three ladies of dublin from the dead i would not have troubled swift but i cant raise the dead any more than mr home can and i have no personal experience of the year 1730 so i took the only remaining source of truth and interwove printed but reliable fact with my figment the possession then of scholarship which gives judgment taste and discernment strength of treatment clearness of vision fidelity of portraiture fidelity of incident the careful study of art the life of action truth in factsthese are qualities which seem by themselves to justify a place in the very first rank but there is still more i think as i have already said that the collected volumes of reades novels present a more complete picture of english modern life than can be found in the works of any other novelist there are separate novels by trollope hardy mrs oliphant sketches by laurence oliphant stories by miss mulock and plenty of others invaluable as pictures of contemporary manners and touching on portions of life outside the field of charles reade but not one has covered so wide an area or studied so carefully or represented so successfully the living moving struggling acting life i do not wish to set up comparisons between read and trollope or any other good writer to each his gifts it is however a very remarkable and suggestive thing about read that he cannot be compared you cannot lay hold of read here and of trollope there and compare their treatment he is absolutely unlike thackeray he bears no resemblance to dickens with blackmore hardy or george meredith the three who seem to me to come next to thackeray dickens and reade he has not one single point in common the impossibility of either comparing or classifying reade or of judging him from a critical point of view which admits any other writer is to my mind one of the strongest proofs of his excellence i propose next by way of illustrating these remarks to consider very briefly two of his works the first of these is one of his earliest christie johnstone it was written early in the fifties there was then as now a good deal of rubbish afloat among the uncritical that is to say the majority a few were trying to get art out of conventional groovesart of all kinds gets perpetually into grooves out of which it is the business of men with brains and clear eyes to drag it then there was a great deal of nonsense talked by certain followers of carlyle about mediaeval men and the decadence of modern times as if the present was not better than the past and there was a considerable quantity of ecclesiastical squabbling the meaning and importance of which is now happily quite forgotten and lost as is the way with this sort of foolishnessonly that more fool ishness of the same kind is always succeeding charles readei am not going to tell a good and wellknown story badlytakes his hero out of the city of babbledom right away

penal hand of a worthy mother the birch of the kindly dame who teaches him his letters and the canes of the masters who ground him in the three fundamental departments of learning is minutely set forth for the enlightenment of leaders who like to study the ways and manners of our poorer classes and for the entertainment of such youngsters as those whom the book describes the characters of johnnys schoolmates are delineated and contrasted with considerable ability and in his enumeration of the moral dangers that beset the humble but respectable lads of our large cities the journeyman engineer  gives us some noteworthy particulars concerning a vicious literature that is specially provided for their entertainment and injury but while the effects of cheap literature have been chiefly beneficial it has like other good things its attendant evils and chiefest among these in the present day is the extensive circulation of the kind of publications classed under the expressive heading of  thieves literature these works which are having a most pernicious effect upon boys in the working class rank of life are published in penny weekly numbers and at the commencement of their present runwhich set in soon after the abolition of the paper dutythey were published under such general but suggestive titles as black bess or the knight of the road and  the dashing highwayman general titles however were soon abandoned and these works now appeal directly to the class whose minds they chiefly corrupt by bearing such titles as  the boy brigand the boy piratethe wild boys of london and others of a like character the sole object of these works is the glorification of all descriptions of vice and criminality the boy hero is invariably represented as a daring and successful criminal leading a life of pleasurable excitement admired and obeyed by men beloved of women and eventually settling down with a rich and beautiful wife and the other rewards generally reserved for the virtuous heroes of ordinary works of fiction the whole tone of such publications ia eminently calculated to turn the spirit of adventure which characterises english boys to their own destruction as it teaches them to emulate not the deeds of great men but of notorious criminals the extent to which these publications circulate can only be fully realised by those inside the working classes and speaking from an intimate acquaintance with these classes i can confidently say that eighty per cent of the boys in this rank of life between eight and fifteen years of age who do read now read works of this class cases in which boys are led to commit robberies through the perusal of these publications are occasionally made known through the medium of the police intelligence but these are a very small proportion of the number of such cases that actually occur such robberies being for the most part from parents who do not as a rule make them public the depredations of the boys who are thus led into crime are committed either with a view to obtaining money wherewith to purchase the books or to carry out the lessons taught in them by setting up as  boy brigands or pirates on their own account and in connexion with this point it may be noticed that there is one feature in the publication of thieves literature that directly tends to induce the classes who are its principal readers to steal with a number of one of them the first two numbers of a new work of the same class is often  given away and these works being written upon the most intense  tobecontinued  principle the result of this dodge is that those who commence to take in one of these works are almost invariably involved into taking several others of the same class asit would beagainstthe nature of a reader of thieves literature to rest content without knowing the result of the  terrible encounter between the boy king of the mountains and the chief of the black bandits at the most exciting part of which the last of the two givenaway numbers of  the boy king of the mountains had terminated and thus it often happens that one boy is taking in five or six of these works at the same time and as the pocketmoney of workingclass boys is too limited in amount to allow of the expenditure of fivepence or sixpence a week in one article and the teaching of the works which they read is in effect that no boy of the least spirit would for a moment hesitate about committing a robbery these boys often resort to dishonest means to raise funds for the purchase of their favourite books what mr hughes accomplished for the boys of our upper ten thousand  the journeyman engineer has achieved for boys of our working classes,juvenile_contra

a 3 fivhe old friewls awal a young prinee by the author of the story of elizabeth smith elder and co our old friends have such very new faces that when we 1met with them in cornhill we should not have recognised them but for their titles externally and internally we now rfind them totally changed when we first knew them r they appeared in little books with paper covers procured not from the bookseller but at the toy shop afterwards we met with them printed in good bold type with grand illustrations rising from the page like the set scenes at a theatre now we are presented with them in an elegant volume sumptuously printed on toned paper handsomely bound with illustrations however which do no credit to all this luxuryfor to speak candidly they are simply hideous we are not prepared to say that our old friends are as much improved in reality as entertainers and e instructors as they are in outward appearance the fine  old fairy tales lose nearly all their poetry when reduced to fthe prosy level of everyday life and we feel convinced that the clever authoress would have given us far more i amusing stories had she trusted entirely to her own e imagination instead of trammelling herself for the purpose of producing a parody of our old favourites like the ltchildren of the present day who are apt so soon to lose h the charm of childhood and ceasing to be natural fancy li themselves young men and women these tales having lost their simplicity fail to excite much interest the new version is above the comprehension of children they 1 will not care for the love stories shorn of all their x wonders and yet their elders will be justified in voting the l tales as a whole too puerile to deserve their attention cinderella is the best she is still a little angel of patience i natural and charming and her surroundings are clever sketches of the life of today in  little red riding hood the grand tragedy is reduced to the level of a domestic drama what do we care about the dull life at fontainebleau which is in itself too bright and gay a little town too charming a retreat to be pitched upon ag the scene of such wearisome stupidity and then the moral which in the original is so clear that a baby can appreciate it is completely destroyed disobedience instead of meeting fwith condign punishment reigns triumphant certainly the wolf turns out to be no wolf at all but at worst a mere loupgarou but this is the authoresss fault and we cannot accept it as an excuse for rendering disobedience triumphant for proving that the young lady knows better than her papa and mamma a caution to them not to put the book into the hands of their daughters on the other hand jack the giantkiller gives us a fine moral leson of abuses remedied and oppression exposed by the disinterested efforts of an earnest activeminded man too energetic to fall into the jogtrot existence of ordinary clerical life and goaded to desperation by the apathy and coldness of his placid commonplace wife the story is more strange than agreeable the internal economy of an union workhouse does not present a pleasant picture for the fancy to dwell upon and if we attempt to console ourselves whilst reading of the cruelties and miseries by the reflection that it is only fiction we are soon unpleasantly reminded that such abuses and worse have been proved to have an actual existence and we cannot help fearing that they are still crying for redress in many a place where there is no jack to come to the rescue they are very correctly chosen as the type of the giant that devastates the lard the other two tales are the  sleeping beauty a description of the dull and vapid life led by many an english girl shut up in a dreary countryhouse with nothing to brak the monotony

it is desirable  to direct these faculties into a profitable channel it  five old friends and a young prince by the author of  a story of elizabeth witt illustrations smith elder  co the five old friends of this fresh and delightful book are the stories of the sleeping beauty in the wood cinderella beauty and the beast little red riding hood and jack the giantkiller but original thought and delicate literary manipulation have so completely changed the faces of these ancient friends and have imbued them with so many qualities of fancy and feeling of head and heart that whilst it is sometimes difficult to recognise in their actors the favourite heroes and heroints of childhoods romance it is still more difficult to state precisely in a few words how far they resemble and in what respects they differ from the narratives of which they are transformations a general and sufficiently exact notion of the authors aim and method may however be given by saying that she presents the moral lessonsor rather what her humorous vision apprehends as the moral lessonsof the old stories in a series of papers which combining the properties of the moral essay with those of the modern domestic novel preserve just enough of the incidents and characters of the original tales to remind the reader how beauty was found sleeping in the wood and how all the other personages of the marvellous legends accomplished the parts assigned to them in their respective dramas the wood of q the nursery story is changed into a dreary j w mansion in a stagnant district of a dull a english shire and its beauty is a heavyeyed nervous shy young woman who has been reared under a score of stupefying influences by an austere mamma and a mournful governess so that she enters her sixandtwentieth year with scarce a tithe of the intelligence and none of the joyousness appropriate to a person of her age and rank  a great many people observes the author moralising on poor cecilia lulworths education  think there is nothing in the world so good for children as scoldings whippings dark cupboards and dry bread and water upon which they expect them to grow up into tall fat cheerful and amiable young men and women and a great many people think that for grownup young people the silence the chilliness the monotony and sadness of their own fading i  twilight days is all that is required mrs lui j r worth and maria bowley her companion j s cecilias late governess were quite of this j t opinion they themselves when they were  c little girls had been slapped snubbed locked  s up in closets thrust into bed at all sorts of hours flattened out on backboards set on high stools to play the piano for days together made to hem frills five or six weeks long and to learn immense pieces of poetry so that they had to stop at home all the afternoon but though mrs lulworth had grown up stupid suspicious narrowminded soured and overbearing and had married for an establishment and miss bowley her governesss daughter had   turned out nervous undecided melancholy and j  anxious and had never married at all yet they i determined tobringup ceciliaasthey themselves  had been brought up and sincerely thought t they could not do better so poor cecilia is i drilled and stultified by unsympathetic treatment till she becomes a torpid creature whose life is nothing more vivid than one long sleep until her prince in the shape of a jolly and slightly impudent cousin wakes her up with a startling kiss whereupon after the wont of children abruptly roused from their slumbers she bursts out acrying at the dazzling daylight  such a thing never happened in all my life before said cecilia  i know it is wrong to cry but reallyreally but cecilia never relapsed into her old unconsciousness of the beauty and brightness of life for cousin charlie married her and she turned out a happy wife and mother cinderella is retold excellently and with greater closeness to the original story than any of the three following tales the ella of the new is no less exemplary and charming than the cinderella of the old version and capital fun does the reproducer make of ellas stepmother who  really was a beautiful young woman aud would have looked quite charming if she had left herself alone for a single instant but she was always posing and of ellas stepsisters lisette and julia of whom we are told that they  grew up into two great tall fashionable bouncing young ladies they pierced their ears turned up their pigtails and dressed very elegantly the dreadful narrative of little red riding hood is converted into a fresh and abundantly humorous lovestory the heroine of which finds her wolf in a suitable lover who devours without destroying her after he has gratified his natural voraciousness by gobbling up all her grandmammas objections to their marriage but the history on which the most labour has been expended is the record of jack the giantkiller who in the service of the church militant as country curate and subse quently as country rector does valiant battle with ignorance and poverty and gigantic evils arising from the laws delay or the laws abuse humorous literature seldom gives us anything droller or more just in the way of kindly satire than the portraitures of miss moineaux and miss triquett who gather subscriptions to thc fund for presenting the rev john trevithic with a teapot and strainer when these zealous spinsters have pushed their way into the narrators lodgings at sandsea they both sat down very politely as people do who are utter strangers to you and about to ask you for money of course the sum required for jacks teapot was raised and when it was inspected by subscribers at the silversmiths in cockspur street  it was a very handsome teapot as ugly as other teapots of the florid order and the chief peculiarity was that a snake grasped by a clenched hand formed the handle arid a figure with bandages on its head was sitting on the melon on the lid this was intended to represent an invalid recovering from illness for the particulars of jacks brave doings in the cause of workhouse reform in the face of opposition at home and slanderous calumnies out of doors readers must refer to the text which in places reminds us of what was strongest and most pleasant in the  roundabout papers  five old friends and a young prince it was mr james hannay who said concerning the genius of thackeray one of the best of all the things which that large  five old friends aii a youon prince by the author of the story of elizabetb c with four fliustrations by fr erick walker london smith eidcr  co topic has called forth in the way of criticism nawely that the great novelists mind had within it an ioipluvitum of poetry which kept it fresh though it contained no mighty fountain of song a more felicitous metaphor does not often occur and it might be used in speaking of the writings of the author of the story of elizrbeth she cannot be called an unworldly writer she has the same kind of quiet sagacity as her illus trious father her common sense wvorks in her writings as his did in his with all the fmrce if not with all the dignity of fate she is essentially of her time and always writing with the quiet pronounced accent of an english gentlewoman of the latest social culture and the highest social opportunities and yet the impluvitun of poetry is there it would be an interesting task to trace the movement of the qualities of air thackerays genius feniinized if such an ugly word may be pardoned to us in that of the fascinating writer whose book is now before us the vein of poetry in the daughter dips more towards those facts and influences which we are accustomed to sum up under the word nature than it did in the father it seems to us though the point is no doubt an open one that the cord of common sense is drawn tighter in her writings than in his not only weak minds but minds with a certain kind of force in them may occasionally feel as if the blood was ready to spurt under the constriction mr thackeray himself often made his readers or some of them feel like that in reading the writings of his daughter the same class of readers feel it none the less because her manner is so quiet again mr thackeray always impressed his readers as being distinctly qf the world he painted so wonderfullyyou could guess his position culture and social environment and it appears to us that as was to be expected you can do this with still more certainty in the case of the lady it may seem a necessary thing in the nature of the case that an english gentlewoman should write like one but except as to points of abstinence it is not so a good book does not necessarily give you the remotest hint of its authors social status or training a book of george eliots does not the best of mrs gaskells books do not all mr trollopes do and we are quite sure that the fact where it exists tends to limit an authors audience the bulk of mankind who are outside of the circle of a certain social culturewe were going to say cultfeel puzzled when its existence appears to be assumed as the necessary point on which to rest the imaginative lever one quality which mr thackeray possessed in a high degree that of the poetic naivetgis possessed in certainly not a less degree by the author of the story of eiizabeth it must be called a high quality for though its use on any large scale implies a certain humorous selfconsciousness it is distinctly affiliated to the simplicity of genius and no writer ever showed it consciously in his works who had it not in so great a degree that it also showed itself unconsciously in his life in the very beautiful stories now before us we have at the basis of the work the same kind of faculty as that which produced  prince giglio and prince bulbo  but while the hypo thesis on which the work is supposed to restnamely the natural origination and indestructibility of may we say fairyismmight prepare you to expect that large licence of fancy would be taken there is none taken at the same time the glamour or delicate threat of glamour is so well kept hanging over the readers head that he would not be surprised at the most im probable thing in the world let us suppose that we had all been accustomed to hear fairy tales recited or played by a fairyfied storyteller in a peculiar voice with peculiar gestures and with peculiar music between the acts then let us suppose somebody comes to us and adopting or gliding into the voice and maniere d6tre of the fairyfied reciter and repeating the music exactly proceeds to tell us stories of everyday life that is exactly what the author of these tales does and we feel ready to be tripped up at any moment by a touch of the old wand though the scene is laid in sussex or in brompton we are decidedly of opinion that the introduction with its theory of the natural indestructibility of the fairy tale is a mistake the effect would have been complete without this uncovering of the imaginative basis of the work or if not it might with a little labour have been made so that readers of the

lady make up an admirable picture the author of  mary barton  seems bent on doing for lancashire and the lancashire dialect what miss edgeworth did for ireland and scott for the land across the border there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,juvenile_contra
studies in board schools our library table by charles morley smitn jsilder k jomr charles morley s reprints from a daily paper a series of illu e mina ting articles on the london board schools  and in their collected form they furnish material for coming to a fairly de6nite conclusion about the value of the elementary system at any rate they present many of the salient facts in a concrete shape and serve conveniently as an indication of our national gains and losses mr morley has inspected a number of typical schools in various parts of the metropolis and by dint of keeping his eyes open watching everything that he saw in a sympathetic spirit and taking copious notes he has put together a serviceable and diverting if somewhat slangy report much of what he says might have been gleaned from the bluebooks of the education department but there is a great deal more which is not to be found in the official records incidentally he mentions the cost the number and variety of the schools the curriculum the quality of the teaching the characteristics of masters mistresses and parents  and in place of mere bald statistics he lets us see the interior of the hive and draws a thousand pictures from the life which are sometimes more informing because more familiar and unreserved than the reports of her majestys inspectors in brief these thumbnail sketches of board schools and scholars as they actually are show us the great citizenfactory of the nation hard at work with all its processes complete from the collection of the raw material too often rank and halfcorrupted an

will scud swiftly to fleet street and invest in evening papers here is one case and the boy who leaves a board school to become a high wrangler and a fellow of his college is another in which the i in national system is justified of its children is u1 the system justified throughout and on the m whole  it is safe to say that a very large d majority of englishmen in spite of certain strictures in regard to religious teaching and of certain misgivings as to the overeducation of the masses are satisfied with the general outcome of the policy adopted in 1870 the deliberate intent of the nation is that its poorest children shall be systematically trained to citizenship and that by the same means aided by a simple process of continuation the clever minority shall be trained to teach the next generation or to start on a higher commercial or technical career or if that is their bent to pass out by way of the universities as for the fear of overeducating the masses we share it in common with all highly organised nations amongst whom we were the last to accept a national system it may be that the danger is real and that the overeducation of individuals by cultivating their intellect beyond their natural gifts and in excess of their economic needs is not a mere unsubstantial chimaera so far as there is any force in this objection the evil may be and generally is counteracted by the wisdom of school boards and board school teachers out of a hundred boys and girls freely and compulsorily educated by the state there is let us say one who is lifted into the welltodo professional

alleviate their lot y amongst the remainder may be found a few we e doubt if there would be more than one in a i hundred who could accuse the state of having il unfitted them for a life of

mind here and there to reject manual labour or is domestic service because the board school a taught it the geography of africa and the e physiology of the frog discontent finds ar its own level and either ends in successor full striving or is a mere incident in a b general failure it would be well if the proas portions guessed at above could be more accun rately stated by competent observers after its twentyseven years of the school board it is he almost time to look for definite statements as ed i to what it has done or failed to do the man of letters is in one respect as competent m anybody to gauge the result of universal and compulsory education it has taught the nation to read easily and as a matter of daily habit the multiplication of poor readers has led to a multiplication of cheap books and periodicals and the stimulus has been manifested not merely in the production of schoolbooks which are printed at the rate of millions every year and of fiction which would naturally be first to cater for the new demand but also which ia peculiarly gratifying in a keener popular taste for literature the board school boy and girl are fed in school with illustrated readers and out of school with penny novelettes and picturepapers  and all this could not happen without largely recruiting the readers of genuine literature so marked has been the increase in the public demand for literary works that it undoubtedly goes far to account for one of the most noteworthy incidents of our recent literary development the enormous output of cheap and good reprints here then

vikram and the vampire or tales ot hindu devilrv adapted by sir r f burton edited by isabel burton memorial edition illustrated by e griset tylston and edwards sir richard burtons selection from the baitalpachisi is one of the strangest of fairy story books this old legend contained the germ of the  arabian nights and suggested both matter and form to such later collections of tales as the  decameron and apuleius  golden ass fantastic all of them gruesome many of them full of strange witty inventions their very grotesqueness fascinates while their applicability to modem times fills one with wondering mr grisets illustrations are altogether in keeping with the text sir richard burton translated freely he acknowledges  to remedy the conciseness of their language and certainly he gave them an attractive form  vikram and the vampire or tales of hindu devilry  adapted by richard f burton frgs c london  longmans green and co 1870 christmas is the time to welcome old friends with new faces but it is a question whether mr burtons adaptation of the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a vampire which first appeared in fraser should not rather be described as an attempt not altogether welladvised to pour the new wine of western criticism and humour into the old bottle of oriental invention w7ith the exception of a few modern and altogether foolish jokes such as  i love my love with an s because hes stupid and not psychological which do not harmonise with the ingenious paraphrases of hindu eloquence the book is decidedly amusing there are no weird horrors like those in the story of grettir and glam and the vampire himself is a goodtempered and rather engaging demon who executes the will of fate by slipping through raja vikrams fingers and having to be recaptured every time the raja is seduced into giving an opinion on the merits of one of the true stories which he relates in succession these are of varying interest and complexity the worst being the only one literally translated  but in the others it is easy to distinguish by internal evidence the modern gloss from the original framework of the tale the episode of the apple of life in the introduction is one of those which found their way from oriental collections into the gesta romanortttn and the vampires third story contains the rudiments of the favourite german character der getreue johannes the fifth story which recalls portions of the forty thieves suffers from the editors attempt to give the modern equivalent for the lingo of the hindu scripture chanriyavidya or thieves manual the best illustration belongs to the seventh story and represents a quadrupedfrankenstein a supernatural tiger destroying the wagners who created him  but it is one of the incongruities of style before complained of to make the guru  a physiologicophilosophicopsychologicomaterialist a jayasthalian who had become convinced  that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself the problem which finally poses king vikram is to find the relationship between the children of a father and son who have married a daughter and mother but this is introduced by a pseudoprophetic description of the white outcasts who will one day conquer india which is not much better than is common to this hackneyed form of satire the chief use of the volume besides dispelling unpleasant associations with the name of vampire will be to familiarise the run of readers with hindu methods of thought and expression and to show the tie of aryan brotherhood strong through all superficial discrepancies m octave feuillet could not improve upon  no one knows the ways of woman  she kills her husband and becomes a sati suttee  and the proverb  hauta pandit sansara alas the world is learned  breathes a depth of spiritual exhaustion such as we are apt to fancy peculiar to later ages h lawrenny  vikram awl the vampire or taits of hindu de vii ry adapted by richard f burton with illustrations longmans  co it is somewhat strange that the indian tales entitled  the twentyfive stories of baital and the thirtytwo stories of the throne have not become better known in europe the baital pacbisi and singhasan battlsf such are their indian names are household words in hindustan they truly reflect the customs and superstitions of the hindus and they contain some poetical touches and a great deal of capital horror of the monk lewis and der freischutz school sometimes there is an approach to pathos as in the story of the rajput family who devoted themselves for raja rupsen their chief excellence however is in the description of lonely cemeteries and incantationscenes which latter are quite equal to that where the wild huntsman of the hartz mountains makes his appearance capt burton therefore has a theme of some promise in its peculiar way and he is the man to make the most of it but it is time to explain the meaning of baital pachii vetiilab in sanskrit is a sprite or goblin haunting cemeteries and inhabiting dead bodies in hindi the word is baital such a being is the narrator of the twentyfive tales which have become one of the popular storybooks of india and the way he is brought on the stage is as follows  the father of vikram king of ujjain a city in central india has incurred the resentment of one of those hindu saints who seem never to be aroused from their heavenly meditations except to deliver an anathema on their fellow men gandharbasena vikrams father is cursed by the saint and dies and the saint then plots the destruction of vikram he is the more confirmed in his design as it so happens that vikram who is the indian king arthur was born at the same astrological period as the saint as was a third individual the son of an oilman who in some way we are not told how but probably by penance obtains though sovereignty of the infernal regions and fate has decreed that whichever of the three can murder the other two will become a universal monarch the saint who by the by is the son of a potter murders the oilman and suspends his corpse in a cemetery head downwards from a tree where it becomes the abode of a baital or demon the saint then comes to vikram in the shape of a handsome young merchant presents the king with rubies of inestimable value and asks him to attend a sacrifice which he is about to make to durga the goddess of carnage intending when vikram prostrates himself before the goddess to strike off his head vikram however has been warned of the treacherous design by a giant whom he had defeated in single combat he goes to the sacrifice with his son and is told by the ascetic to bring the oilmans corpse from the cemetery where it hangs in spite of horrible apparitions which are sent to deter him vikram cuts down the corpse when the demon who inhabits it tells him he will consent to go with him only on condition of his not speaking he then tells the king as he is carrying him twentyfive tales and at the end of each puts a question so artfully that vikram is twentyfour times betrayed into answering whereupon the corpse slips from his grasp and resumes its hanging posture in the tree at last when the twentyfifth story is told vikram maintains silence and the demon now instructs him when he is commanded by the saint to prostrate himself to request his holiness to show him how to do so and to strike off the head of the ascetic as soon as he bends baitiil then departs from the corpse which vikram carries to the saint whom he decapitates as directed capt burton has selected the first second third fourth sixth ninth tenth thirteenth fourteenth twentyfirst and twentyfifth stories and of these he has translated the tenth literally and the rest freely his eighth story which corresponds to the twentyfirst of the hindi is largely supplemented and there is among the insertions an excellent account of hindu philosophy capt burton makes no mention in his preface of a former translation of the  baital pachisi by mr burckhard barker which was edited by mr eastwick in 1855 we will only further observe with regard to the note at page 36 that persia is one of the countries in which a hog is stabled with horses to avert calamity from them at page 41 we suppose witches should be read for bears as da in is the word in the original and this at page 70 is properly translated  witch,juvenile_contra
