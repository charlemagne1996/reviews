vzctzon i castles in the air a novel by mrs gore in 3 vols london 1847 the defect of this novel is its entire want of originality mrs gore has failed to produce a new feature in her plot or a new character for her actors the theme is the stale one of a narrowminded illbred fool suddenly made rich and a representation of the follies and meannesses and wickedness which such a personage will commit when a power is placed in his hands which he has not the virtue or the discretion to wield then has mrs gore chosen the form of autobiography and made this wretch henry wrottesley tell his own tale but the mask is so ill worn that in every page we are reminded that it cannot be the writing of the illbred man whose tale it professes to tell but that it is mrs gore speaking in his name and this conviction mars much of the pleasure of the tale we are obliged to recognise it as afiction whether we desire it or not how mrs gore has contrived so to familiarise herself with the sayings and doings of such a set as are here depicted blackguards and blacklegs and the scum of society is really astonishing and this she does well and truthfully but as a whole this novel although better and more readable than many that the season has produced is not worthy of mrs gores reputation we fear she is writing herself out,englishfiction
110 thinks i to myself a serioludicro tragicocomico tale written by thinks i to myself who two vols 1811 sher wood and co there are few of our readers it may be presumed to whom a little recollection will not bring the situa tion in which the spectator describee himself in the passage of no 12 where the circle of girls are drawn round the fire relating anecdotes of ghosts and hobgoblins  as well as the distinct character he gives of him self in no 550  it is very well known that i at first set forth with the character of a silent man  and i think i have so well preserved my taciturnity that 1 do not remember to have violated it with three sentences in the space of almost two years by this means my readers have lost many good things which i have had in my heart though i did not care for uttering them upon upon whatever grounds the author of  thinks i to myself formed his character we can have no hesitation in declaring that he has produced a most entertaining and we should hope instructive tale calculated by laughing with good humour at the follies and absurdities of the day to exhibit them in such a light as that nil may proht by his admonition the language is in general very neat and appropriate and not unfreqiienlly reminds us of the facetious writings of sterne of whom it has beeu ob served that no writer was ever more calculated to make forcible impres sions upon the minds of the younger eatt of the community this rcseiulance to sterne is apparent to us at least in various passages but per haps the conversation between the father and the son which we shall presently introduce as a specimen of the work will be found equal in true point and humour to any of thfc most popular passages of that entertaining writer sot however to detain our readers longer in limine we shall place before them the outline of the tale which these two volumes com municate and it is simply this hob dermont the hero of the story is the son of a gentleman tole rably well provided for in worldly affairs but unfortunately and con trary to his wishes with the expecta tion of a title without an adequate estate a considerable landed pro perty however is contiguous to that of old mr dermont which belongs to the descendant of a very rich to bacconist the idea very naturally presents itself to robs father that by marrying his son to his neighbours heir an only daughter things will goon smoothli aud an income re sult sufficient to support the title the family of the twists are on their part equally solicitous for such an alliance and not a liltlv delighted with the idea of connecting themselves with a little bit of blood as ill luck will have it the rich miss twist is both uly in her person and not very captivating in the charms of her mind whisl ei ily

if sinners entice tltee by william lo qucux white  co ir is impossible to regard this novel as satisfactory of course mr le queux writes well when he describes life and scenery at nice and on the riviera for as we have remarked on other novels written by him he is painstaking and careful unfortunately his last published work suggests that ho has devoted his enorgy to though manufacture of artificial personalities who move like puppets through a conventional drama there is a mysterious murder at the end of the second chapter though heavy father of the early victorian stage is found fortunately only on his doathbod the conventional foreign nobleman duly appears as the complete villain and the virtuous love of a young man and a maiden is ultimately rewarded with marriage title and money one seems to have read it all before many a time from 4 the woman in white to the day before yesterday and yet the familiar dish is by no means badly served the gamingtables of monaco and the gamblers last stake are at least as well described as we have known them of old and a reference to the yachts britannia and ailsa shows how recently the picture was painted it is not quite clear why the villain should be described as having an arrestive face for the epithet adds nothing to our appreciation of his familiar features the minor characters are unusually well sketched we shall hope to see a better story from mr le queux in the near future,englishfiction
the portent a story of the inner vision of thc highlanders commonly called the second sight by george macdonald smith elder  co there was no need for the semiapologetic preface prefixed by mr macdonald to his romance there is no style of novel gone by beyond the power of rehabilitation a straightforward good ghost story would be just as acceptable now as were  the mysteries of udolpho and the family of montono jn their time  though in both of those books the error was committed of not implicitly trusting to the supernatural but of explaining away the terror what can exceed the fascination of wandering willies tale in  redgauntlet we had no particular liking it will be recollected for the  strange story with its subtleness of  fate and metaphysical entanglement but the scene of the raising of the dead at derval court held us as fast as the ancient mariner held the wedding guest mr macdonald does not rise to the height of radcliffe or maturin or scott or sir e lytton but his supernatural romance is nevertheless a thrilling gtory the defect a grave one is that the heroine u not distinctly present to us neither do we see why at last she should be extricated from the thraldom spiritual and temporal which so long hung over her if mr macdonald intends to make further excursions into the land of shadows he will do well to recollect that the darker the clouds above him the longer the vistas of vapours on every side the greater is his own need of a firm footing a vigorous grasp on the fear of those whom it is his purpose to enthral owing to vacillation he just falls short in  the portent of effecting his purpose yet the story as it stands has merit of no common order,englishfiction
a diplomatic woman short stories by huan mee  sands  cothe pseudonym adopted on the titlepage of 4 a diplomatic woman  probably conceals a brace of authors on the cover is depicted a woman and it is as ugly a decoration as anything in bookcovers we have lately seen and that says much six stories within tell of six different adventures in which this singularly plain parisienne is involved she is supposed to be a reigning beauty and to be in the confidence if not in the pay of premiers ministers attaches and suchlike persons the episodes are recounted in the first person and the tone and manner are unfortunately not calculated to give the wished for impression of elegance and distinction french quotations and expressions are numerous but many of these are more incorrect or less well applied than should be the case in high diplomatic circles the intrigues are now and then ingenious but entirely charmless always bad characters abound in the volume entitled the naked trwh und other stories by andrew merry new century press and leave a distinctly disagreeable taste behind them there are five of these stories and they are clever and suggestive of careful study of the best french models of the day it is not easy to avoid the impression that sombre subjects are more suited to the writers pen than those of cheerful characteristics the first one which gives its name to the collection describes a married woman and her lovers one of whom cannot understand why there should be others besides himself and he cannot see that he is neither the first nor the last he neglects his wife and drinks no doubt there are many such men and women and their story is not new to fiction however it bears retelling and it is well told the rest are not unlike the first piece in subject and treatment they describe the lives of those who dwell in cities especially the more unhappy of them perhaps the writer would be equally clever in describing happier things  and if so some such feature would hardly be out of place if only by way of contrast,englishfiction
jack and three jills0 there is a good deal that is clever and more that is amusing in these two neat volumes which in their sober dress of plain red sides and salmonpink back appear to aim at looking like fiction in handyvolumeclassics1 clothing the reader will probably be sufficiently interested to read them through from cover to cover having done so he will probably wonder why he took the trouble as there is no particular plot nor any remarkable excitement and there is a perceptible though perhaps not easily defined flavour of vulgarity about the book not that the characters are vulgar people jack who by the way is george for the first seventy pages is evidently meant to be a sort of pelham written up to date who succeeds in life because somehow he cannot help doing so who belongs to the best clubs and moves in  county  and other very superior society but somehow we feel him to belong rather to bayswater or bloomsbury than to mayfair while yet we are ready to confess as mr russell lowell does in one of his pleasant essays that we tremble before the effort to define the vulgarity of which wre are conscious the fascinating widow or grasswidow with a past which is not a favourite subject of conversation who is the first of the three  jills is a good sketch and the relations between her and jack are capitally described jill the third the american heiress whom mr severn the successful and very selfsatisfied hero ultimately marries is also a very nice girl indeed her father cyrus napoleon washington q rock belongs to the tribe of gilead p beek he too has made his pile and by means of those wonderful oilwells which as mr rock explains providence for its own reasons has confined to the united states  jack and three jills by f c philips 2 vols london  ward  downey he is a good sketch of the shrewd drilyhumorous american selfmade man who has a proper respect for dollars without being in the least purseproud he likes literature and art he enjoys modern paris much and old london even more rummaging out every famous old spot with intense delight his daughter is an american girl of the good sort to prove whether jack severns affections were truly for her or for the dollars mr rock gives out that he is ruined jack however comes triumphantly through the ordeal and we are glad that the bells ring for his wedding with elizabeth rock and not with jill number two the rather vixenish lizzie vivian who swayed his heart for awhile the book will not bear quotation  its merits lie in the ease and fluency of the narrative the brightness and entrain of the style and a certain freshness in the sketching rather than drawing of the characters in the cheerful little drama its worst blemishes are faults of taste which collectively become distinctly bad taste and are to be regretted,englishfiction
israel kalisch by w l george constable 6s it is not a necessary fault to a novel that it be a tract some of the best of novels have been tracts as for instance one of our conquerors anna karenina crime and punishment jude the obscure the question is what sort of a tract is it if anna karenina had been a cushion on which the objectlesson was thumped instead of being a living soul who demonstrated it in her vitality her book would still have been a tract but it would have been no more and in israel kalisch its eponymous hero is less a living soul than a convenient cushion not that mr george identifies himself with his sermon that need not be the jewish lad who grew to a man of striking appearance flaming red hair and beard pale skin and wonderful blue eyes who by his large idealism and quick sympathies things always anarchic in their tendency became an active anarchist and finally met his death by the misthrowing of a bomb may not hold mr georges views and it does not matter whether he do or do not the point is that he is more a lay figure for these views than a recognisable soul of whom they are an integral part the other characters in the book live though they are rather distinguished by their description and by the employment of certain phrases and actions than by a real difference in personality but they and kalisch live as it were by reason of their environment and the strength of mr georges book lies in his depiction of that environment that was so in the city of light it is even more so now he describes evidently as the result both of fairly wide experience and painstaking examination certain aspects of cosmopolitan life in new york and london where israel lives his life struggling painfully that it should be lived and seeks to understand the wretched pattern that society in its cowardice and avarice has made of life men like leidunvitz and warsch women like sonia and even karsavina whom israel saves from suicide and who loves him wildly for his idealism and personal beauty are like points where that environment has uttered itself in an expressive symbol the dirt and poverty that being in a nonenglish atmosphere do not necessarily degrade the fierceness of those that are ground down the strikes that fail the desperation that this inevitably engenders the curious sense one of the most remarkably accurate things in the book of getting outside the english classstratification in the very midst of an english system  are all faithfully presented it is more than photography it is more than stereoscopy for there is atmosphere and yet the book fails in a literary sense and not only because the style is without form or value it will be read however and it will have its effect for it is good journalism  5rail kalisch iby w l george 6s conbtalble there has been a definite  purpose  in each of the two earlier novels which mr george has written but neither in  a bed of roses  nor in he city of light  was the essential motif so insistently obtrusive as it is in this study of the life and death of an intellectual anarchist from its very nature the story is one of sordid life on the continent in new yqrk and in london but the sordidness is merely that of the material circumstances in which the characters live and the tale is saved from being  unpleasant  in the shavian sense of the term by the subsidiary loveaffairs of several of the characters and in particular by the devoted passion of karsavina for the hero israel kalisch the conception of israel kalisch is firstrate while he is thoroughly sympathetic with his hero mr george is not unduly carried away by his creation and he uses kalisch very skilfully as a foil to other of his fellow anarchists the book indeed is extremely clever mr george has the gift of being able to put a political sermon or rather a political debate into the form of fiction without either destroying the value of his real thesis or obtruding the teacher too much upon the storyteller and so long as he retains this power he will be read with interest by people to whom most of the views held by his characters are utterly obnoxious,englishfiction
white fire by john oxienham hodder  stoughton os when mr oxenham decided to write a missionary story he did himself an injustice in imagining that he could make a good one his failure proves not that he is no storyteller but that his versatility has limits he ha used all the oki stage properties the good little boy working at euclid and latin while tendingkis beasts on a scotch hillside  the little girl delicately nurtured who meets him at the age of thirteen and receives an indelible impression the good elder who helps the herd laddie on his way  the whitehaired missionary hero all are here and how dull they are 1 they have done duty so often that they are how like battered woodblocks and only printblurred mr oxenham tyres of them himself early in the book and the story that was to be a missionary tale becomes instead quite an exciting yarn of adventure only held in check by occasional regrettable scruples the missionship carries a long tom and a welldrilled fighting crew and behaves to all intents and purposes like a good old rumbustical pirate always of course using violent means to a saintly end in fact the book is the stage of a pleasant little comedy in which mr oxenham the writer ol gallant intricacies of adventure plays and parries with that other mr oxenham who is determined to do the missionary story with becoming zeal and pie tv neither adventurer nor missionary has the stage to himself consequently though parts of the book belong to a bad missionary tale the rest seems to be made up of slices from a wellflavoured adventurous romance the two do not dovetail very well,englishfiction

ficti ion sons of the morning by eden phillpotts methuen 6s we have ere now frankly expressed our conviction that mr phillpotts is a writer of exceptional gifts we have also noted his tendenoy towards mere excitation sons of the morning is a novel which bears out both our encomium and our disparagement it is finely written it has some of the qualities of a stately nature poem but its function is  mere excitation at first the book seems to offer an interesting problem in human affairs honour endicott loves two men of contrasting temperaments at the same time and in the same way we are accustomed to the situation when the person whose affections are divided is a man but a woman of this sort of versatility is a little uncommon and in devonian scenery with pious rustics babbling around her more than a little piquant one asks whether the heroines dual passion will make her a genius or a mad woman a social iconoclast or a saint but mr phillpotts simply cuts the gordian knot shaking nrieti s revive at the stroke of death but the reader ps we have here touched the salient spot of improbability as well of futility in a volume that is by no means deficient in that ingredient there are in it things far more extraordinary than the death of a husband by a fall but it may be said with perfect truth that to sustain conviction in a story it is necessary that all catastrophes of fundamental importance should seem as well as be inevitable great writers successfully compel the illusion that they are mouthpieces of reality mr phillpotts is self betrayed as the mouthpiece of mr phillpotts it is so in the conclusion of lying prophets it is so in sons of the morning and yet his cunning is indisputable he can write lyric prose and make his beautiful devon live in a manner that causes one to feel that whatever their misfortunes his two lovers were veritable  sons of the morning it has been said that merely to insert marry come up is a step towards creating the illusion of an historical romance so too does a word like toadflax help to create the illusion of a country romance mr phillpotts has planted his characters on real soil the sense of growth and space is over his story and he can use rightly the names of many wild things besides toadflax strong is he too on the side of local colour his witch is a fine invention though the machinery of the story would creak less if he had never reverted to oil of man his rustics who revolve about honour as mr hardys did about bathsheba a greater creation are always amusing this is the way in which churdles administers consolation to the father of a stillborn babe  beggin your pardon theers a gert lesson to such a trouble if a body cant be tu stiffnecked to see it it do teach us worms o the airth as even god amighty have got a pinch of something human in the nature of unas ive allus said for that matter this here shows how even he can alter his purpose arter a thing be well begun an bant shamed to change his everlasting mind now an again moren the wisest of us theers gert comfort in that if you please if mr phillpotts will strive towards organic perfection perfection of form and mechanismhe may do something great  s0n8 of the morning by eden phillpotts this is such a fullblooded story of the west country au was to be expected from the author of the children of the mist a single illustrationa capital photographic view of seor hill circle and watern torquietly gives the reader his first sense of the background and atmosphere of the ttory from this we turn by chance to page 457  far below them in fulvous light of a wild sunset the circle of seor hill appeared concerning the memories its granite girded christopher knew little but at sight of waterns crest now dark against the flaming sky he remembered that there lay the scene of stapletons end and regretted that he had come within sight of it that night to him the distant mountain was a theatre of tragedy to honor an altar of saorifioe the hero and heroine are each the last of a line the final fruit of an ancient stock methuen 6s  sons of the morning by eden philpotts 6s methuen mr philpotts is in danger of taking himself and his work too seriously this tendency only too marked in 1 children of the mist is still plainer in  sons of the morning we confess to having found much of mr philpotts new novel sadly wanting in attraction and brightness it contains not a little excellent writing nothing could be more humorous than the rustic scenes while the descriptive work is good though there is too much of it but failure is in the central figures they are stiff and unreal not convincing enough to win our sympathy besides to make matters worse the story never ends it simply breaks off leaving the heroine in blank despair true she deserved her fate but that is small consolation for the reader a woman of a type happily abnormal she was violently in love with two men at the same time hence of course complications follow which we do not propose to reveal if the reader chooses to unravel them he will be rewarded by some diverting studies of devonshire yokels in which mr philpotts returns to his old saner merrier self the problem novel may not yet have had its day but the problem novel without a real problem certainly has  sons of the morning by eden phillpotts methuen  co ix spite of certain attempts at preciosity and a too obvious searching after strenuous words this author has a vivid style and a powerful grasp alike of human nature and the moods and phases of what in comparison we class as inanimate it is a pity there should be this tendency to mannerism that words like dislimn and  hypeethral should appear in contrast to such grovelling modernisms as  a wage because without them the descriptive passages would run the smoother and no discord would interfere with our enjoyment of such wordpictures as those of seor circle and watern tor the moods and phases of dartmoor have seldom been better described and the scenic setting is ever appropriate to the action of the drama which is played by the dwellers in and around bear farm honour endicott the last of her ancient yeoman race is an orphan maiden who rules her labourersa reasonably rustic and humorous set of originalsand orders her acres with sympathy and intelligence when there comes upon her as the result of neighbourhood from childish days the love of a sentimental and affectionate young squire who is not gifted with strength of character though she sees his weaknesses honour genuinely returns his attachment and all goes well till the arrival of myles stapledon her cousin to stay at the farm to which he is to contribute the assistance of his capital and skill myles is a com plete contrast to the young squire grave sensible and anxious he is a man with depths and heights of feeling unintelligible to the aesthetic but rather shallow nature which soon suspects him as a rival honour partly appreciates himso far indeed that when taxed with her lingering love for the squire who has departed in a moment of generosity to leave the coast clear she frankly says she loves both her suitors what the denoilment is

the soul of lilith by miss marie corellt 3 vols richard bentley and sons novel which in a very few weeks after its publication is advertised by the publishers in ordinary to her majesty the queen as being in its fourth edition in threevolume form can at least claim to have hit the taste of a large por tion of the fictionreading public on this ground if upon no other miss corellis last book has a fair title to be considered one of the most notable novels of the past month this success has been attained it is said in spite of rough treatment by the critics whose notices have not been read by the present writer he has however seen a good many paragraphs in various journals describing with much insistence the anxiety displayed by the queen to read this book and the pleasure her majesty has derived from doing so how do they get about those paragraphs which crop up in all sorts of unlikely places giving all sorts of information about the comings and goings the actions and intentions of some writers no theory of spontaneous generation can be entertained for a mnoment it is unlikely that the most successful writer can have a paragraphist attached to his household to act the part played by the herald in a tourney miss corelli herself would appear to feel little gratitude to the press which she accuses in the book under notice of gross unfairness to literary woomen a successful novelist who is one of the female characters in  the soul of lilith protests against  the pitiless storm that assails literary work known to emanate from a womans brain and is only comforted when the hero assures her that  an intellectual woman sets a barrier between herself and the beasts they lnuest detest you in selflefence most of your adverse critics are the poorlypaid hacks of the daily journals who envy you your house your horses your good fortune and your popu larity with the public such opinions show that miss corelli cannot think that she owes any of her own popularity to the puffing of the press she so heartily despises it may be however that if miss corelli is badly treated by the poorlypaid hacks she is admired by injudicious friends who entirely against her own wishes endeavour to  quarter on the enemy so to speak by getting inserted in these very daily journals many paragraphs about the interest the royal famuilyof england take in her last book the advantageous terms she has made with her publishers the handsome revenue she derives from the large sale of her works and all the other varieties of the puff preliminary this seems the most tenable theory and an incident of which we have direct knowledge goes to support it some time since there arrived at the office of the novel review a manuscript entitled 1 a few notes on a celebrated novelist giving various information about miss corelli this was sent back to the name and address given as that of the writer who however seems to have been one of those who  do good by stealth and blush to find it fame for the manuscript was returned through the post as having been unclaimed at the address given its return however relieves the present writer of a difficulty he and he trusts miss corelli will forgive him the crime implied in this admission of his sex on the ground that in this matter he is the victim of circumstances over which he had no control is innocent of any knowledge of the author of  the soul of lilith other than that which can be obtained by readng some of her earlier books now in these days there is an nsatiable desire for personal details about any one who is before the publica desire which appears in its most generous manifestation as heroworship and in its meanest leads people to read the society papers and to visit the chamber of horrors that the lower forms of this desire are wholly detestable is no reason why its higher forms should not be gratified any invasion of the private life of notable persons is undesirable but men or women who seek the suffrages of the public as polticians or writers have themselves and not that public to blame when people want to know all about their political or literary development and when the demand for such informa tion is supplied by the omniscient press the novel revievw is glad to tell the novelreading public all that can fairly be told about the men and women who cater for their amusement and instruction and in the particular case in hand it is possible that our readers may like to know something about miss marie corelli it is perhaps best therefore to give here just as they were sent in by the retiring informant abovementioneda few notes on a celebrated novelist miss marie corelli the author of that extraordinary book a rmance of two worlds and the still more remarkable ardath the story of a dead self of which the spectator justly observed that it had beaten beckfords  vathek is the most unapllroachable of living novelists not from any lack of geniality but simply from her unalterable

enormously on the increase aud from her royalties alone she has a handsome annual income she has a large daily batch of letters from all parts of the world and among her correspondents she counts the queen of italy lord tennyson mr gladstone theodore watts ouida rider haggard and hosts of other wellknown and distinguished people who hold her in the greatest esteem and regard there is not the slightest doubt that she is an extremely pretty and fascinating person and her sympathetic interest in and ready practical aid extended to the struggling aud unfortunate in her own and other artistic lprofessionls is a notable feature of her lovable character she is the very woman who ought to form a  salon after the old french methods for she is the most perfect hostess imaginable never at a loss always realy with some graceful word that puts the awkward at their ease and charms the most indifferent her manner is truly the essence of high courtesy when i first saw her a slight petite figure arrayed in a lovely teagown of vieuxrose velvet a diamond comb catching up the luxuriant mass of her fair hair and noted her joyous childlike smile her radiant eyes her whole aspect so unfagged so riante so altogether anliterary i had much ado to convince myself that she was really the author of the complex and wonderful  ardath t p oconnor calls her  dresden china an epithet which exactly suits her blonde tresses and dazzling complexion and that  dresden china actually wrote that terrible absinthe story  wormwood does seem a curious anomaly she is the darling of her home the idol of her friends and the wags of publishinghouses call her bentleys favourite which it would seem she is personally as well as from a businesspoint of view it is rurnoured that she is to be  sent for to windsor the queen being much fascinated by the originality and poetic beauty of her writings one would be curious to know what her majesty will think of the bewitching little woman herself who has been capable of holding her own in an argument with m1r gladstone andl even causing that  grand old m1an to resign on one occasion a discussion in the house where he was expected for the sake of an afternoon in her company in her own home she receives lords dukes and commoners with equal ease and grace in fact no one is more a favourite with the  upper ten than the pretty marie whose social charm consists in complete unselfish ness and rare tact she can never be persuaded to talk of her self or her works but she will talk of others with enthusiasm and generosity her praise is delicious because so ungrudging add to all this that she is one of the wealthiest amonom the members of the literary profession and can command higher terms for her books than anyone at present to the front that she never works unless it pleases her and even then takes her own time about it and certainly never grinds at anything and we shall have obtained a glimpse as  through a glass darkly at one of the most eminent charming and brilliant women of the time onlooker we have nothing to add to the above account for the accuracy of which we of course cannot vouch and proceed to a consideration of the novel itself in an introduetorv note the author disclaims the tite of novel for her work it is she says  simuply the account of a strange and daring experiment once actually attempted and is offered to those who are interested in the unseen  possibilities of the hereafter merely for what it isa single episode in the life of a inan who voluntarily sacrificed his whole worldly career in a supreme effort to prove the apparently unprovable the hero of this experiment is named elraami a gentleman with a skin dark as a mulattos a black moustache and perfectly white hair but more remarkable still for a pair of eyes which enable him to exercise extraordinary powers he is introduced to us at a performance of  hamlet where he looks full at an american heiress who has been much struck by his appearance  with an instinctive movement she recoiled and her own eyes fell never in all her giddy thoughtless little life had she seen such fiery nightblack brilliant orbs merciful as he is strong el ranii removes his  piercing gaze and informs one sir frederick vaughan a fair dissipatedlooking young fellow who speaks to him that tiie girls name is idina chester that vaughan will be intro uced to her that evening and engaged to her in a fortnight and the prophecy is immediately verified this cheap piece of supernatural dexterity is explained by elratmi on his way home in the first of some dozens of soliloquies in which he indulges as merely a calculation founded on his knowledge of the persons concerned elranmi knows that vaughan is in debt and open to any offer front an heiress that his cousin lord nelthorpe is tired of paying his debts and determined to marry hilm off to miss chester and that  the little chester girl has her heart set on an english title even though it be only that of a baronet the reader is thus led to hope that elrimni is no ordinary thoughtreading quack but is merely gifted with a purely natural but highlycultivated faculty for putting two and two together like the heroes of edgar allan poe intl his imitators these holipes are quickly dashed before he had got further than apsley house on his homeward wav a man snatched his watch and at once  uttered a loud cry and remained inert and motionless elratmi c oidly smnilin takes the watch back and informs the thief that he elrtmi is a  human torpedo and againi soliloquising vaguely on the constitution of things wvends his way to  an unpretentious little house in a small quiet unfashionable square off sloane streetand the reader prepares for the worst amid dim red ligfits an i electric  burners peculiar and costly silks sarkling with iridescent gleams globes geometrical instruments a pile of letters from princes diplomats aud financiers he goes off into another soliloquy in which he declares that knowledge of the earthly future is not enough he imust learn the great secret wanting to call his brother he just concentrates his thoughts  his eyes dilated and grew luridly brilliant as though sparks of fire burnt behind them and in a couple of minutes his beautiful young brother fetraz arrives in a loose white tunic and a hypnotic trance by his occult powers elruni keeps his brother in a cataleptic state at will and when the youth returns to consciousness he plays on an ebonycased pianette the harvesthome songs of the reapers in a bright and faroff star music that  utters divine and dulcet eloquence and then we are introduced to lilith elrlmtiizaranos to give the human torpedo his full style and title some six years b1fore in the course of a journey across the syrian desert had come upon a caravan of arabs in dire distress from want and sickness one of these an elderly widow named zaroba he miraculously cures another an orphan child named lilith he keeps in a state between life and death in the unpretentious house near sloane square with a view to obtaining through her some knowledge about  the great secret he keeps her body alive so to say by injections of a strange sparkling fluid with  a curiously sweet and pungent odour and recalls her soul to it by fixing his eyes on her  with a glance that seemed to shoot forth flame much of the book is taken up with the conversations between the torpedo and his helpless victim to which nothing but quotations can do justice thus to her elrilmi for instancelisten 0 too ecstatic anti believing spirit  we halve

see him passing maid the stars she broke ott suddenly and drew a long breath as of sheer delight elrwimi is a little disappointed at the irrelevance of these 8taccalo messages from the unprovable and worries himself a good deal about it in more soliloquies filling his time with feats of legerdemain a clergyman drops in and elrami reads his thoughts which are not of a very edifying nature by placing his left fingers on the vicars left wrist  directly touching the nerves and arteries running through the heart from the brain  but he fails to impress the vicar who  with a bland smile goes off to lunch at the criterion with a lady  brownhaired and darkeyed of a full luscious beauty mindless but physically attractive who is the wife of the vicars wealthiest neighbour and is naturally rather annoyed because the vicar has kept her waiting at the criterion for him for ten minutes our hero has all the stockintrade of an oxford street necromancer and does some reading in manuscripts with  uncanny figures and allegorical designs he throws up a pinch of sparkling powder like diamond dust waves  a thin steel rod about the size of an ordinary walking cane and produces thereby  a round large brilliant globe of prismatic tints like an enormouslyvinagnified soapbubble this is done to exibit his magical powers to a monk from famagousta in cyprus who retaliates by embodying before the incredulous elrfimi  gods deathless messenger and  the straight pure brilliancy and limpid lustre of those unearthly orbs sent shudders through elratui who becomes very ill indeed after this experience the monk is in fact one too many for our hero he displays the most provoking composure when elrami shows him some information which the soul of lilith has brought from  the golden spaces of the stars concerning  the inhabitants of sirius their laws customs and progress and 1 the world of neptune how it is composed of one thousand distinct nations united under one reigning eumperor known at the present era as ustalvian the tenth the monk disappears mysteriously leaving a written message 1 with liliths love comes liliths freedom unfortunately lilith takes to saluting elrami as  my

to the sleeping lilith by saying  with the air of an inspired sorceress delivering a prophecy i feraz you have manhoodprove it feraz you have missed the one joy of lifelove win it but feraz is too much under the influence of his elder brothers supernatural powers to take her advice and zaroba watches elramis scientific interest giving place to human passion with unholy glee this unpleasant old

becomes livid or to give the sketch of the experiences of ftraz in a london drawingroom and a london studio nor can we comment on the experiments of one kremlin whom elrami doctors with his electroflamma or vital elixir in order that he may continue to investigate the effects of inooushine and starshine on a magic disc but we have given the substance of the story in the authors own words the reader can now appraise for himself the real value of the book and will probably with us regret the waste of miss corellis unmistakable powers on this kind of thing the success of the book can only be accounted for by the fact that many subscribers to the circulating libraries are possessed of the taste and intelligence of the servant girls who form the clientele of fortunetellers and our latterday witches the plentiful peppering of diluted blasphemy does not prevent the soul of lilith from being trash and trash of the dullest description philip herne,englishfiction

the whirlwind fiction by eden phillpotts chapman  hall 6s mr phillpotts is at his best in this his latest novel which made its first appearance in the pages of the fortnightly review his standard is a high one his method is conceived on a large scale it is no other than to bring all the aspects of naturethe changing sky with its range of colours the wind that blows across his devon moors the trees the flowers the animals all the denizens of earthinto league with him in telling one great story of passion or love or disaster his human characters emerge from this great background  first you see the village of lydford nestling quietly in a nook of the wide moorthen the farmhouse ruddyford and the old peat mine the place in which his chief characters live and gradually the chief characters themselves stand out from their fellow villagers and over them something of the eternal greatness of things is thrown something which comes from the greatness of their setting in the carrying out of this conception he brings great skill to bear but the result is not on the level of the intention if it were so mr phillpottss work would take a high place in english literature a place above that of thomas hardy there is something lacking there is an element of disappointment for though his descriptions of natural scenery and events are vivid and at times beautiful though his grip on his characters never relaxes and their doings are always interesting yet the two are never moulded into shape by a view of things the scope of which is sufficiently wide to present one allembracing outlook each remains separate there is no dominant idea which would create the requisite unity in design this defect is noticeable in  the whirlwind though the story is one which never fails to hold the attention and to hold it strongly in isolated detailfor example in the character of hilary woodrow a remarkably subtle study or in the character of sarah jane a magnificent woman or in many descriptions of moorland scenery and of superb happenings in the heavensmr phillpotts has done nothing better but there is a lack of inevitability about the final tragedy and that lack lends to the tragedy an element of sordidness which is belittling great art takes facts which may be in themselves brutal and by its magic touch raises them above themselves by showing that which lies beyond every fact and the beauty which is a part of all suffering this transforming touch is absent from  the whirlwind as it is absent from all mr phillpottss work and its absence prevents his work rising to the high place which the excellence of his actual writing his knowledge of humanity his love of nature would otherwise command  the whirlwind by eden phillpotts  chapman  hall mr phillpotts has come to be recognised as a writer with a sense of the underlying tragedy of life his irony is in a manner sophoclean and he is fond of dealing in primary emotions and with simple psychological problems in this way he undoubtedly gets near the earth  that  good red earth  he loves on dartmoor at one time moving strongly under the influence of mr hardy he had a derivative air  but that has faded and he is now himself and indeed pursues his own course with individuality he has chosen to abide by dartmoor and by dartmoor he stands or falls he brings to it an indeterminable love and a corresponding sympathy the very humours of the moor one feels affect his moods as they affect some of his characters his tales now take the impress of the moor with its gloom its starkness and its dignity this one is the tragedy of a peasant couple daniel brendon and sarah jane friend sarah is the daughter of the moors as brendon is a aeon of them her father is the caretaker of abandoned peatworks in a desolate place and these have eaten their way into his spirit he lives and talks in peat from his solitary cottage arises the tall fair saxon fullbosomed woman with a frankness beyond ordinary and a compelling beauty the giant brendon with his slowmoving wits is attracted by her and so are others but her choice is brendon a godfearing jealous farmlabourer with a strange unwholesome and neurotic master this latter woodrow who is rather unconvincingly represented as something of a misogynist succumbs to the wife of his servant and persistently woos her it is never made clear to us why or how he wins her if it was because she thought to advance her husbands interests then it was not like sarah jane nor is the supposition consistent with her subsequent attitude to woodrow we are forced back upon the suggestion that she was in love with two men at the same time to which we demurin the womans case at any rate however it is obvious by this time that mr phillpotts is marching fast on tragedy and owing to the meanness of an old admirer sarahs tragedy deveiopes quickly the slow fires of the passive brendon awake and break into flame in the end we leave him in the salvation army uniform though the date of the story is fifty years back it mill be seen that while mr phillpotts runs the risk as often of falling into melodrama he keeps himself out of that pit by the artistry of his handling and the dignity of his characterization in playing with heroic issues he never descends to bathos and the conclusion satisfies poetic justice if it wrings the tender heart,englishfiction
  uncle ralph  a tale by the author of  doro thy parker  sonuncle ralphis a readable little story some of the characters are well drawn especially that of susan who commits cruel injustice by default the wrong that can be comprised in the mere abstinence from doing right is shown with some subtlety nevertheless the moral of the tory will hardly commend itself to soberminded elders two young creatures engaging themselves to be married without the least prospect of adequate ways and means would in real life meet with small countenance from prudent relatives miriam though justified perhaps in the eyes of the reader would certainly have a verdict against her in a family council held in any  cedar parlourinthe ltnited kingdom she was an  exceptional case but would make a dangerous precedent the one good point in the story is the tracing out of the poisonous influence of a wrong motive upon actions which in themselves are lawful and right uncle ralph himself is a very foolish elderly gentleman who believes everything he is told and who does everything he is bid by anybody which is the cause of all the woe ami confusion in the story,englishfiction

voh smith aad bider gores lively hand is yet far from having lost its cunning it is much the best novel we have had from her of late years but the interest which holds its scenes together is somewhat of the flimsiest and there is never that welldefined purpose and but seldom the masterly detection of worldly motive which in mrs gores earlier works gave so much solidity as well as point to her sketches of society these latter however are still characteristic as of old though we have to put up with  greatestliappinessofthe gveatestnumber people and such like commonplaces instead of our old favourites the  killyourownmuttonsoil of people the drift of the book as far as we can see is to show the moralising or demoralising effects of english society and fashionable life according to the temper and disposition over which they exercise an influence but the contrast of the sisters is a little overdone the flavour is too high in the one case and in the other perhaps somewhat too low we find the happiest parts of the novel away from both old  squire pro  is a capital sketch and the progress of his clever son to eminence through all the obstructions that beset the aspiring commoner in england has more of mrs gore 8 better spirit than anything else in the book the mere writing is always pointed and clever and though few of the scenes have not been similarly dwelled upon in former novels we may not call the book tedious indeed it is a readable and interesting novel the opening chapters are particularly good and various the picture of sir george downham between the family of his first wife who despise him and his choice of a second wife whom he shall himself be entitled to despise is an excellent piege of satire and the death of the wife is a beautiful and affecting piece of writing there is also plenty of mirth to stand hi place of a better story in the amusing hits at the stokesleigbs the hartingharas lumleys and tom noddys in the quiet laughter at female pretenders from sanctimonious duchesses to mrs euphrasia primwells and in whimsical descriptions of high life from  the little crowing thing in the nursery entitled to a coronet on its papboat to the condescending great lady in the country dance  trying to look joyous aud great british while undergoing the familiarities of hands across in short there is plenty to amuse the novel reader in mrs gores diamond and pearl though less than used formerly to be found in her works to satisfy readers more difficult to amuse  the diamond and the pearl by mrs gore 3 vols colburn for a person who would be described by the majority as principally skilled in sarcastic sallies and those expositions of savoirvivre which imply keeping pace with our breathless times mrs gore possesses a store of fancy and imagination richer than ordinary an occupation more genial than the incessant keeping record of mayfair frivolities might have given her an honourable name among poetesses this we think may be gathered from her perpetual resort to trope and symbolfrom the garniture with which she can clothe some flimsy bit of worldly wisdomfrom her perpetual and we apprehend almost involuntary recurrence to the phraseology of scripture had this novel owned any other parentage its title might have led us to expect a narration of the notable murders done by a necklace or the eavesdroppings of an earring but we knew that mrs gore was about to treat us to a brilliant woman contrasted with one of tenderlydelicate nature and thus accordingly it comes to pass yet our authoress does not fulfil the promise of her title as she might have done her diamond is neither pitt nor pujotno veritable  mountain of light but a patchedup thing put together by some chemical jeweller with his blowpipe ns was the sevigne proffered by miss edgeworths lady hcarcroft to lady davenant some we suspect will object to grant it as much praise as this  or to allow that there is one scrap of  pure carbon in its composition calling the glittering toy at once a bad name  a counterfeita piece of palaisroyal paste we know of old that mrs gore shines in the delineation of hard worldly women why then could not she vary her figure for once making her helen as brilliant ns she pleased in wit beauty and ambitionperilled by this very brilliancybut still genuine andnotasnow thepoorhack of fashion all efforts and

place behold a mayfair lioness far better does blanche the pearl keep the promise of her name as sister daughter wife she is  a veritable margaret foiling the false brilliant with her purity and exquisite delicacy of colour yet even here mrs gore has not been able to rise superior to old conventions if  to be pearl is best what need was there of giving to the innocence beauty and holy wisdom of her heroine the sanction of fashion i well is mrs gore aware not only that a real mrs john watts could never have become the rage with the suddenness here described but what is more that she would not society is a strange complex thing and the step from absolute retirement to the observation of all observers may be taken by a una without peril but cannot without pain  still less per saltnm we had hoped after mrs gores rest from production that she would have given us something more natural and less novell than this tale of surprises conversions reformations vide sir george downham and judgments as set j forth in the fate of the llartingham title she j is always smart and amusingbut will she never more be probable  after what has been said no person of any moderation will expect a more precise account of how the diamond sparkled and through what amount of vicissitudes the pearl kept its purity some of the sketches of character in this novel are lively the picture of the household of the peerbishop is as graphic in ita grimness and its primness as most that we have looked upon other hits seem almost personal from the unnecessary and ineffective sharpness with which they are launched as usual mrs gore ranges herself on the side of the movement yet as too frequently happens it would seem as if she could not satisfactorily get to an endloflur task without

a county family a novel by the author of  lost 51 va1 tinalev brothers sir massingberd 3 vols tinsley brothers this is one of a large class of novels which it is very difficult to describe yet there are few more interesting studies in literature than the attempt to discover the peculiar difference that exists between the true and genuine novel which contains actual portraits of living and veritable people and the counterfeit novel which has only the raw materials of fictionthe simulacra of life these latter novels seem to us but a heap of dry bones over which the author has breathed in vain they will not stir in spite of his best endeavours the characters are mere puppets which imitate the movements of men and women and yet show clearly to the spectator the strings by which they are moved nevertheless it is possible to take some interest in watching the different combinations which the master of the puppets produces there is often in these novels the outline of a stirring and dramatic story which the inexperienced novelreader will regard with interest the experienced novelreader on the other hand is content to watch the evolutions of the story with curiosity he says to himself  what is to be the next combination of these puppets  surely it is time for the villain to make his appearance a murder at least is due in the next chapter will the hardhearted father be made to relent or will he be killed off   we repeat the story of some of these novels is frequently highly ingenious the kaleidoscopic changes of position are marvellous considering the monotonous sameness of the materials used and as we wish to say as much as possible in favour of the industrious and painstaking author of  a county family we will preface some brief account of the novel by remarking that the story is likely to be very interesting to those whose individual power of imagination may lead them to fancy that they are regarding real men and women in  a county family we find a good many old friends there is the obdurate father the lover who is forbidden the house the faithful heroine the mercenary suitor the villain who has murdered his wife and who torments everybody until the bursting of a reservoir swallows him up tet before the author settles down to the level jogtrot of storytelling we catch a glimpse of one figure which promises much anthony blackburn when we are first introduced to him looma large and distinct out of the mist of vague and commonplace detail which smothers the story we cannot help suspecting that the author of  a county family had some definite original in his mind when he sketched this character so true and lifelike is the old man until he gets enveloped in the conventional meshes of the tale and disappears from sight this anthony blackburn is an old man who in his youth married a country wench and was thereupon disinherited by his father and sent forth into the world to earn his own living when we meet him he ia a quarryman earning his daily bread on the side of one of the welsh mountains he is possessed by the one idea that he will yet become the owner of the family estates hia younger brothers who have according to the fathers will successively taken possession of the property have one by one been removed by death they and their offspring until there stands between him and the estates only one young man at the opening of the story old anthony blackburn haa just had his dinner brought bim by his granddaughter ellen in presence of a visitor assasd stsahope family anthony blaekbura waa iadssssdhwlry of sis wtiss

silver bottom of hit pocketflask in place of the broken tumbler  if you will permit me to fill it with sherry instead of water said he politely41 have more here than i require u nay sir i do not drink

he with sudden interest yes and my addressherbert stanhope of curlew hall at your service oh indeed returned the old man with an affectation of unconcern while his face bronzed with sun and wind turned suddenly quite pale good morning sir and thank you it it time for me to begin work again with that he took up hit accustomed weapon but the visitor who at this hint had retired to tome distancenoticed that he did not make a stroke with it for several minutes but stood leaning on the long handle at if in thought stanhope looked round for the girl but she had disappeared and then for the overlooker but he had also slipped away so shrugging his shoulders he lighted a cigar and betook himself down the unprotected incline notwithstanding that a bugle had just blown to give warning to all to seek shelter the granddaughter ellen whose father is dead is betrothed to a young engineer named john denton who ia a sort of overseer at the quarry in which anthony blackburn works she has an uncle the eldest son of old anthony who is the family bugbear this william blackburn is quite a typical villain he has just completed a term of imprisonment when we find him idling in one of the channel islands he has married a poor girl whom he brutally illuses in fact his conduct towards women throughout the whole book is peculiar it must have cost him an uncommon deal of trouble to be so officiously and pertinaciously offensive we are led to believe that villainy is very hard work and that if it waa william blackburns business to furnish forth the  dreadful example  to everybody around him there was never poor mortal so dreadfully overwrought the author gives him neither sleep nor rest he must be continually sulking at some one or cursing at some other or threatening a third indeed the author of  a county family  has on previous occasions shown an amount of cruelty towards his villains which is much to be regretted there never was such a slavedriver if the characters in a novel had any will of their own we feel assured that this writers villains would  strike and refuse to have all the business of the story thrown upon their shoulders mr tates is another writer who used to overwork bis villains but of late he has become tenderhearted and much lem of a taskmaster before however saying anything of what mr william blackburn is made to do in  a county family let us take a last look at his father before he becomes nebulous old anthony blackburn does inherit his own estates and returns thither aa he drives up to the door of the house with his wife and granddaughter beside him a number of the tenantry and neighbours are collected he stops the carriage and addresses them and there is something very fine and natural about these unpremeditated and earnest words neighbours and friends said he in a hoarse voice  i thank you for your welcome tonne ought to know me well though you do not but that it not my fault nor yours i thought to stand here thanking your fathers for drinking my good health as their young squire when i should have come of age just fifty years ago that was when mr moffat yonder was as young as any man here and long before

new novels a magdalens husband by vincent brown duckworth  co tue motto chosen by the author for this remarkable study of village life in england is  they know not at what they stumble and it is finely appropriate some readers will remember this authors ordeal by compassion and such will look for serious artistry and conscientious psychological analysis in the present volume they will not be disappointed the book is full of such patient and minute analysis it has real spiritual significance the author does not tell us where the village is in which his lovingly delineated characters move and have their being and the time may be the present but though the human local colouring if one may use the phrase is admirably and distinctively worked in time and place are of no importance in such a story the emotions dealt with were as active the grave complications were as real and as ever present under the first edward of england as they are under edward vii  a magdalens husband has points in common with tess of the durbervilles the authors mental outlook reminds one somewhat of mr hardys but it is less powerful less farseeing enough has been said to indicate that his book does not at all belong to the common order of novels many pages tempt the reviewer to quotation but this is not a volume of smart dialogue there is not an epigram in it and that being so it does not lend itself to brief representative quotation the story is of a woman seduced led and driven into an immoral life and subsequently brought to tread the thorny road of selfredemption reformed she marries a coarse passionate man of her own village chiefly one supposes to win a home and she is loved ardently seriously deeply by another man of the village a man cast in a far finer mould than her husband with all her real goodness and sweetness of character this magdalen is a singularly tactless person a deep honest nature hopelessly lacking in adaptability therein lies her tragedy as a wife her husband has his good points  her hopeless want of tact renders them ineffective then comes murder and the tragedy of the tale deepens the murderers atonement is a strong piece of work and the whole is a fine study as a drama it would have been more effective if the woman had been made more lovable if she were more really and less consciously a martyr the book might have taken rank with the best but as it is it is notable there is something curiously feminine by the way in the authors handling of men  ilovel vtotes a magdalens husband by vincent brown 6s duckworth and co the spring season has given us one heartening surprie at least in the novel which messrs duckworth publish under the title a magdalens husband feihlais this title is not the best that could have been chosen but the story itself is beyond doubt exceptional powerful moving it is a detailed drama of life in an english village of fine natures and debased at the same time it is a transcript of life in the large a widelyobserved tragedy of primal passions and spiritual force revealed with the slow biting skill of the man who sees and feels the great beyond the little and tells of it with that deep emotion which makes no loud noise but stirs the source of tears something of the terse force of thomas hardy is here in this book of strength and promise,englishfiction

the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as

miss balmaines past by b m croker 66 cbatto this would be a passably good story if we could believe it but it keeps hitting tip against reality and credibility all the time and gets much bruised and battered miss balmaines  past  was a foolish not a bad one she had made a secret marriage when very young and her husband left for foreign parts immediately to make his fortune and hers he was wrecked on a desert island where his beard grew and his skin was tanned so that when he was delivered some few years after and returned to england to claim a title his young wife did not recognise him meanwhile the child born to them was spirited away by the young wifes wicked mother and was growing up neglected when his father found him quite by accident feeling an affinity he adopted him the best possible opportunities were given to miss balmaine to recognise the identity of her lost husband and lord airdrie but for the purposes of miss crokers story she persisted in her stupidity and played the part of the haughty rejecter of all offers for hdr hand because of an embittered past everything in the story fits in cleverly to an improbable situation and as situation is everything and characters and workmanship in this novel to much below the usual level of miss crokers powers hardly count at all when the plot fails to satisfy there is little to fall back upon for interest or amusement  miss balmaines past by b m croker chatto  windus though not among the best of mrs crokers now numerous novels miss balmaines past is decidedly readable and though there are certain difficulties lu the plot a decidedly enjoyable story it is practically a story of today with only occasional references to the angloindian subjects with which readers of mrs crokers stories are familiar the writer sets herself the task of separating a husband and wife in circumstances which make it natural that the lady should fail to recognise the man and that the man should refrain from revealing his identity to his wife and we fear the effort is too great for mrs crokers constructive abilities we will not divulge the details of the plot which is sufficiently interesting to be spoilt by recital but it is necessary to point out that the writer seeks to support her theory by saying of the hero  his antecedents were wrapped in mystery but when a man is rich titled and unmarried people are not too searching in their inquiries these elements would we should have thought rather serve to stimulate the inquiries in question nevertheless the story is wholesome and interesting  and it deserves recognition as a work of honest literary effort and unquestionable attraction on one page we notice an accident to the type which should have been corrected and in another place the epithet  moonflooded as applied to a landscape would have been better omitted,englishfiction

the cost of a secret the cost of a secret is a novel written evidently by an author of refinemnent and imagination and its faults are precisely those which are oftenest found united with considerable imaginative power novels may be divided like all other productions of artistic minds into two classes and belong either to the ideal or to the realistic school the minute delineation of life and manners that we get so frequently in novels of the day is more fatiguing and less pleasant than the ideal and even shadowy conceptions given to us by more dreamy and poetical writers we live in a dust and a noisy age and to educated readers whose path through fife lies in a crowd and in a throng it is a relief to escape into a volume  the cost of a secret b the author of  4aga tror ia thmv ol

great difficulty withl which a writer has to contend who belongs to tile more fanciful land romantic school is this that it is not easy to depict character oln a ilaroe and a romantic scale when tile figures can after all be figures of iiien alnd women only the classical artist raises them above the earth by laying the scene of ac tion eithler inl heaven or at least ill that mysterious mythical ge of heroes and demigods the personages of which were surrounded with an indistinct and romantic grandeur it was something more thnm human sorrow which spoke to the greek in the person of an antigone or anl edipus nor was there any dangner of the plot of the story being of necessity either vulgrar on the one hand or improbable and extravagant upon the other a modern author has no such resources as were vouchsafed by the peculiar circulmstances of the age to the classical poet or mythologist he is anxious to tfl from all imitation of common life and in shunning scylla he falls into charybdis he paints men and women for he call paint nothing else  and in endeavouring to remove them fromn the everydav level of comnmon things he often miakcs his plut unnatural improbable and absurdc the effect is that he challengcs and provokes the very comparison with conmmon life that he wishes to avoid his heroes move about as heroes never nion ed before ill this world his heroines place tlieiielves in positions which have no parallel oln eartlh his groups are admirable balt the lights and shadows are overdone and the backg round is a background constructed upon untenable assumptions which seem to do violence to our experience and to conltradict all that we have ever heard or seen wise indeed is the rare and happy novelist who in such a dilemma refrains from mixing in these impossible proportions the idleal and the real and confines himself to making the interest of his piece turn entirely upon the internal play of the feelings or at least upon the siniple and picturesque grouping of the figures rthe more common error is that of the author whose personages and characters charm us by their grace and their truth so loing as they stand still but when they move and act act in violation of the ordinary laws of probability and social experience it is seldom that the reader of fiction comes upon a threevolume novel in which there is as much to please and as little to offend as is to be found in  the cost of a secret the conceptions of character ill it are graceful and refined  nor are the heroes and heroines built in aniy except a truthful mould with the exception of the deus 0 mtackind of the tale a certain ai corsand whose virtues perhaps verge upon the superhuiiian the other male and female characters possess the rare advantage of being at one and the same time both naturally and elegrantly drawn the literary part of the book is done beyond all question well  and on arriving at the close we can feel that in point of taste there has not been a blemish through the whole like agnes trenmorne a novel by the same hand the cost of a secret is framed oln a classical model and by classical fingers both tales belong to the gallery of art in which stand the creations of some of the best modern writers of the classical school but  the cost of a secret has a fault which will not be found in the exjuisite productions of such a novelist as the author of  tranlsformation that the plot should be unreal is not in itself an insuperable objection but the plot which in reality is improbable and unreal is meant beyond all doubt for a plot of real life and as such it provokes a criticism and an investigation which it is unable successfully to bear the merit of the tale would have been greater but for this had the author been contented with elaborating quietly the different admirable characters that had been put upon the scene without introducing them to an impossible complication of circumstances  the cost of a secret might have lost something but it would have gained even more the author was afraid of being dull and determined apparently to create an interest fromn the story itself independently of the characters of the story nor can it be said that the object has been altogether unattained the secret is somewhat transparent and a curious inquirer might discover the key sooner perhaps than the author imagines but the thread of narrative is on the whole well sustained andon the assumption that the narrative was possible at allwould be calculated to interest and pklease unfortunately this assumption is untenable the plan is too fanciful to be hunman there have been nien and women like the men and women we meet in  the cost of a secret and they have been clhriuinir men and women but inever were nmen and women placed in so singular and unlikely a position as that in which the characters o f  trhe cost of a secret  have been placed by its refined nd ind genious author it is owing doubtless to thle imaginative tendlency of the author that all the heroes and heroines of the story are irawn ill some picturesque light or other and never stand except in ain artistic attitiide the authtlor seems to look on them not merely as hmunian beingrs but as staituies or works of airt she plaees them andtd walks roundi thelii g iving themii a totuch helre and there or adding in ani ingelliolus way to thle etfect when she wishes

the pillars of the house the pillars of the house or under ttode under rode by charlotte m yonge author of thc heir of redclyffe c in four volumes macmillan we fancy that miss yonges publishers exercised a wise discretion in issuing  the pillars of the house  in instalments of a volume at a time the heart of the boldest and most eager novelreader might have quailed before the achievement of mastering the four volumes at once 1220 pages each containing we should say at least half as much again as a page of an ordinary novel the book is in fact hardly so much a novel as an imaginary family history an account during a period of eighteen years of the fortunes of the thirteen sons and daughters of the rev edward underwood and mary his wife the youngest of whom a twin boy and girl are born on the very day of their fathers death for purposes of reference we are favoured with a copy of the first page of the underwood family bible setting forth the christian names in full and the dates of birth of the thirteen heroes and heroines as well as with a rough outline map of the vale leston estate and a ground plan of the house mr underwood had married his distant cousin the niece and adopted daughter of the rector of vale leston with the assurance of ultimately succeeding to the living and meantime acting as curate it was a family living always held conjointly with a tolerably good estate enough to qualify the owner for what miss young considers the dangerous position of squarson but the uncle dying suddenly and with a flaw in his will an undesirable nephew and heiratlaw whom he had desired to exclude stepped in and disliking mr underwoods high church opinions made his own son take orders for the sake of the living edward underwood took a curacy at bexley and as his stipend did not increase and his family did overwork and worry have so told on a not naturally strong constitution that he dies before we have got through the first 100 pages of the book and his wife soon follows him then felix the eldest son a boy of sixteen for the sake of his family renounces all thought of oxford and the church and becomes assistant to mr froggat the bexley bookseller who combines with his business the proprietorship of the pursuivant a local journal and he and wilmet the eldest girl resolve to be pillars of the house and keeps home together for the younger ones it is the history and result of their endeavour that forms the theme of the story we shall not attempt any summary of the book which indeed would be impossible within anything like reasonable limits it will be sufficient to say a few words as to its general character it is prolix  it is sometimes tedious  it is so overcrowded with characters that we get into a maze as to whos who  we are often bored with its nursery and schoolroom moralities and long to escape into a higher and freer atmosphere and yet somehow we are interested in it and carried on to the end as we often fail to be by many books showing far higher mental gifts in their authors miss young is one of those who receive the blessing promised to whosoever is faithful over a few things her range is of the narrowest but within it she shows herself thoroughly the artist nearly all her characters herecertainly all the thirteen underwoods have a distinct life and individuality of their own though author hardly tells us a word about them but shows them to us as they are and makes us watch them through a growth and development which poor and stunted as it must be deemed by all whose minds are not cramped by the shackles of her prim anglicanism we yet feel is true and consistent naturally she succeeds better with her women than her menor rather wo should say with her girls than her boys for whatever be the time of life  assigned to them her leading dramatis jvrsona always bear distinctly the stamp of nonage the austerity and excessive prudence and carefulness developed in wilmet through her youthful responsibilities when she has to think hard how to make the most of every halfpenny in the shilling a devotion to the commonplace strangely at variance with her faultlessly beautiful faceis excellently and most amusingly sketched indeed the beautiful face i9 to the practical wilmet  w w as her brothers cali her from her two names wilmet ursula rather an annoying superfluity im sure she says i should be glad enough not to be pretty but it is a trial and one must do the best one can even greater skill is shown in the picture of the lame girl geraldine or cherry who is to us the most interesting of the group and with her genius her passion for art and beauty and her bright wit reminds usa long way off it is truebut still does remind us of the charming eugenie de la ferronnaye though miss young is quite without any deep humour she has a great appreciation of liveliness and wellbred fun andwe have laughed heartily over many of her scenes her pathetic passages too have often great tenderness and beauty though she is here on dangerous ground for she has a hankering after melancholy details and mere sentimentalism which continually threatens to lead her astray wre have wished sometimes that miss young could at a sufficiently early age have been brought under the influence of wider and freer modes of thinking and viewing things than that prevalent in the refined and scholarly but intensely narrow clerical circles whose spirit she reproduces so faithfully she might so have been led to apply her powers of realistic painting which in a certain way are really great to the production of something higher and worthier than pictures of the rather small lives of some halffledged boys and girls more or less good or  naughty yet probably for her readers at any rate it is better as it is she would have been puzzled and overwhelmed if told to see life with her own eyes and finds ecclesiastical leadingstrings a support more than a restraint we doubt if she would have ever done really better work than she does now in the field that has become natural to her a field hedged in by the proprieties and respectabilities with the creeds and the church catechism accepted on all hands as the dernier mot of speculation and morality thence she can look out on the waste lands of schism that lie beyond and on those gloomier regions in the far distance the  antres vast and deserts idle the home of

  between the acts by henry w nevinson ivtuuvu murray the drama of life says mr nevinson is divided into acts and only in the intervals when the actdrop falls do we become conscious of the real significance of what has passed that is certainly true of most men and applying it he remarks that in the majority of autobiographies we are most interested when the writer forgets his own prominence and introduces figures which have  moved upon the distant stage and but for his notice would have been forgotten we are to understand apparently that these sketches represent such retrospect casual episodes and situations which i have observed or imagined  in these entractes of life that  imagined has we think much virtue it is difficult to conceive that most of these sketches are actual experiences unless mr nevinson has been given unusually romantic opportunities in fact apart from the two opening essays for such they may be called these sketches based on observed fact or not take the shape of short tales nowise to be distinguished from the short story in general whatever their origin they are well written and that is all which matters the first two essays are personal reminiscences of childish or boyish scenes the second is a record of schooldays very well done but we prefer the first  a london merchant it is merely a sketch of a grandfathers family prayers and the various members of the household assembled for that rather gloomy function but it is done with an excellent quietness and geniality of humour from the evangelical and tory grandfather tb the housekeeper on whose head fluttered the supersensual essence of a cap they are all types and types of that older world well worth preservation the evangelical grandfather is a delightful personage dexterously remembered for sunday reading he chiefly commends the children to  the family sepulchre he once alarmed the household by reciting a poem of moores but his customary attitude towards such sinful frivolities was stern the family aunts in their youthful years he led to hear joanna baillie recite one of her  plays of the passions yon know or you do not know those  plays of the passions they are perfectly academic passions but midway he arose  my dears this is no fit place for you he pronounced and led the four daughters out in file leaving the licentious poetess to finish her drama as best she might after such a testimony to its seductive power poor academic joanna yet despite his evangelicalism he was a rigid tory because un ancestor was reputed to have rendered some vague service to king charles the martyr you know that old man though you probably never have met him but the remainder of the contents as we have said are veritably short stories they are all psychological studies phases of character not of special originality not what we should call brilliant they are yet skilfully handled with a mastery over the mechanism of the short story and with much delicacy in the analysis of temperament one for instance  a dons day is the study of a university don with an undecided and undecidable vocation for the church it is we think a lit le overemphasized the valetudinarian and incessant diagnosis of his own spiritual state though recognisably possible and in the picture awakens the readers impatience to a degree we scarce think intended the man is an insufferable and weakminded prig who wants shaking that may be the authors verdict  since he ends by making him set off as a foreign missionary but one is not hopeful of his missionary future one doubts whether he has the pluck or unselfishness for the zeal to be lasting his vacillation and selfabsorption are overdrawn in fact another sketch shows a journalist unselfishly spending himself for a girl who accepts his devotion blindly and is in love with a poet we do not recognise that poet he is too brilliant in talk too romantic altogether the poet of commerce is not that way and we would back the journalist against him with the young lady but it is sympathetically done  en revanche a further story presents a poet as the luckless lover outrivalled by a professor who deserts the lady of their common affection they meet her afterwards as a worn and toomarried woman with a sick husband and the other appurtenances of the situation but the thing is worked out with a tenderness which effaces its conventional elements in truth these are very clever sketches possessing both emotional and humorous power at once delicate and restrained they stand well above the usual level even of the wellwritten short story  between the acts by henry wv nezinson gs net murray in this exceedingly interesting miscellany nmr nevinson has embodied much of personal observation and experience the two opening essays give very vivid and pleasant glimpses of the authors earlier years both at home and at school and are written with a charm and a quiet humour that tempt one back to read them through again the stories are wonder fully varied  in twentyfocr hours an episode of the terrible stampede of the greeks in their war against turkey is charged with a tense but reticent pathos and the fearsome panicstricken flight itself is described with such an imaginative realism that it haunts the reader almost as if it were an actual memory of his own other stories are of the boer war of various phases of life abroad of journalistic life at home and one  the last rag is of lower london and will rank with mr nevinsons masterly and never sufficiently recognised neighbours of ours the lyrics interspersed among the stories are touched with a grace and melody of poetic fancy and emotion of the ballads perhaps a ballad of gods mercy is the most powerful and the most finely imaginative this is an arresting and a memorable book written with the sureness of touch the knowledge of life and broad humanity that marks all mr nevinsons best work,englishfiction
tallangetta the squatters home a story ofj australian life bv william howitt 2 vols longman  co the preface to these volumes is a singular example of absurdity mr howitt intensely satisfied with his own performance volunteers for the benefit of the reader a statement in behalf of a class of persons calling themselves or called by their dupes spiritualists he introduces a spiritualist or hat and tableturner into this story of australian life and endeavours to justify a stageeffect so monstrous by flinging a modest sneer at prof faraday and bursting into a digression on communications with departed friends the rosicrucian mysteries of friar bacons brazen head and a certain american poet who has written things  among the finest since shelley and byron we will not quote the passage that follows to use a phrase of mr howitts it is  smoke from a plea for the irrational he advances by no natural process to a panegyric upon himself this is honest enough we are gratified to learn that  a distinguished officer in victoria said  mr howitts volumes are not like the colonythey are the colony itself but it is more than amusing to find a long and somewhat ridiculous letter from a gentleman who has never seen australia transcribed as a still more remarkable testimony to the impressions of verisimilitude with every willingness to credit mr howitt as an accurate reporter upon life and realities in the land of gold we cannot accept as  remarkable testimony the opinion of a novelist who had merely  read some thirty books about that country and found mr howitts  infinitely the best quitting the illconsidered and undignified preface we find in the novel a rather commonplace story garnished with pictures at once vivid and simple of colonial life especially among the squatters we have in fact a nearer view of character and manners among the pastures and diggings than was afforded in the two years in victoria mr howitt opens his tale well and in a way to excite an immediate interest the curtain rises upon an old english family wrongfully deprived of its possessions journeying into the interior of australia to live at a station  until things take a new turn the new turn is taken in due course and the curtain descends upon the same family restored to england and to its rightful inheritance the interval is filled with scenes in cities and by flood and field in the colonyrevolving however round tallangetta where the delicate squatters create a temporary home mr howitt paints a gallery of special portraits and does his best to illustrate the kind of life led under such circumstances in australia aa well as the human idiosyncrasies to be encountered  as dr spenser grayson the poetdr woolstan the spiritualistand mr flavel the seer not to repel the reader by dwelling upon these grotesque imaginings we will extract a passage from a trial scene in which mr howitts manner and the nature of his story are exemplified a young man charged with murder is at the bar an eccentric witness in his favour randall has been badgered by the counsel for the prosecution   sir said randall  i have answered you many questions that have nothing whatever to do with the cause at issue and now your position shall not protect you i throw myself on the justice of the court on the impartial spirit of my countrys laws i insist that you answer me one question you have dared to probe my life and endeavoured to blast my reputation before the worldanswer me thiswhat did your father say when at your vehement and repeated solicitation he granted you a last secret interview beneath the banshee oak in dunallen park the haughty lawyer stood arrested at that question as by a supernatural blow which turned him to a statue he appeared petrified by astonishment my father the banshee oak he stammered yes your father the banshee oak said randall outwardly calm yet plainly and justly incensed your father the venerable loni dunallen do you not see him said the homelylooking squatter rising as if inspired and pointing to a particular part of the court all eyes uicludmg those of the terrorstricken lawyer mechanically following his finger do you not see him now leaning on his cane shaken by grief as by a palsy and his bare white head gleaming in the moonlight as he says solemnly you have banished your brother you have killed your mother by a broken heart you have disgraced your family you have deceived and left utterly desolate your father who now stands here alone before god in his age may you repent repent for rather would i see you lying dead on that bod than that the people of the dunallen estates should ever fall into your power in your present unchristian unregenerate temper there was a sensation throughout the court as if a thunderbolt had fallen on it a deathlike silence prevailed and the proud counsel who so lately had born down all before him by his talent and audacity suddeidy dropped on his seat with his head on the table and was even sliding to the floor when some of the other counsel caught him and had him born from the court the sensation throughout the crowd was inconceivable no words could describe it people lawyers all present sprung to their feet all sense of order was lost there was one loud buzz of voices expressing amazement at this most singular occurrence and numbers hastening out to gain further intelligence of the stricken down man at length the officers of the court restored some degree of attention the judge wonderfidly affected rose and summed up compelled several times to pause for composure and when he dismissed the jury to consider their verdict they almost instantly by their foreman pronounced clear and loud the words not guilty this is a melodrama but it is effectively worked up and is a specimen of mr howitts narrative style in description he is more felicitous take this sketch of the diggings twenty thousand people at least were all scuffling together like ants in an ants nest or tadpoles in a pool the whole valley through which ran the creek or brook for several miles was in the act of being turned upside down close as the crowd could press upon each other so as to leave the prescribed number of feet for each party they were digging delving throwing up earth carrying away bags of it supposed to contain the gold to the creek and there delivering it to other crowds who at a long fine of cradles were in as great a bustle throwing in the earth rocking it to and fro under deluges of water from tin dippers there was an incessant noise of rattling cradles and shouting voices strange figures all yellow with clay and disguised in bushy beards and veils to keep off the flies seemed too desperately busy to have time to breathe it was all one agitated scene of elbowing swearing hacking hewing and shovelling not a tree was left standing over the whole great space and the sim flamed down on unsheltered heaps and holes of gravel with a burning sweltering force

novel notes donna tlresa by frances mary peard 6s macmillan there is excellent work in miss peards new book work that is vigorous crisp and enjoyable her central character donna teresa is well conceived well carried out and interesting withal moreover we like her though we regard htr forcing on ot sylvias marriage with wilbraham in a much more serious light than does miss peard we will not say it was an ingenious way of getting a fool of a sister off her hands but every time she covered or slurred over sylvias foolishness before her lover she juggled with her conscience in a parlous fashion perhaps sylvias stupidity is exaggerated she appears just on the border line of idiocy and if that were so even to allow wilbraham without remonstrance to propose to her was a crime wilbraham was a stiff prig but a prig with a rather important future would such an imbecile have been capable of the insight and the heroism of the end  some may doubt by intensifying the idiocy of the amiable sylvia miss peard has shaken several portions of her story yet we do not take back our praise for the vigorous sketches of life the clearcut portraits and the general ability of  donna teresa the roman background is effective and our only regret with regard to any of the minor characters is that we see so little of the irreconcilable cesare  donna teresa by frances mary peard donna teresa is the young english widow of an italian nobleman we are here concerned with her later loving and with that of her sister sylvia the story is a tragedy and is laid in rome which in mrs peard s experienced hands yields attractive backgrounds macmillan 6s  bonna teresa new novels by f m peard mac millan  co miss peard is one of the few modern authors who can without being dull write for the young girl and for those readers who shrink from too violent an appeal to the imagination she unfailingly reaches a certain degree of excellence in her worklimited decidedly but none the less excellenceand her new novel is no exception to this rule donna teresa is a natural impulsive young person full of generous if mistaken aspirations after the good of others and bound in consequence to burn her own and everybody elses fingers from purely altruistic motives she exerts herself and temporarily succeeds in converting her excessively uninteresting but pretty sister into the heroine of a romance with a man who thrown perpetually in their joint society must inevitably end in subjugation to her own brilliant personality the situation is worked out with considerable skill all the characters are good but perhaps the author has never done a better piece of work than the study of sylvia brodrick a petty complacent yet withal pathetic nonentity the denoament is not so good it requires a stronger hand than miss peards to deal with the sensational incident that she introduces and the end is distinctly unsatisfactory none the less the story is most wholesome and pleasant reading and full of good common sense while the boman and later the sicilian setting provides a very picturesque element,englishfiction

jewels in brass by jittie horlick duckworth and co 6s miss jittie horlick has accomplished two things in which many more experienced novelists fail in  jewels in brass  there is an arresting beginning and a graceful close the mythical continent of atlantis forms the scene of the opening chapters two characters figure here which are afterwards reincarnated in ordinary modern forms they consist of a charming young woman and a gentleman with peculiar eyes destined in his previous state to meet and be attracted by this same young woman the scene of their first meeting and the barriers to their union must be left to the reader to discover throughout the story there are several flashes of very good insight into the workings of the womans mind although there cannot be said to be any considerable development of it after her first great step the book consists more of a series of incidents and ordinary happenings rather than any particular delineation of character the whole forms very agreeable reading however and those who pursue the story to its end can be promised an hour or twos keen enjoyment,englishfiction
  the american prisoner bv eden phillnnffa methuen  co this book is laid in mr phillpottss familiar huntinggrounds but instead of being a study of dartmoor rustic life and character it is an adventurous romance centring round the great war prison near tor royal in the earliest days of last century there are rustic characters in it to be sure and some very good descriptions of dartmoor scenery but it is frankly an adventure story and not a novel of character rustic or otherwise it holds too for us the suggestion of an author whose true bent is the study of character and scenery and natural conditions as they affect character striving after a new effect a new vehicle of expression from a sense of expediency and forgetting his object as often as he becomes truly interested in his work this is not a pleasing or satisfying suggestion for one likes to feel that an author is wholehearted in his work that sense we do not have in reading the american prisoner and consequently we think that mr phillpotts has come very near to falling between two stools yet were this the work of an unknown writer it would be meritorious and promising as it is we look rather for achievement than promise the book is a painstaking and wellwrought experiment but we think the author would be well advised to follow faithfully what appears to be his own natural bent his dartmoor farming lore is most attractive reading and his conversations between labourers and their kind are excellent,englishfiction

journalists we shall not dispute the correctness of their judgment especially as the  scottish orphans gives us a very favourable opinion of the talents of its author the tale relates to a family who were out in the fortyfive that is participating in the rebellion of 145 the father of the scottish orphans was executed at carlisle as a rebel  his wife sunk under the grief of her situation and died a few days before the execution of her husband  the three orphans who had been imprisoned with tilt ir parents were rescued by an old domestic of the family who brought tlieuiupinsecresy until the eldest having obtained the patronage of a gentleman who had come to live in the neighbourhood procured a commission in the army andbut we know no more for here the tale abruptly terminates waiting till the fair author has leisure to furnish a second part of the history for the consolation however of such as mav feel uneasy respecting the fate of the orphans mrs blackford kindly assures us of their contilined prosperity and that the veil of mystery which hangs over this part of the narrative will then be removed although their tale is not complete vet it will be read with interest as conm  taming a very pleasing narrative and iiculeatinijf the best of moral duties he shall make one extract relating to the rescuing the orphans from prison by the servant william mathieson   the moment william thought he could speak without being heard he informed mr monteith heiad learned that an order for his removal had been given and that in two days he feared he would lie taken from stirling on his way to england to be tried af carlisle  that he had discovered that colonel monteith had had interest enough to be allowed to detain the children under the pretence of taking care of them and that strict orders had been given to the governor of the castle not to salier them or mrs monleitli to cpiit the prison till after his reuval  but my dear good master continued william seeing mr monteith

you must remain till i return from edinbiugh  and then xve may bc able to contrive some method of getting vou on board of a ship and out of the country as quickly as possible  mr monteith shook his

risking and you may depend on finding me ready at the hour you have mimed to attempt to put the plan in execution  william endeavoured to persuade his master to attempt his own deliverance but mr monteith felt convinced that instant death must be the consequence if he did so and the fear of adding to his poor xvi fes sufferings by making her a witness to such a dreadful catastrophe weighed against all the arguments his faithful servant could urge and when the jailor summoned wiliam from the presence of his master he xva fenced to leave the prison without having the slightest hope of being able to save bim   mr monteith communicated to his j xvife so much of xvhat w iiiiaui had told  him as reconciled her to tiie plan of iel  ting the children down irom the window william ha i

getting them through the bars of the windoxv and in persuading them to be quiet the whole night was occupied in making preparations after almost despairing of success mr monteith felt the bar shake in bis hand and a fexv minutes before william appeared he had the satisfaction of removing it sufficiently to permit the largest of the boys to get through  the moment this xvas accomplished mis monteith began to prepare the children though the agony she endured both from parting xvith them for the lirt time in her life aud from the danger he could not help seeing they ran in eae of any unforeseen accident happening to tlu rope during tiieir descent rendered her scarcely able to complete her task mr monteith xvas not much more composed himself as he lirnily believed whauxer might be his success in letting them down safely he was now parting from them for the last time the two youngest allen and jessie xvere too young to be at all aware of xvhat xvas passing allen being little more than two

molly bawn lcty bavrn by thc author of  phyllis london smith and elder we must commence by drawing a distinction between a coquette and a flirt lest such praises as we are inclined to bestow upon the heroine of this book should bc misunderstood and interpreted as approval of the general practises of flirtation a coquet ti1 likes admiration anel so does a flirt and both of them are induced to go out of their way to seek it but the coquette seeks admiration and strives to make herself attractive rather for the sake of flattering her own vanity and of being a focus of attraction to the other sex the flirts ulterior aim is to win love which she does not reciprocate it is for this that she courts admiration when she has won the love at which she has been aiming she is content to throw it away and to seek a new conquest the coquette need not have any arrure pewee of winning real affection homage not love is what she craves if she finds that she has unwittingly won the latter she is apt to draw in her horns and tobe dismayed at the results of her folly she likes attentions but not intentions and admiration without affection the two terms are often used synonymously yet if a difle renee does exist it is such as we have stated the flirt is heartless and selfish thc coquette impulsive anel vain but nothing worse having thus defined we may premise that molly bawn is a thorough lil le coquette her coquetry may almost bc called artless yet coquetry it undoubtedly is she is pretty aud she is aware of the fact what young lady is so gifted anel withal unconsious of her endowmentr her temperament is foreshadowed in the opening chapter where she and her halibrother and sisterinlaw are awaiting the arrival of the guest who is to be mollys fate hereafter tired of waiting for this late arrival molly stares at herself in a glass and laments that she has  taken such pains with her hair and attire generally then she says to her brother  john since t hero is no one else to admire nie do say whether you think it or net i am the prettiest person you ever saw molly strikes up a warm friendship with the newcomer luttrell within a few hours of his arrival she at once confesses herself overjoyed at his arrival but the reason she assigns is characteristic of herif you only knew as well as 1 do the terrible neverending dullness of this place you would undtstand how one could long for the coming of any tii like congreves fair amoret molly is coquette aad cy at once she likes to be admired and to receive att nt lons  she might doubtless would lee styled forward by ni 1 ni ii ls and straitlaced people but she is coy of winning love and even at tie idea of awakening it yet she recounts t  luttrell with narre candour the diverse proposals which she even at nineteen has already received from the successive imiits of the parish and other admirers luttrell is soon hopehvsly in love yet it is some time before molly reciprocates his affections but a temporary tiff between them brings malters to a climax and he proposes she accepts him ritt somo momentary hesitation but shows thc real ntate of ber feelings when she says to bc made love to always every day would hill me ncverthc less they are engaged and before luttrell leaves moll receives an invitation to visit her grandfather a wealthy landed proprietor wdiom old age ill health and illtemper combined have made a misanthropical tyrant mollys mother committed a mesalliance as an amherst in old mr amhersts eyes when she became the second wife of mr massercene an irish gentleman of small means and though she was his favourite daughter he foreswore all further communication with her till now he has ignored molly and two other grandchildren marcia amherst and philip shadwell stand highest in his good graces waiting eagerly to stand in his shoes when he shall pass over to the majority these two have engaged themselves to each other the old man realises the motives of their devotion to him and his goodwill is not increased by the discovery of a halffinished letter from marcia to her mother lamenting her grandfathers tenacity of life nor by learning that shadwell is speculating upon his expectations by means of post obits molly soon carries all before her at herst royal where luttrell soon joins the party her coquetry conquers shadwell and also one plantagenet potts whose name and characteristics of ugliness and gooel nature are hardly original we fear molly is however pained when she finds that she has wron philip shadwells love and strives to keep him at a distance luttrell is naturally jealous and wc are afraid to say how many lovers quarrels are recorded between them thrice at least in thc course of the book is their engagement broken off only to be speedily renewed with increased warmth when molly coaxingly rubs her cheek against lu trolls sleeve like a spaniel courting a caress the citadel surrenders unconditionally we can hardly say that we should like a sister or daughter of ours to play the hoyden as does molly lest wrorse should befall them  and yet we must confess that there is a charin in the wayward and coquettish heroine which makes us condone as soon as we have censured when her love has once been really kindled she is devoted to luttrell though the latters expectations are meagre while philip shadwell her cousin is heir presumptive to the twenty thousand a year of herst royal so soon as his grandfather shall be good enough to take his departure we cannot say that molly is an unnatural character we have actually known girls more or less like her whose coquetry was only skin deep and whose affection was wann trusting sincere and honest it is part of the licence of an author to combine this amount of eccentricity of character with faultlessness of face and figure and with a voice that entrances all who hear her sing admitting that a molly bawn is a possible though a very rare occurrence in life we may then say that the story has a natural and unaffected tone throughout and that thc reality of the conversations and predicaments and thc absemcc of artificiality in thc other characters which compose the setting to this jewel are quite refreshing after thc amount of trashy novels which it has been our fate to wade through of late if the tone of the conversations were less natural and thc pictures less artistically drawn molly might at once appear a flirt whose good points were inconsistent with her predilections there is no striking incident throughout thc book  the interest depends upon the vivacity of the narration to which we give all credit thc several walking gentlemen and ladies play their parts well and keep the piece going admirably there is a good comedy of errors wherein a sir penthony stafford has to woo and win his own wife whom he has married without previous acquaintance and under a special agreement that so soon as the ceremony was over they should separate for ever a curious will of an uncle which made their marriage the sole condition of succeeding to his estate is thc reason assigned for this eccentric arrangement but wc must parenthetically state that legally the conditions would have been inoperative in the absence of specific trusts of which the author makes no mention this sort of will is a favourite though impossible resource of novelists how molly breaks her silken fetters with luttrell only to rivet them anew how her brother dies suddenly and leaves her and his family destitute how she disdain her grandfathers offer that she shall live with him al his heiress and leave her sisterinlaw to starve how 6he becomes a star upon the stage of the concertroom in order to support his brothers wielow and family  how in the end she find herself mistress of herst royal anel the inevitable sequel results we recommend our readers to study for themselves the book though it portrays coquetry is singularly free from the least soupcon of coarseness and would not corrupt a girl in her teens which is a good deal to be able to say of any modern novel which at the same time has though faculty of being clever and amusing,englishfiction

i a w1him and its consequences in 3 vols london i   smitbelder and co one of the most brilliant fictions the season has pro duced but remarkable rather for coinposition than for the story the authors style is singularly vigorous and graphic he wastes no words condenses his thoughts and accomplishes by a single happy touch what writers of less genius employ a paragraph to elaborate it is evident that though as yet nameless an aspirant has stepped into the arena of literature who will ere long win for himself a conspicuous place lie has all the elements of success and only practice is wanted for their perfection his plot however is less entitled to praise its prominent features are borrowed from the stock incidents of the circulating library every one is familiar to the novelreaderthe gypsy warningsthe murder and the trial the whim that possesses a gentleman to assume the character of gardener that he may make acquaintance with the true character of a lower class of society these are hackneyed themes and would have consigned a whim and its consequences to speedy oblivion but for the original manner in which they are narrated character too is drawn with a few strokes of the pen so as to be distinctly comprehended and whether he attempts humour or pathos the author is equally happy in rousing the sympathies of his readers this sparkling style will be best exhibited by a few extracts and we are sure that all who read them will be desirous of perusing the work itself therefore the libraries may order it with assurance of a demand we last week presented a glowing appeal in behalf of the press from mr mitchell ilere is one no less i truthful the press in england the young gentlemans eye rested first upon one of those eloquent and masterly leading articles where all the powers of language and the acuteness of human reason sharpened by art and use are employed to give a peculiar view of some passing subject in what may well be called an essay which if mental labour and literary merit ever obtained reward in england would raise the writer far above the great body of those who are honoured by the crown and paid by the nation the vigour the subtlety the eloquence aye and the wisdom of many passages captivated the mind of chandos winslow but they brought a sad moral with them he had dreamed of employing his own talents in the world of letters of seeking fame and recompense by mental exertion but he now asked himself who is it wrote this splendid essay  what has been his reward in life  who will ever hear of him a what will be his future fate a man who can shake public opinion to its foundation who can rule and command the minds of millions by the sceptre of genius will live unhonoured but by a few unrewarded except by the comparatively small remuneration which even such a journal as this the 7ymes can afford and die forgotten print calico twist cotton paint portraits feel pulses plead causes bad and good cut throats do any thing but follow a course which in england is luxurious to the rich and great thorny and stony to all else we are a great commercial people we are a nation of shopkeepers and even in the distribution of honours and rewards those who have them to dispose of expect their material pennyworth in return mind is nothing in great britain except as it is employed upon matter as a specimen of his humorous powers take his very lively essay on noses let us write an essay upon noses each organ of the human body but more especially an organ of sensation has a sort of existence aparta separate sphere of being from the

victor and vanquished by mary cecil hay 3 vols hurst fc blackett the great feature in  victor and vanquished is the extreme mobility of lip which characterises the actors ladies and gentlemen alike are found with quivering trembling and shaking lips the moment their feelings undergo the slightest shock as the story is highly sensational and situations more or less ex ting abound these good people go through fe with many contortions of countenance here is also a great deal of crying and kissing id a general want of selfrespect among the laracters the most remarkable episode in ie tale is the death of the hero who makes ie edifying end usually allotted to the conimptive young lady this gentleman is the ghtful heir to a baronetcy who having been njustly sentenced to penal servitude the snnexion of ideas seems curiously close in dine minds is now out on a ticketofleave nd is ensconced in a cottage at high ithelston on his family estate here he is ccupied partly in saving money to pay off he sum supposed to have been lost by his orgery partly in educating the son of the eal culprit who has been deserted by his ather himself a resident in the immediate leighbourhood gerard is also endeavouring o prove his legitimacy and to oust the eigning baronet these occupations are lowever unhappily interrupted by a chance neeting between gerard and the villain relfrey when the former pitches the latter into m old mineshaft in a lake with the apparent esult of drowning him it requires no great istuteness to opine that so profligate a villain vas not born to be drowned in fact the jvhole thing has been planned by him with a riew to gerards conviction of his murder and iris own escape from a neighbourhood which was becoming embarrassing the result is a remarkable trial in which all known laws of evidence are set aside and gerard is acquitted of au act which is sworn to by three eyewitnesses in consequence of the spirited declamation of an old woman who proves that the prisoner is a very good fellow and the deceased no better than he should be we do not complain of technical inaccuracy  few novelists know as well as dickens that  what the soldier said isnt evidence  but we are appalled at the suggestion of long independent speeches by the different witnesses in addition to the chartered libertinism of counsel with this episode the interest reaches its climax gerard of course proves his legitimacy and soon after dies his sister marries sir neil athelston his successor in whose house she has been a governess under a feigned name and who showed her the true touch of the quality of fictitious baronets by offering to seduce her when he thought she was unprotected miss marjorie castillain to whom he was engaged at that time consoles herself with a colonel of much gravity and wisdom that gentleman no doubt has his work before him for a more unnatural sister and daughter than this hoydenish damsel it is impossible to conceive indeed with the possible exception of the colonel there is not a lady or gentleman in the book,englishfiction
the spanish match or charles stuart at madrid  nn ittail rw  t ll by william harrison ainsworth chapman and hall the  house of seven chimneys has for some months been exciting the lovers of romanoe in bentleys miscellany and the story being concluded reappears with the above title mr ainsworth has long held undisputed sway as grand master of historical narrative and this his latest work is a valuable addition to the series which he has provided for that class of readers who delight in the romance of history and of these there is even now we are happy to observe no want it might be regretted that the tide has ceased to set in favour of this style of literature were it not that the author of these three exciting and pleasant volumes has a monopoly in it and is unapproachable in his treatment of incidents well known but which in hie hands obtain a fresh and delightful novelty mr ainsworths historical novels have always the great merit of being the work of a man whose interest in details of the past is strong and whose points of local and historical colouring are accurate as any antiquary could desire while he remains true in spirit to the stir and bustle and the very phrasing of the school of romance in which he graduated long ago with firstclass honours the freshness of his treatment of old themes is very noticeable few readers for instance are ignorant of the sentimental journey of charles in search of a wife yet the way in which mr ainsworth takes advantage of a readymade tale is so skilful that it is impossible not to read it with an interest ever springing and entirely new this is a remarkable faculty possessed by the author who has led many youthful students entranced by his manner of relating facts to seek in authentic records a confirmation of the narrative which has so enthralled their imagination this is no small merit and one which since the great sir walter few can claim we welcome therefore this royal romance of real life and follow the adventures of the chivalrous prince and his companions with infinite amusement and pleasure and are convinced that the book will be one of the author8 most popular productions in these days of dramatic adaptation we feel convinced that any enterprising manager would find in mr ainsworths picturesque volumes ample material of bullfights processions and tournaments for a gorgeous spectacle combined with a very interesting lovestory the story opens with king jamess perplexity as to the chances of the spanish match succeeding and by the daring and promptitude of buckingham whose character is admirably kept up throughout the important decision is arrived at that the heir apparent shall have his desire and cross the seas in quest of his lady love the adventurers meet with their first peril directly they reach the french shore jack and tom are the names chosen by the prince and buckingham just at the hour of two in the afternoon they entered the harbour of boulogne and after some little delay were permitted by the officers of the port to disembark and charles for the first time set foot in france cottington having concluded all arrangements with captain pynchen before landing jack and tom underwent no detention on that score but followed by a couple of sailors carrying their baggage proceeded to the ecu dor in the grande rue where they were welcomed by a very civil landlord who told them they were too late for the table dhdte but considerately added that he could speedily set an excellent dinner before them this was agreed to but the dinner was not served so promptly as promised and being copious took some time to discuss consequently it was hard upon four oclock before the travellers were in the saddle attended by two gailydressed postilions wearing enormous jackboots and who made the quay eoho with the claogour of their horns they rode out of boulogne and crossing a wooden bridge over the liane took the road to montreuil where they proposed to pass the night and where they arrived without accident or interruption about seven oclock and took up their quarters at the tele de bceuf renowned for its pates de becassines rising betimes next morning they were all on horseback soon after seven and on the way to amiens which they determined to make the limit of that days journey all the party were in high spirits to charles the novelty of travelling in a foreign land was exciting and though the country through which he rode was uninteresting in a picturesque point of view in his present frame of mind it became invested with charms such as many a really beautiful landscape had not revealed to him fortunately the weather was fine and the state of the roads good so that the travellers got on without annoyance a joyous company they wereas joyous and lighthearted aa any that bad preceded them on the aame route whether it was change of clime and scene or the excitement they had previously undergone that occasioned this gaiety none cared to inquire being perfectly satisfied with the result even sir francis cottington who had been so strongly averse to the expedition yielded to the enlivening influences and began to view the project with a hopeful eye though maintaining hia habitual gravity of look charles at heart was as gleeful as his companions never had be been more entirely free from the melancholy which usually oershadowed himnever was the present more void of gloom iever did the future look brighter sometimes in order to indulge in fit of pleasant musingto dwell upon the charms of his mistressto conjure up the idea ot their first interview and his transports on beholding herhe would ride apart from the othersbut he soon returned to join in their lively chat in this manner they advanced on their journey scarcely aware how much they had accomplished after skirting the forest of crecy close to which the famous hattie was won by edward iii the thought of which roused the warlike spirit of charles and made him burn for the military renown of the black prince they descended into the vale of the 8oue and traversed it till they reached abbeville har they alighted at tba htteld la fast litislil  ta

bava recently been in england and during our stay visited your famous raoeoouree at newmarket while there we hsd tite singular satisfaction of beholding bia hiahneas the prince of wales and tba lord marquis of buckingham wa saw them nkmaieiixor perhaps i ought to say milordsufficiently loog to enable ua to study their features carefully and fix them upon our memory you trill not ba surprised then monsieur when we declare that in two of your party who have just gone in arith the landlord we conoeive that wa recognise prinoe charles and the lord marquis i take what you say as a great compliment to my friends messieurs returned graham without the slightest embejttasmeot but you are mistaken the gentlemen to whom you refer are very humble individualstwo brothers the mesaieur smith they certainly bear some resemblance to the illustrious personages you have mentionedenough perhaps to deceive a stranger  the resemblance ia too striking in both instances to admit of doubt upon the point observed m de nouvion  of course it is not for us to make a remark if the prinoe of walea and the lord marquis choose to travel incognito  i will speedily convince you of your error messieurs interrupted graham and stepping within the doorway he shouted u hola jack and tom come hither for a moment i pray of you at this summons jack and tom immediately came out of the salle a manger into which they had been ushered by the host and jsck eaid as if addressing an equal  what do you want with us dick   these gentlemen will have it that you are the prinoe of wales and my lord of buckingham replied graham  pray undeceive them for they will not credit my denial you do us too much honour messieursfsr too much observed jack  it is not however the first time that my brother tom and myself have been taken for the important personages in question  i should think not said m marcellin  the resemblance is rather unlucky for us remarked tom  it has more than once got us into difficulties  i can easily imagine it rejoined de noovion sceptically  it must be unpleasant also for the prince and the lord marquis to be mistaken a they might be accidentally for you and your brother m jack smith of course you have seen my lord of buckingham monsieur he added  oh yes i have seen him returned tom  we have seen both him and the prince eb jack   frequently returned jack  then you may possibly bave remarked as i did returned m de nouvion  that the marquis wears a ring on the first finger of the right handprecisely such a ring as yours m tom 8tnith while the prince has a brooch the counterpart of which fastens the cloak of your brother jack   a 8 fast as the lively party ride onwards adventures pour in upon them and there is no lack of peril and danger to surmount by their ready wit and fearless courage mr ainsworth must have visited the land he describes so well and we predict that his work will be admitted as one of the best guides for travellers to madrid in future just as sir walters romance of the loire was accepted in that locality we are not sure that archie armstrong was really tossed by a bull in the presence of the infanta but as every character introduced is known to history and most of the incidents did really happen we are content to take that episode for granted and laugh in good faith the pretty appearance of the dove is not imaginary and although it misled the sentimental prince into false hope seemed made expressly to heighten the effect of a love scene and is duly seized upon by the acute romancer charles arrived at madrid after escaping brigands and inconvenient recognitions at length sees the object of his wishes of the meeting between chaelbs and thb xneaeta mabia the old palacio beal of madrid to which our story refers must not be confounded with the existing palace which comparatively speaking is a modern building being only completed about a hundred yean ago the ancient structure was in fact the moorish alcarar and bad been the abode of the caliphs till they were driven from new castille to granada it waa first occupied as a palace by enrique iv towards the close of the fifteenth oentury but few changes were made in it till the time of charles v when the pile was partially rebuilt and enlarged and its original character materially destroyed philip ii may be said to be the first christian monarch who dwelled within the alcazar of madrid for until the completion of the eeoorial in 1584 he made it his chief residence not till the reign of thia gloomy monarch did madrid itself become the capital of spain and from the same epoch must be dated the importance of the city few changes were made in the alcazar by philip iii who was perfectly content with thepalaee bequeathed to bim by bit illustrious sire and philip iv had as yet been too short a time on tba throne to attempt any improvements though heterogeneous in its architecture and certainly not so beautiful as it bad been in the days of its moslem rulers the roysl palace of madrid was a vast and magnificent pile occupying a most commanding position on the heights overlooking the valley of the manzanares immediately beneath the royal edifice extending from the foot of the eminence on which it stood to the banks of the river was the campo del moro part of which was laid out as gardens viewed cither from the grand plaza from the valley or from afar the palsce presented a moat striking and picturesque appearance it was entered by two moorish gates the beautiful architecture of which was happily undisfigured and the buildings surrounding the spacious court were studded with cupolas and minarets above these towered the ancient keep with its zigzag battlements and turret at each angle besides a number of small courts th palace comprehended a superb patio surrounded by apartments laid out in the arabian style charles disguised as a page is conducted by gondomar from tba corridor the count and the newlymade page proceeded through a variety of paseages up and down staircases until they tame to a superb suite of rooms the windows of which gondomar informed bis companion overlooked the valley of the manzanares all these were lighted up but there was no company within them only a few attendants standing near the open doora who bowed respectfully a gondomar pasted on at length tba count and his cxmipanion came to a grand

the sheriff of dyke hole by ridgwvell cullum 6s chapman  hall although it is not a matter of great difficulty to deduce the plot of mr cullums new book from its opening chapters this in no way detracts from its interest the subtitle the story of a legacy pretty well describes it dick rovdon is left two millions on condition that lie discovers a certain silver mine in montana which at one time belonged to his benefactor and that he also finds out the whereabouts of that benefactors wife or daughter and instals her as owner of the mine on arrival at dyke hole he makes a muddle of things and presents the holder of the mine with the only map by which it may be located it is at once clear to the reader that this mans honesty is very doubtful and of course in the end this is proved to be the case roydon also meets a water nymph otherwise an attractive local resident with whom he promptly becomes infatuated there is also the character of the book the sheriff and the desperado kate who eventually turns out to be the missing daughter mr cullum does not fail in manufacturing an adequate plot out of these materials the greater part of the book however is concerned with the manners and customs of dyke hole and with the delightfully terrifying figure of its sheriff whose bon mzots are as numerous as they are humorous the author is especially successful in catching the atmosphere of a somewhat exaggerated  wild west and in every way his new novel is most attractive it is a book of high spirits and it is also one of the funniest and most delightful novels that we have read for some time  the sheriff of dyke hole by ridgwell culham chapman  hall the scene of this sensational melodrama which evinces considerable power and skill hes round a mining village in montana the highly unconventional manners and customs of the male inhabitants and their neighbours will entertain readers who do not object to abstruse slang and lurid forms of emphasis the sheriff is a masterful person who revels in fighting and is a shrewd detective but he is honest and warmhearted his portrait is so elaborately drawn that the author could give only comparatively meagre sketches of the leading lady and her lover,englishfiction
the finances of sir john kynnersley by a c fox davies john lane 6s mr foxdavies is a most ingenious man and it is to be hoped for the sake of the security of property that he will be content to confine his ingenuity to the manufacture of fiction and not himself practice the brilliant frauds and swindles which he ascribes to his hero for brilliant in conception as the various frauds are which help to consolidate the finances of sir john kynnersley the skill with which he covers his trail and renders detection impossible is even more brilliant ihe main idea of the book is revenge sir john has been let in to the extent of his whole fortune by an israelitish financiermoses ikestein  and he determines to get his own back with interest added this he succeeds in doing in various ways each more galling than the last and not only does he manage to hurt the jew in pocket but he also adds insult to the injury by making his victim supremely ridiculous in the end ikestein stung beyond all endurance is bold enough to prosecute sir john with fraud but the latter has been so careful of every detail that not a single one of the halfdozen charges can be brought home to him and his counsel secures him a triumphant acquittal altogether sir john collects about 6ooooo and retires into an honest private life with the girl of his choice whose story forms the last and most exciting chapter in the book the most noticeable point in the book is perhaps the skill with which mr foxdavies succeeds in keeping the readers sympathy for his disreputable hero it is not that sir john is especially fascinating  he is when all is said and done a very ordinary characterclever resourceful and determined but in spite of his scoundrelism and dishonesty he remains a  gentleman to use a banal word for want of a better and the reader forgives his dishonesty at times even is inclined to hold him justified if fur no other reason the book should win success for its sheer audacity it should also stamp mr foxdavies as a writer of clear imagination and no little skill both in devising a plot and in its execution,englishfiction

novels the dukes cahihren by anthony trollope chapman and hall limited london in his last novel mr trollope pursues his old plan of bringing many of the familiar and absurdlynamed characters of former works again on to the scene a few die and fresh ones immediately take their place but the haunts they frequent the society they mingle in and the manners they adopt show but little variation the dukes children  of course keeps the reader almost exclusively in those upper circles which mr trollope describes and loves so well we are introduced immediately after the poor duchess of omnium has died and we find the poor duke plunged in grief not only is he heartbroken at the loss of his wife but he is dismayed at the prospect of having to look after his daughter lady mary palliser aged nineteen he takes counsel of mrs phineas finn his late wifes most intimate friend and she advises that a companion should be found for lady mary the duke proposes that mrs finn should be the companion for the time being at any rate but to this plan the latter is strongly disinclined because she suspects that lady mary has formed an attachment for a gentleman whom the duke would certainly not approve of asa husband forhis daughter hersuspicions turn out to have been well founded lady mary confesses to her that she loves mr francis tregear the gentlem3n in question who will only have fifteen hundred a year when his mother dies when mrs finn learns this she tells lady mary that she mrs finn must inform the duke at once unless mr tregear will save her the trouble then with lady marys consent she determines to see mr tregear and talk to him on the subject we may say at once that mr tregear has no disqualification for being the soninlaw even of the duke of omnium except that he is poornd has no title he is a gentleman highly educated extremely handsome and the intimate friend of lord silverbridge the dukes eldest son even the duchess had smiled on his suit but now she is dead and gone so mrs finn goes to see tregear they have a long conversation the end of which is that tregear against his will is persuaded into promising that he will tell the duke of his love for lady mary within a week and he fulfils his promise he enters the dukes studio one evening  looking beautiful as apollo as he stood upright before his wishedfor fatherinlaw the duke however is not sufficiently overcome by his appearance to entertain his proposal for one instant when he has got over his surprise at tregeares astounding audacity he simply replies  of course it is impossible you are not so ignorant but that you must have known as much when you came to me but tregear will not admit that it is impossible and they proceed to argue the matter out the dukes non possurnus prevails in the end however and tregear after having let out that ms finn was aware of the young peoples attachment is dismissed with a curt  good morning sir a form of adieu which testifies to the dukes confusion of mind it being at the time 6 pm the duke soon afterwards sees his daughter and tells her also that it is impossible but she is just as difficult to convince as tregear she will not even promise not to write to tregear though she declares that should she feel obliged to do so she will tell her father what she has written the duke is discomfited but he determines to hand lady mary over to some stern female friend who would aid him in preventing the contemplated ilsaliance while these events are occurring the reader is taken with lord silverbridge to the beargarden club and there made acquainted with several other scions of the nobility as well as major ti to a sporting associate of the dukes son then a little later on we make the acquaintance of lady mabel grex a rather basese young beauty the daughter of earl grex a shabby genteel and somewhat scandalous old nobleman it is soon apparent that lord silverbridge is half inclined to fall in love with lady mabel presently the reader is permitted to see that lady mabel is in love with frank tregear although she will not own to it the truth is they had very nearly been engaged once and would have been quite if lady mabel had not seen that for two paupers as she described frank and herself to think of marrying would be absurd and now frank tregear has fallen in love with somebody else and though it was her own doing lady mabel cannot but feel wounded that her lover should take her so readily at her word and now she is resolved to have lord silverbridge who seems nothing loth yet on one occasion when he almost proposes to her she almost tells him she will not have him but she feels sure that he will not be content with this answer and when he next asks her she will accept him but she has not reckoned on the appearance of a certain miss isabel boncassen a very beautiful american heiress who with her father and mother now comes on the scene lord silverbridge is at once captured by the new belle and of course as the duke is horrified at the thought of his eldest son marrying an american whose materr al parent says 11oh laws  and the like further complications at once ensue additional interest is given to the development of the plot by the introduction of various subsidiary episodes there are some election scenes occasioned by lord silverbridge going into parliament sporting readers will be interested in the chapters devoted to horseracing and the manner in which lord silverbridge is sold by his friend major tifto but the main purpose of the story is to show how the duke of omniums children fell in love with people of inferior station to themselves how their father quarrelled with them for so doing and how in the end the noble family were reconciled mr trollope tells this story with fluency but whether after all it is worth the telling is another matter mr trollopes great fault as apparent as ever in his last work is the superficiality of his characters it is impossible to feel any real interest in their fortunes or in the storms in teacups which the authoreis perpetually rousing frank tregear shows only one conspicuous quality from first to last and that is his determination to marry lady mary the converse of this may be said with equal truth of the dukes daughter no reader will have any doubt regarding the ultimate end of the lovers difficulties which end by the way is exceedingly tame when it does come the story of the dukes injustice to mrs finn fills several pages and is told with great circumlocution but not a particle of interest attaches to the imbroglio the only person in the book for whom any real sympathy can be felt is lady mabel grex with all her faults she is womanly and has to endure real suffering tregears treatment of her is as cruel as it is unnatural  i i i moreover it seems to us as much a mistake to wake lady mabel so far forget herself as to actually ask lord silverbridge to marry her as to afterwards allow her to tell him that she never loved him yet despite these blemishes in her character the sympathies of most readers will be with lady mabel especially as she is the only person in the book who is left

the history of matthew wald i i e i f is no feature in which the novels of our age liffer more from those of the last than in the speculative and ideal cast which they have assuned the bustling plots crowded with incidentsthe characters leveloping themselves only in action the brief and meagre descriptions the system which considered subjert as every thing and execution a matter of comparative insignificance have been supplanted by more intellectual and we cannot help thinking more interesting views plots have become simple even to poverty the province of action has been narrowed to extend that of thought feeling has become the mainspring of interest and its analyses and expression the test of talent descriptions of external nature have become more graphical and mi nnte and their connexion with the business of the taleas influencing by their secret but sensible power the feelings of the agentsis better understood and rendered more effective and available the first of these systems certainly indicates a want of refined feeling in the public it was altogether of a meaner and more mechanical castit addressed itself to a lower class of feelings and might have been acted on by minds of no deep feeling and even of scanty invention for though the process of creating an original story is one of no trifling effort the task of combination or disjunction is not a difficult one and a very slight acquaintance with the history of fiction enables us to see how frequently the composition of these novels of incident has been a work of alteration rather than invention they had one advantage however in the very mediocrity of the principle on which they were constructed they were seldom tiresome if the reader perused them with little of that deep thrillin interest which he now feels we have no doubt he yawned less also if he wept lessbe laughed more there were fewer chances of failure for the effect of a sequence of ludicrous or striking incidents admitted of little variation and in the hands of an author of the greatest or the most slender talent produced only a pleasure differing a little in degree but the more ambitious system of modern novelists while it renders the power of genius more visible and vindicates more certainly its lreeminence over mediocrity makes the works of the lesser herd utterly wretched and intolerable destitute of those hum bler attractions of plot and incident which they might have attained andl filled with ludicrous and impotent straining after those more magnificent qualities which it is hopeless for them to emulate or aspire to the present work has nothing to do however with these it belongs to the higher class and if we wished to prove the superiority of that principle of effect on which our modern tales are constructed we know not where we should find a better example wdith a plot of a grosslydefective kindwith few incidentsfew characters of importance and one the most interesting of these appearing only and disappearing as in a dreamwith little aid from humour and less from the mere paint ing of external nature in short by the mere force and grandeur of individual scenes and the general eloquence and beauty of the writing this tale creates and maintains the deepest and most vivid interest and we close it at last with those feelings of dreariness and desolation with which we peruse the remorse of caleb williams or the settled gloom of st leon after his final parting with his son often in the course of the story we feel the unsatisfactory na ture of some of the incidentsthe want of connectionof explanation theunreasonablesupinenessof some of the characters at one time and their fiery and needless impatience at others with a multitude of et cetera but still we are hurried along by the impetuosity of the narrative and it is only when we have fairly finished that we have time to think of all the authors offences against consistency and to wonder how with so many faults obvious to every one we should have so yielded to its influence but the truth is aw this only shews how little sucl things 4 d weigh in the balance of excellence and how easily the atoning power of genius can efface such errors the author is evidently a man of great talent his humour to be sure we do not much like but his pathos his scenes of passion and his eloquence are of the highest kind his conception of character we estimate more highly from his reginald dale tonne than from the present work yet even here there is a wonderful effect about his sketches his females we have always thought particularly captivating athanasia was very good andl helen hesketh admirable of the heroine of this tale we see almost nothingsbe is remorselessly married in the beginning and passes only once before our eyes until the conclusionand yet even this unsubstantial pageant has something about it that lingers in our memory another beautiful and quiet female is opposed to her gentle affectionate and tinged with religious melan choly and her character is touched with the same chaste and powerful pencil wald himself we cannot help thinking disagreeable and none of the subordinate agents of the story are particularly interesting but we suppose the reader would rather form his own opinion and though it is difficult to select any pasage that can give a proper idea of the characteristic vigour of the book we shall extract a few of the shortest accompanying them only by such a notice as to render them intelligible the story is related like those of godwin in the first person an arrangement well suited to such tales as depend for their effect on the expose of feeling and particularly to those where the narrator poees no extraordinary qualities euther of evil or good and may therefore detail bin feeings without any great violation of modesty on the one hand or of wba bility on the other matthew wald is te descendant of a family et norman extraction which had settlaed in scotland

his cousln katharine among the woods and glens of blackford the first interruption to his gaiety is occasioned by the marriage of his aunt with a mr matber who had been tutor in the family and who soon begins to curtail his amusements and to treat him with harshness an in cilent of this kind which young wald revenges with a ferocity above his years leads to his removal to the university of st andrews where he quietly spends two winters in pursuing his studies a sudden resolution strikes him to revisit blackford and it is here that the real interest of the tale begins his feelings when on his arrival he finds a general appearance of restraint and coldness and the attentions of his cousin and his aunt devoted to a fashionable in mate of the housethe honourable mr lascelynethe succession of little incidents trifling in themselves that work upon and irritate his tem per are imagined and executed with great art and probability the fli nishing stroke is given by a discovery which appears to him to confirm his suspicions of katharines attachment to lascelyne and with a promptitude which by the way forms an unnatural contrast to that unresisting irresolute conduct which he dis plays

out and finding the morning fine was tempted to go on i can say i hated the thoughts of taking leavethat at least will be true enough i had opened one of thie windowshut ters and i now thought it would be as well to close it again as i was walking on tiptoe across the room my eye fell on two little black profiles of katharine and myself that we had sat for to an itinerant limner when we were children and which had ever since hung over the chim neypiece i took katharines off the nail and held it for a minute or two in my hand but the folly of the thing flashed upon me in a moment and i re placed it her worktable was by the window and i was so idle as to open the drawer of it a blue sash was the first thing i saw and i stuffied it like a thief into my bosom i then barred the win dow

and the party began to move towards the parlour i stepped backwards that all might pas and beholdamong the first a lady a young and graceful lady arrayed in the deepest sables the room was darkish but the figure the gait the profilei saw them au distinctly with slow and stately steps katharine wald glided by me she passed the doorher long black train floated over the threshold i was in a dream yet my eyes pernsed evey form that followedand at last i was alone and i had seen no lascelyn i cannot say what my feelings were i followed the last of the company as it i had been dragged bya chain i would have bounded up the staircase but the serants were all arranged in the blazing hall  and i creptm stole into the din ingroom my eye glanaed once just once round the room and i began to breathe again when i found that i had hedged myself in at the bottom of the table on the same side towards the up perend of which she had taken her aest but i was completely in a drea the lights the crowd the butthey found me and they left me alone if i ate and drank i was no more aware of what i was doing than the silver or glass before me there was a ringing in my ears a diziness on my brain i knew not whether i had lived an hour or a minute when my neighbours rose and i per ceived that the ladies were about to withdraw instinctively i kept my face to the table and fixed my eyes on the opposite wallthe side of the room along which she was wot to pass i was fixedi was a statue and yet i trembled to the bone to think that perhaps the skirt of her gar ment might be rubbing the back of my chaireven of my coat she had hap pened to take the other way she appeared right before my eyesi had not power to avert them on she cameshe caught my dead gaze full and i saw a sudden tremour agitate every fibre in her glorious frame she opened her lips and instantly compressed them again as if they had been frozen it was the work of a momentless than a moment she walked on the door was closed upon the last of them i had met those eyes once morewho could ever read their hazel depths it was katharinethe same katharinethe same unapproachable ineffable loveliness and yet how chan ged in aspect

course did not i was rming for breath and i made my way at once to the open air i stood i daresay r half an hour propped against the wall just beyond the door it was a dark windy n4igt and the old trees about the bhse were groaning and th leaves fall ing thick about m sdenly two horsemen came canter ia coe by me the first reined his horse and the light from the hall stream ed full upon laseelynes face he dis mounted and i could not but hear what he said to his groom  tell them said he  that your lady will require the car riage immediately after breakfast in the morning mty horses at the same time for we have a longish sttage tomorrow  yes my lord said the man and i saw the one enter the house and the other take the way towards the stables i prowled about the woods a while and then denned myself in my garret and i need scarcely say that i did not honour the distinguished company with my presence at their breakfasttable next morning but how acute was my ear how distinctly did i hear the carriage steps slap and the wheels begin to roll the death of sir claud breaks up the party wald commences sur geon in the county town in the neigh bourhood and joanne retires to the residence of that old servant who had related her story to matthew wald the following is the picture of their retirement and of one of the visits of wald i deferred this visit therefore till the last evening of my stay when i easily found my way to a lonely and as lovely a retreat certainly as ever sheltered the infirmities of age or the sorrows of youth fast by the green margin of the noble ora and embowered among the fading foliage of his birches stood the little rustic shieling for which that gentle child of misfortune had left the hall of her fa therm the hill rose precipitous behind clothed to the loftiest crag with copses wood from the midst of which here and there the red gigantic trunks of the native pine towered upwards waith their broad sable canopies the wide stream rolling in heavy murmurs close under neath the branches of the trees its dark brown waters gleaming with the gold of the sunset appeared to cut off the wilders ness it embellished from every intrusion of the world asmllu skiff lay chained to the bankand slowly did i urge it with my single strength against the deep and steady flow of the autumnal river from without the appearance of the cottage itself was rude and even desolate but within the habits of another life had already in the course of but a few days begun their triumph i had to stoop ere i could pass the threshold and i trod upon a floor of naked earth but the exquisite cleanliness that had entered with the new inhabitants had of itself robbed poverty of all its meoness every thing upon the walls shone bright in the blaze of the nicelytrimmed wood fire and mammy sat in her elbowchair at the side of it a perfect specimen of the nmajestic repose of extreme but unbend ing age it seemed to me that there was something far more grand about the whole appearance of the old woman now that i saw her under her own paternal roof the bluntness of address and expression which had before been a sort of oddity to amuse a circle of tolerant superiors was now the natural privilege of indepen dence though indeed i am not sure that the sense of home and the instinct of hospitality had not somewhat softened already the external manifestations of a temper which no change of circumstan ces could have essentially altered i was received with courtesyeven with grace and when a minute or two afterwards miss joanne came into the room and modestly saluting me drew her stool towards m1ammys knee i really could not help thinking that in spite of all the young ladys native elegance of aspect and carriage a stranger might easily have been deceived and supposed himself to be contemplating a family group i you will have no great difficulty in believing could not contemplate it with out some feelings of awkwardness as well as of admiration the situation in which i saw joanne bar was new and her demeanour i could not help thinking was almost as greatly changed we had been used to treat each other like friends some spell seemed now to hover over us both our eyes seldom met and neither addressed more than a few syllables to the othershe took her work and i sat listening or pretending to listen to mammy at last i contrived to make it be understood that i had come to take my farewell that i was to leave the country the next morning mammy gave me her blessing very affectionately and i bowed to joanne the poor girl said nothing but in a very low whisper it was  i wish you well sir wherever you go she did not put out her hand and i retired stammering more good byes i jumped into my little boat and had pushed myself a few yards from the brink when i heard my name called in joannes sweet voice and perceived that she had followed me to the bank of the river and was holding something towards me in her hand i ran theskifin again and shc tooped to give me my gloves which i had le behind me our hands touch ed each otherand in the deepening twilight and in the midst of some con fusion of my own i could not be blind to the blush the deep grave timid blush and the troubled workings of that half averted eye how much may pass in a moment my little boat was out in the stream again almost instantly and yet the words return and hope had been whispered and while in rowing acros the river my eyes were fixed upon the lowly cabin i perceived that a shadow was still lingering in the windowand a soft dream floated over my heart that some day i should indeed return and that the world after all might still re tain some visions of hopeay of tender ness and soothing consolation for me even for me no fiery pulse beatno maddening ecstasy or passion fluttered in my brain these were strings which had been snapt but a calm pensive feeling was deep upon me i cannot explain it no man loves twice perhaps in the same sense of the word but although the pinetree will never sprout again after he has been levelled to the ground what need hinder plants of humbler statute yet of softer foliage to spring from the soil beneath which his ponderous roots are mouldering joanne and wald are marriedand great changes follow wald re covers evidence that the connexion between sir claud and the mother of joanne had been such as would according to the law of scotland amount to a regular marriage and that his wife was consequently the heiress of his estatesand the fa mily of sir claud are glad to com promise the matter by ceding to him the property of barrmains his hap piness is qualified however by a strong metlodistical feeling to which the gentle mind of joanne had been for some time yielding and to di vert her attention from those gloomy imaginations which had been created by the preaching of some country fanatic and fostered by solitude he gets into parliament and prepares for a visit to london we pass over a good deal of a comic cast which is fairly executed but exceedingly inferior to the deeper parts of the book to which we now approach with rapidity wald receives the unexpected intelligence that katharine had been deserted by her husband and had disappeared and by one of those strange accidents which never occur anywhere but in novels and not in the best of thee either the lodginghouse of

broken to harness a story of english domestic 81 life new novels by edmund yates 3 vols maxwell co to the readers of the magazine edited by mr edmund yates and to his fellowworkers in literature there is no need to say that  broken to harness resembles its author in being strong manly and good at heart it ia a first novel and a better work of fiction has not for many a week come under om notice from beginning to end we have read it with lively interest and we lay it aside with an agreeable sense of refreshment and increased strength readers of every class will find in the story a liberal fund of amusement and there are those who on closing the third volume will thank the author for certain wise lessons and many tine pictures taken as a whole it is a mons novel dealing far more with bohemia clubrooms and masculine absurdities than with though refinements and graces of womans life but though it ia a  mans novel women will relish it  for throughout its diverse scenes there is a chivalric and unobtrusive recognition of feminine goodness moreover there is not even in its revelations of bohemia a single line that will raise a blush or jar upon the sensitive ear  broken to harness to what object does the title apply 1 a colt long in leg and big in bone ignorant of the collar and fresh from the marsh now for the first time put in training for roadwork  a luckless hunter that having come to grief in a steeplechase has fallen in mans esteem and is condemned henceforth to draw the van instead of following the hounds  a steed of purest pedigree but by reason of some defect from which stainless descent cannot insure immunity deemed unfit to contend for though honours of the turf a highbred dainty filly sentenced after a brief day of triumph in  the row to run between the shafts of a butchers cart or drag the phaeton of a country parson literally to none of these but figuratively to the last young ladies who dance through the season in the best  sets of may fair may shudder at the bare thought of being broken to harness and may scout the possibility that fortune will require them to put their shoulders to domestic wheels and tug away at cumbrous family coaches that stern lot however awaits the greater number of them  and in mr yatess novel they may read how one of their gentle kind and high degree was after much trouble on the part of her trainer and in spite of her skittish ways and high temper put through the manege and broken to harness the poor girl who is subjected to this indignity is barbara lexden penniless niece of a wicked old aunt whose income and place in the world of fashion make up the list of her virtues barbara has been well introduced and ably chaperoned she has made a hit and achieved rank as a reigning helle  and her aunt expects great things of her barbara herself is not disinclined to play the high game indeed she has set her heart on making a grand matchan ambition by no means rare amongst really beautiful young women who stand at one of lifes gamblingtables staking their wit and beauty against the wealth and rank of richer competitors  offers she had had in plentyyouthful peers with slender incomes middleaged commoners solemn wealthy dull    but barbara refused them all she told her aunt that she was playing for a high stake but instead of playing the game out barbara like many girls who would be selfish and worldly if their better natures would permit them ceases to care about the high stake and turns away from the green cloth with a modest prize instead of marrying a rich peer she becomes the wife of frank churchill a journalist on the staff of a daily newspaper who has no connexion whatever with the world in which barbara is accustomed to move franks father was an unsuccessful artist in poverty frank picked up his education at a country school and a german university  and when he falls in love with barbara he is living with his old mother in great adullam street which as scarcely anybody knows is a street lying between grays inn gardeas and mecklenburg square indeed barbara and frank churchill are separated by so wide a bar of social circumstances that mr yates feels it necessary to explain with much care how it was that they were guests in the same country house such a coincidence of highborn beauty and obscure toil is by no means usual but the author accounts for it satisfactorily and manages his story so well that when barbara throws her grand wicked old aunt over and in spite of protests and expostulations becomes the wife of a poor journalist readers do not feel that she is acting otherwise than naturally and in accordance with everyday experience after the wedding comes the honeymoon after that the flood of tears and regrets it is a gloomy hour for barbara when she makes her first entrance into frank churchills house in great adullam street from which humble unattractive dingy dwelling franks mother has retreated in order that the bride may feel herself mistress of her own house she is in harness  but though she begins to work with a good will her pride rebels and the weariness of her days whilst her husband is working away from home is too much for her powers of endurance of course the distance between grays inn road and park lane cuts her off from her old friends  and she is offended by such society as frank can procure for her the pipesmoking artists jealous authors and noisy bohemians who spend their evenings in his study are not persons to her taste  and she is even less pleased by their illdressed wives and chattering daughters other sources of trouble arise barbara and franks mother pull against each other  and through the malice and idleness of lookerson mutual jealousy springs up between husband and wife at last after many outbreaks of temper on the part of barbara and after a trifling display of injustice and violence on franks part the younga wife flies from great adullam street and seeks shelter in the house of a married lady how she is brought to repent this hasty step  how frank learns to judge her more leniently  how grief and the prickings of conscience bring her humbly to his side  how he acknowledging his own misconduct whilst he pardons hers takes her again to his arms  and how she is at last  broken to harness and runs merrily on thinking herself lucky in having fallen into the hands of a skilful and merciful trainerare matters about which the reader must learn from mr yates himself the ending of the tale does not quite please us frank churchill ought not to have obtained that legacy and commissionership in the tintax office  the fitness of things requires that he should by hard work in his own profession have raised himself to prosperity and power and barbara as mistress of a house in russell square ought to have made the discovery that life in mesopotamia may be and in many cases is quite as happy and gracious and refined as lifo in belgravia but our disappointment in this respect does not make us unjust to mr yates an historian must be truthful and as barbaras husband became a great man and a rich one in official circles and as she saw fit to live in a pretty villa on the banks of the thames what can mr yates do but state that such was the case apart from barbaras troubles the story contains much good matter the sketches of the clublife of authors and artists are capital enough has been said of mr yatess cleverness and power  but we have scarcely done justice to the unaffected amiability and manliness  that are amongst his most agreeable qualities,englishfiction

stripping it as he goes of a little of its romance in the novel rob was all daring and resolve with a spice of generosity in his composition though that rather the effiect of calculated contempt than of the pure impulses of nature and a man who plundered by wholesale and was lavish on the same scale in the story he shows more of the peddling roguebhe dilutes his audacity with a dash of discretionhe is shirking in danger and bullying out of it the prefice one of considerable length embraces the story of the outlawed clan of the gregors the oppressions they suffered and the revenges they took covering large tracts on the highland borders the counties of argyle and perth as the gregors did their neighbours the earls of argyle and breadalbane by their influence with the crown fgot these lands entered in their own charters and took forcible possession as opportunitifs occurred these encroach menta of course the gregors resisted and the resistance was by their powerful enemies replvaented at court as acts of invasion and robbery mary and her son james alike legislated against them in the dracospirit of the times and finally forbade the use of the very name and assembling together of more than four at a time mingling rather than merging in the neighbouring clans they in consequence became drummonds buchan ans campbells c in name but continued gregors still in heart and still unitable for clan purposes in the civil wars they in commonswith other higihanders why should they fight with each other when the war opened lowlanders to plunder they adopted the royal cause and at the restoration had influence enough to get the iniquitous statutes against them repealed but not enough to keep them so their reenactment was speedily smuggled in again but the enemies of the

explanatory introduction is occupied not now in communicating any details as to the origin of the 1 abbot or its object or again in ob viating and defending as was the case with the  monastery but with a statement or suggestion of the motives which on its first appearance prompted a speedier publication than usual the monastery and the abbot were but parts of one subject and of course less time was spent in search of a new story but the authorconsidering the monastery in some respects as a failure though he had no serious alarms of any fatal or permanent effects upon his po pularity thought it good policy to hasten t6 fetch up his leeway not to advance was in some sort to recede and he felt it to be of some importance still to show by a fresh and more successful effort that the failure was rather the effect of an illchosen subject than an illmanaged story he was not as he says in his own happy way one of those like fashionable publishers by the way who are willing to suppose the

  tomorrow  by victoria cross walter scott publishing company this novel comes to us marked third edition from which we must assume that the public demand for it has been considerable it is not easy to discover why perhaps it is the air of spurious philosophy and the specious assumption of a knowledge of the world perhaps it is the concentration of the author upon a single passion there is nothing in  tomorrow  to excuse or explain the popularity of the book a young man of a most selfcentred and displeasing type fails to publish his books in england because he is too frank but he knows he is a genius  what need to tell me i possessed a power that inflamed every vein that heated all the blood in my system that filled though they seemed buoyant every cell of my brain  as much need as to tell the expectant mother she has a life within her own but paris is more broadminded and to paris he goes the story is occupied mainly with his relations with his friend howard a poet and his loveaffair with his cousin as to the former howard burns his manuscript and kills his dog as to the latter lucia dies on her weddingday of  that last year of virgin purity of life that had broken her strength to bear the book is on this level throughout it is an example of sheer hysteria and possibly hysteria may be taken by the ignorant and innocent for passion they may be assured however that it is nothing of the sort this story has no kind of claim to consideration as a reflection from life even its absurdities are not amusing,englishfiction

  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival,englishfiction

the vision splendid bv d k broster and g w taxlor v nmurray with this novel the authors of  chantemerle thrust some little wav home their claim to the consideration of the reading public  the vision splendid  resembles its preducessor in at least two respects it is an historical story anid it is very long perhaps it is not too long for it is a xerv full book and there is a great deal of stuff in it l but it methods are leisurely and considered the auth4orb seein to have made up their minds to get the utmo1st out of every situation and they leave little to the readers imagination but that is the worst fault of miss broster and mfiss taylor whose second novel is a careful and genuincely effective piece of work it is supremely to their credit that they have had the courage to place their strv in a period which is as yet hardly sufficiently remnote to seem more than quaint to the average reader yet they have invested it with romance and a sort of glamlloroti realism that do much towards making their book impressive the story is largelybut not primarily on if the beginnings of the oxford lmovement with keble n ewmian isaac williams and the rest of them figuring in its pages but the plot proper centres almost entirely areuinnl the gracious figure of lforatia grenville the daughter f at ountry parson of the old school who marries a french counit mtl leads an unhappy life in paris anyhow the autlirs have given us a very complete and quite sufficiently varied pit ture of life in the english provinces and in paris at the beginning of the last century and we have no hesitation in giving it as our opinion that  the vision splendlild is a very sound piece of work indeed  the vision splendid by florence bright and robert mach kay the vision splendid is the stage and to jean murray a young girl who has just lost her father it appeals with overwhelming power this novel is occupied with her adventures as an actress and is a careful study of stageufe from the point of view of a beginner there is this passage about fleetstreet and the strand in which the press the law and the stage have their centres  the first excites and then gratifies pubuc curiosity4 an intelugent interest in the affairs of the world the newspapers call it laughing in their sleeves the while in the second men pick each others brains to enable them to pick other peoples pockets and to prevent anyone else from doing so the third provides a house of refuge from the garruuty of the one and a place of escape from the bickerings of the other and ministers to the amusement of everybody hutchinson  co gs  the vision splendid by florence bright and robert machray hutchinson  co tins is no better than an ordinary specimen of the modern romance of the stage it has at least one singularly repulsive element in it the actormanager living with the leading woman of his theatre incurs her jealousy for encouraging an ingenue who turns out to be the  leading ladys daughter the mother endeavours to bring about her daughters fall in order to separate the actormanager from the latest object of his affections it is difficult to overcome the feeling of disgust which this situation suggests on the other hand every effort is made by the writers to lessen the disagreeable elements of the situation the details of the dramatic profession of today in london are evidently familiar to the joint authors and many of the scenes are described with skill and success but we cannot speak with equal enthusiasm of the melodramatic catastrophe at the end of the story the book might well make the stagestruck miss hesitate in the choice of her profession,englishfiction
the shadow of ashlydyat by mrs henry wood 3 vols bentleywe consider the shadow of ashlydyat to be the best novel that mrs wood has written it has not the romantic and painful interest of  east lynne but it is a better constructed story and for  steadily accumulating interest where the reader is made to feel every character and incident real and true as if it had come under his personal knowledge we do not know a novel of the present day to be compared with it the power to draw minutely and carefully each character with characteristic individuality in word and action is mrs woods especial gift this endows her pages with a vitality which carries the reader to the end and leaves him with the feeling that the veil which in real life separates man from man has been raised and that he has for once seen and known certain people as intimately as if he had been their guardian angel thisisa great fascination it is not produced by means of metaphysical analysis or philosophical insight mrs wood rarely ventures on a general observation and never goes into metaphysics but she steadily minds her business tells her story carefully and completely and works out her characters with an instinctive knowledge of what they would say and do under the given circumstances which is never at fault her writing resembles good french acting for the skill and care she bestows upon her details without giving them undue prominence at first the number of characters in ashlydyat and the variety of interests introduced may seem likely to prove perplexing but every personage and every incident is so carefully drawn and the threads of the story are kept so distinct that the reader is never oppressed or confusedthe web of conflicting interests is skilfully woven the readers entertainment is well cared for and never flags throughout the story the story concerns the fortunes of the godolphin family who live and have lived for many generations in a stately old house called ashlydyat which with its lands was formerly church property there is a tradition that so long as the godolphins remain in ashlydyat they will be prosperous but if they quit it their ruin will follow also there is a strange unaccountable phenomenon which appears whenever misfortune or death is approachinga shadow which has the aspect of a bier with coffin and mourners in the midst of a graveyard full of tombstones  and this shadow comes over a bare uncultivated portion of land where there is nothing to throw a shadow or t account for the strange appearance this shadow recurs in the story like the refrain of an old ballad and mrs wood assures the reader that this appearance is not her own invention but that the  shadow as well as the chief portions of the story are true of course very few of the people most concerned believe in the superstition  amongst the rest lady godolphin sir georges second wife is the most obstinate of the sceptics she hates the sombre stately old place and insists upon building a pleasant villa at a little distance contriving to take her husband away to live in it when finished this seems to be the first step towards the declension of the family fortune s  but the old prophecy is so skilfully blended with the practical results of individual conduct that it has the effect of an old greek fate unless wc were to write out the whole book we could not give an account of the story there are so many characters each following his own devices yet so linked together by circumstances that a bald outline of the tale would convey no idea of the book sir george godolphin has been at the head of a longestablished bankone of those old county banks in which the surrounding country believes far more devoutly than in the bank of england after sir georges death the younger son being a full partner gets into the hands of verrall the moneylender a cleverly indicated character by his means and the blandishments of a questionable young lady miss charlotte pain young godolphin is led on to ruin and to crime this sounds common place enough but it is in the working out of this main fact and in the variety of incidents involved that the strength and charm of the story lie we think that mrs wood has dealt too leniently with the gay and gallant george godolphin whose sins bring so mach woe upon innocent people but even the female reader will be constrained to forgive miss charlotte pain unprincipled as she is for the sake of her thorough goodnature thomas godolphin is a noble character the episode of ethel grame the girl to whom he is engaged is skilfully managed maria the wife of george godolphin is sure of the readers sympathy she is a sweet and perfect wifetoo perfect for if she had expressed her own good sense with more emphasis it would have been better though not so pleasant for the erring mr george in all the details of the personal and private troubles which follow the great catastrophe of the bank mrs wood has shown skill but it must not be supposed that the shadow of ashlydyat is an oppressive bookthe readers interest is never sacrificed and it is a book that he may return to with pleasure  thie shadow of ashilydyatt ix most

fiction mir alemeres elopement by charles marriott nash 6s in reflecting upon this talethe maturest the most masterful and perhaps the most significant that mr charles marriott has yet writtenone is almost irresistibly attracted to the question of the relative potential effects of i energy and 2 mass upon the momentum and the staying power of a novel in handling this themewhich deals with the effect upon her own and a few other lives of t wifes rebellion and desertion of her husbandmr marriott is lavish of energy devoting it to a resolute concentration upon the matter in hand to the exclusion of almost everything else and bringing his tale to a conclusion sufficiently complete in some three hundred octavo pages of fairly large print that is to say it occupies about half the space of mr henry james  the golden bowl a book the very mention of which almost provokes a study in contrasts in how leisurely a manner does the prince in that tale saunter on to the stage that is unobtrusively but carefully prepared for him how deliberately he stops before a bond street window strolls on again eventually pays a cali all the time it is true the author is revealing him letting him reveal himself turning light upon a facet here and there but all so quietly with such an air almost of abstraction that though you cannot miss the fact that you are in the very midst of the stress of life you may easily miss the perception of the moments which are dominating great issues in comparison with all this the sudden appearance in mr marriotts opening page of sherring and umney before the door of 29 sidney gardens in hot pursuit of dick feddon has almost the effect of the entry of puppets so vigorously do they proceed to take up their allotted parts and discover their characteristics not that mr marriotts writing is really spasmodic or even hurried if his puppets are highly geared they are thoroughly well oiled he merely has them trained to the highest degree of efficiency they gallop as it were like horse artillery fully equipped into action each character bringing his motives views of life and estimate of the situation to bear upon the tale at long or short range as the case may be tnere is no doubt that at first such a method carries all before it the rapid introduction to a succession of active intellects all busily employed stimulates the reader and rivets his attention so that he cares little to discover the showman working the wires though more than a glimpse of himself his wit and his prejudices is to be had for the looking but upon a second perusal when all the plot is known do not all these various clever mental anatomiesstand out a little bare to the view  compare all the colloquies between evelyn alemere sweet light and alluringand the boy she is tricking compare again the sarcastic collofuies between feddons mother and her advisers with all those wonderful interwoven subtly significant conversations in mr james book it will be seen that while the younger writer brings a widening knowledge of life to bear upon his story the elder allows his story to flow broadly through a wide knowledge of life and so brings his readers before broad and spacious horizons to the contemplation of which they may return again and again it would of course be as absurd to criticise mr marriott for what he does not attempt to do as to suggest that any long novel is likely to be better than any short one moreover we cordially admire such choice effective brevity as that which can so movingly put the whole tragedy of archdales life upon a single page yet we think that if a man have the stuff in him  mass  makes for permanence and we believe too that were mr marriott to give himself more room he would lose a certain occasional air of halfveiled rancour towards his meaner personages which is not the most admirable of many admirable qualities  mrs alemeres elopement by charles marriott jnashj mr marriott has gone far in  mrs alemeres elopement towards the fulfilment of the high expectations raised by his former novels his style is less laboured his manner of narration stronger his touch in characterdrawing more sure what is not so welcome is the cynicism that pervades the book evelyn alemere beautiful refined and passionate leaves her husbands roof with richard feddon a young musician with something of the knightly temperament who is as certain of her purity as her loveliness there is nothing in their relations to disturb his idealistic admiration of her but she induces him to allow the divorce proceedings brought by her husband to go undefended and secretly marries a former lover immediately she is free mrs alemere is a very clever and interesting study though here and there it is somewhat marred by a lack of consistency that this sirenlike creature should be treated in a cynical mood is not unnatural but unfortunately there is scarcely one character in the book that is drawn sympathetically mrs feddon who looks with haughty disapproval upon the escapades of her quixotic son is made to cut an undignified figure in a particularly cruel scene and rose archdale the only woman in the story who has escaped the contempt of the author is rather too cold and reserved to be really attractive mr marriotts male creations do not fare much better at his hands than do the women they are nearly all foolish meddlesome and vain,englishfiction

ftebttwo the tenant of wildffll ha ll by acton  bull 3 vols london t c newby it would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled we must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis wiinporte mrs graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one gilbert markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood mr gilbert markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this direction  can i find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that i want at home  and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  there was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon i walked back to get a better view of it when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchen make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the

novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor the religiomin seltiments wvhich the authoress puts

held in bondage or granville de vigne by uiuda tinsley brothers onida describes vividly and possesses no small power of combination and the appearance of  held in bondage might have been hailed with satisfaction had it not been disfigured by errors of judgment like many novels of the day  held in bondage offers us two heroes not as often happens a good one to enlist our sympathy and a bad one to merit our contempt but two parallel specimens of brilliant and chivalrous humanity rich generous intellectual and universally beloved the fiery de vigne and the gentle sabretasche are put forth as samples of englands best and noblest and while sneering gratuitously at  eminent christians ouida would havo us believe that honourable feeling and true goodness find fitting representatives in the gallant officers whose adventures he describes de vigne at the age of twentysix falk madly in love with a young and haughty beauty miss trefusis and their courtship is carried on seton les formes till in due course it becomes clear that it is to end in matrimony during the early stages of their acquaintance the piercing glances of  the trefusis remind de vigne of lucy davis a young milliner whom he had known some years before his friends too jocularly allude to the likeness but no one suspects the truth until after the churoh has performed its solemn function the bride coolly signs herself  lucy trefusisor davis de vigne flings her from him in furious anger rushes wildly from the vestry and immediately exchanges for india after an interval of several years de vigne returns to england still under the middle age and strikingly handsome and attractive but a cynical and womanhating man in the mean time little alma tressilianthe supposed granddaughter of an old and valued friend has grown into womanhood and is gaining her subsistence as an artist de vigne meets her and a warm friendship grows up between them which speedily ripens into love after a few silent struggles with his feelings he gives way entirely to ms passion and married man as he is resolves to ask her to brave the scorn of the world and fly with him to some foreign clime at this crisis lord vane castleton a rather coarser villain than himself carries off alma by stratagem and de vigne sails instantly for the crimea furious at almas supposed desertion of him and despising the saur and fickle sex more heartily than ever in the mean time alma escapes from her captor and finds an asylum with lady violet daughter of lord molyneux agirl aa young lovely ana inno oent as herself to this young lady sabretasche who is also a married man becomes deeply attached and he so far partakes of the de vigne nature that he calmly watches the growth ofner pure affection without enlightening her as to bis real position sabretasche like de vigne is a crimean hero and we may here observe that these officers display all the manly activity that can possibly be desired whether they are called upon to take part in a cavalry charge or to pitch an offending nobleman down a flight of stairs in course of time our two heroes return from the crimea and hasten to paris where alma and violet are residing de vigne by this time has become aware of almas innocence and fidelity and his passion returns with double force he meets her five minutes after again seeing  the trefusis and confesses himself a married man but is not withheld either by respect for her or regard for his deceased friend from exacting the vows of unalterable affection which she is unhappily too willing to give sabretasche it must be confessed does not go so far as this but then violet is an earls daughter and alma only a poor artist which of course makes all the difference it requires no very complicated stage artifice to get rid of the inconvenient wives and when this is done the two love affairs are very happily adjusted we offer our thanks to ouicla for not condemning violet to die of a broken heart or alma to become the companion for life of a man ho is wedded to another but we have no sympathy with middleaged men who with lofty words of honour on their lips and a wealth of virtuous indignation at their disposal scruple not to steal the affections of inexperienced girls who are young enough to be their own daughters to us de vigne and sabretasche who instil slow poison and are capable of a lifelong deception do not appear much better than lord vane castleton and to what does all this tend  simply to the moral that early unions are dangerous and that marriage with an unpleasant woman ought to be easily dissolved household cares small troubles debts and taxgatherers are sad torments to young and struggling couples and therefore we are asked to pity the sorrows of an inexperienced stripling of twentysix who enters upon married life with an unincumbered rentroll of 20000 ayear,englishfiction

the legends of smokeover principal jacks is better known to most of us as editor of the hibbert journal than as presiding over manchester college oxford or again as the author of a volume called  the alchemy of thought  than as the biographer of stopford brooke he has written stories beforewitness  philosophers in trouble and in and out of them has given specimens of ability as a man of wit and satire in his quarterly review we meet with him more especially as one who is versed deeply in the deeper thought of the day the present volume is at once characteristic and unexpectedcharacteristic because it has something of all the qualities just intimated and is original in its own way as he is always but unexpected also because it is like nothing that he has done previously it is in any case a book which will set its readers thinking in several vital directions if they are capable of anything that it is worth while calling thought it is not what ordinarily people would call religious and yet it makes for righteousness for one grows better in the reading as if the value of things that matter had risen suddenly in our esteem and the false values had come down to their proper level of nil smokeover is  a city much like london as shelley said once of another place which it would be invidious to mention in the present connection in a sense its legends belong to a world philosophised its economics to faerie its dramatis personae to a realm not realised where daily life is exercised normally in heroics but in a second sense which is perhaps truer the place is just like this one the people are just like some of us but a little lifted up in a motive light of otherwhere it should be said that smokeover is a state a presiding spirit rather than a place and it happens that its legends are those of rebels who are on strike for a kingdom  not founded on smoke it comes about therefore that all its personalities are types written over with eloquent meanings from head to foot and all its events are omens yet it is in the sense that we also are types full of messages for those who can read and our every event is a portent the fact that the book claims to be one of legends the divisions of which are marked plainly by italicised paragraphs after the manner of interludes does not prevent it from being an ordered story in continuity from beginning to end and the fact that it is a parable  with child of great intent does not prevent it from being as much like a novel as such a thing can well be very living too in the telling it begins in smokeover and ends on the verge of utopia amidst largess of poetical justice for those who concern the reader it is arabian nights if you like or a scheme of universal reconstruction of a very practical kind which is perhaps the same thing if it is not a guide to the perplexed like that of maimonides principal jacks is to be congratulated on a brilliant book which can be approached and appreciated from several angles including paradoxical philosophy a e w   the legends of smokeover by l p jacks us 6i hodder  stoughton,englishfiction
love and honour by m e carr a first novel by a new writer with this motto on the titlepage from boswells life of johnson   you know courage is reckoned the greatest of all virtues because unless a man has that virtue he has no security for preserving any other the leading theme of the story is the conflict between love and honour in the mind of one of the characters a colonel ia the prussian army the opening chapter is laid in westphalia smith elder 6s  love and honour by m e carr smith elder 6s this dignified and respectable but rather pedestrian novel by a new writer deals with military society in westphalia just after the elevation of jerome to the westphalian throne heinz von ostenburg the peerless hero is described in a passage which in its careful conventionality is typical of the whole book  ostenburg took the vacant seat at duclos side in some inexplicable way the company brilliant as it was had shrunk into insignificance since his entrance    the grey eyes were st deeply under thick brows the nose was straight with finelycut nostrils the chin well moulded the mouth curled scornfully and hoed at the corners there were lines too about the eyes and the whole expression in repose was rather disdainful though sometimes as now a rarely brilliant suile lit it almost to beauty but even smiling the face was hard to read and one grew curious to know what lay behind it it will be perceived that ostenburg belongs to a wellknown species he had loved a french girl whom he supposes to have been guillotined in the terror but needless to say anais arrives duly in cassel as the wife of a fighting husband mutual recognition follows the lady virtuously repulses but is conquered the husband recks not of his dishonour till the moment when his wife dying in the retreat from moscow breathes with her pale lips the name  heinz then there is a duel and heinz as he thinks kills the husband it is a little characteristic of the author that she cannot finish the plot without committing the husband to a false death from which he rises again to the detriment of the hero  love and honour new novels by m e carr smith elder  co the period chosen for the setting of this romantic tale is that of napoleons wars and has evidently been carefully studied ostenburgs defection from the prussian army to serve the king of westphalia and ultimately the emperor himself is one and the most important of the links in a long chain of moral cowardice which finally leads to his ruin and which must be set down to the account of a woman the author points his or more probably her moral with great insistency no pains are spared to paint ithe count in the most brilliant and attractive colours though from the beginning we are permitted to perceive the weak spot in his character his prolonged punishment and the suffering entailed are depicted in an equally lavish manner there are certainly extenuating circumstances in his passion for madame duclos but his pursuit of it is long drawn out and tedious the contrast of her french wit and charm with the seriousminded illdressed german women is a happy touch and there is a good atmosphere of german sentiment throughout the book all that concerns jeromes brief aeign at the westphalian court is brightly written later the account of the retreat from moscow madame ducloss death and orenburgs degradation is rather too painful but redeemed by the consistent loyalty and wholesomeness of veronika von pustau and her husband the author has yet to learn concentration and lightness of touch but the work is decidedly conscientious,englishfiction
i olv blaki gd work a novel john lady   0  ly jeaffreeon auther of i a book about dotos thni volumes chapman and hall decidedly this is one of the best novels of the season its defect which is mall arises from overimitation of mr wilkie collins the story is told in the narratives of three people like that of i the woman in whit and the solemn injunction of one diarist julian gower that tabitha tree for whom it is written shall not alter a word imitates too closely one of the weak points of the adopted model also for the sake of increasing interest olive blake while about her good work is made to perplex and grieve the excellent tabitha with mysteries that lead to less than nothing and that she can only explain by saying that it gave her pleasure to torment her friend seeing how nobly she bore torture and how faithful she was to her own heart in spite of every doubt thrust painfully upon it mystery so made is not legitimately made but in good truth mr jeaifreson is not dependent upon story for the success of his novel and if it were far more faulty in construction than we think it to be the book would be read with pleasure the most noticeable fact is that the inevitable defects of a tale told by triple autobiography are so far overcome that a man being the author of the book and two of the supposed autobiographers women they do absolutely write like women nice discrimination of character expressed naturallyit is easy enough to express artificiallythrough style would be too much to expect but mr jeaffreson sufficiently distinguishes between the two journalsone that of the active and brave olive blake vigorous in her i good work b7 labouring for years with fearless determination spending all her means to right a wronged woman though success proves her own marriage null the other that of tabitha tree whose womans life of disappointed love takes vengeance on the world only in smiling selfdenial and unobtrusive beneficence it is much that in the journals of these persons the sense of beauty in detail the minute notice of character the love of nature the merciful construction of evil and the faith iin god and in all goodness by which women make life beautiful has been preserved the book ts in direct con1 treat to that novel of mr salas of which we have lately spoken it is running over with the milk of human kindness which that writer accounts it clever to reject as lait ddnene used only by the sickly there is in tris stoyo olire blakes good work no trace of sickliness the faith in life is though expressed through the persons of women as manly as it is generous mr jeaffreson instead of proving that the men who please us are all knaves at heart pleasantly disappoints us here and there by showing us an honest kindly man where the experience of novel readers would lead them to see preparation for an act of villany solomon easys lawyer is an example of this and the good clergyman of the old school himself with  the corn  country  in which he lives the harvest felds he vists the lanes through which he drives ia his gig and his household with the two girls in whom the story cetre is a sketch more after the manner of the vicar of waked than of the woman in lihije we took up mr jeufreoms novel hardly expecting to be pleased for his book about doctors was unsatisfactory but the first chapters of olive blake at once proved that he has in him the right spirit of an artist and the wholo work convinces us that good as this novel is better will follow it unless the taste of the day lead its author astray into a de3ire for the couotiou of sensation  plots  olive blakes good work  a novel by john cordy jeaffreson 3 vols chapman  hall in olive blakes good work mr jeaffreson has made a great advance upon his former novels good as they were the story told is an extremely interesting one a story that will certainly be read through and in some parts more than once by any one who begins it the plan does not reveal itself to the guesses of the sagacious reader until he conies face to face with the solution at the authors own appointed time the reader will also feel compelled to attend to his own duty towards the book  to read it steadily as he reads a living man whom he needs to understand not to advance his knowledge by skipping intermediate steps under the penalty of spoiling his own delight in the authors labours the author docs his duty not only by providing a very interesting story but by telling it remarkably well there is and always will be a fascination in stories of circumstantial evidence there is the hunting instiuct roused to track a fact through all the doublings and windings of concealment a reader loves to assist at the unravelling of a plot or the detection of evidence for himself and not to have it flashed out to him in halfa dozen sentences of explanation in the last chapter where the characters are grouping for the final tableau of happiness and poetical justice previous to the fall of the curtain mr jeatfreson has selected the method inaugurated by mr wilkie collins in his  woman in white the main actors in the drama narrate their own immediate share of the business aud speak ol nothing but what they individually know and feel by this means the reader is kept from seeing too far before him the first part of the story is laid in suffolk in the corn countya district mr jeatfreson knows well and describes with the affection of one who is proud of belonging to the shires the pictures of the old rectory and the kuy quiet fertile country which seems always basking in the sun are charming the rev solomon easy in his canonicals silk stockings and stately silverbuckled shoes examining the villageboys according to the dtclaraticnes of the statutes of the benefaction is a picture from the life the old rectors drives in the ponyphaeton through the lanes and fields to see the crops and his mild childlike complacency at being told he can drive a bargain are all so natural that the reader finds himself asking the childs question is it all true  it is not till the middle of the second volume that he begins to suspect that he is in for a tale with a plot in it the early life of the two sisters in tue quiet rectory the motherly elder sister and her young charge julian gower with his brotherly love all naturally prepare the reader for what comes that the elder sister loves him with the love of a woman and does not discern that to him she is only a great comfort instead of a great hope the painful awakening that her childsister and not herself has won the prize and the loyalty with which she contends against her own disappointment keeping from all reaction of injustice and bitterness are made very touching aud very true mr jeafvreson shows his knowledge of women by a manly aud delicate reverence for them for which women will thank him which shows a far deeper insight than the supercilious display of some writers and some moralists who profes to think that dissimulation and inbred fa lshood rre the badge of all their tribe one of the very best passages in his book is where he goes rather out of his way to pay his own homage to give his owu testimony to their deive to be true und to do the thing that is riht the way in which the older sister bears her disappointment is very skilfully managed th readers sympathy never borders on contempt although we do not think that mr jeaitreson need have protested so energetically aboat her crimson blushes there was no cause for shaine or any sense of humiliation  she was mistaken but she had been misled by circumstances likely to have misled any one and she took up the penalty so bravely that the reader respects her as if she hod won instead of lost in the second volume the mystery of the book begius etty the young sister betrothed to julian linds out that she does not care for him lie is absent pushing his fortune abroad to enable him to keep a wife the grandfather had died some time previously leaving them in thc position whicn obliged them to earn their own living etty disgusted at schoolkeeping discontented with thc prospect of her long engagement elopes leaving no clue behind her except that sho is gone away with a military man elderly ugly taciturn whom nobody had ever suspected of being aware of her existence beyond though most distantly polite recognition the elder sister in the shanie and sorrow of the discovery abruptly leaves the cottage where they had lived since their graudfathers death and goes no one knows where to hide herself from all who ever knew her from this part the mystery becomes highly complex olive blake who has only once appeared before becomes ono of the actors  she marries according to a family compact the friend of though mau with whom etty left her home an excellent man of mature age she tells her own part of the storyhow after she had been a few months married she has a strange visitor a young and beautiful lady who declares that she is married to her husband now arthur petersham was the most unlikely mau in the world to do anything of the sort the reader never for a moment suspects him the character is well managed the reader is made to understand his powers of influence though he only appears in narrative and never in his own person of course the wife does not believe ettys story the marriage she asserts as having taken place at a certain church is not on the register her story is wildly improbable in all its details when her husband comes back she tells him the incident his explanation is perfectly coherent and satisfactory etty never appears again and olive blake never troubles her head further about her this is treated as her sin and we think morbidly exaggerated by the author olive blake is the least natural of all the characters she is too much ofthe personage so frequently met with in old novels who has a mysterious knowledge of every ones affairs and who interferes in the crisis of everybodys destiny that olive blake should once startle a person whom she had never seen by her shrewd intuition may be accepted but when it occurs several times it becomes a trick of machinery rather than a trait of character after awhile in her sorrow for the loss of her own child she remembers etty and is morbidly haunted by the recollection of her misery aud her own hardheartedness in though midst of this it comes to her knowledge that her husband excellent sensible affectionate as he has seemed to her and to the world hitherto without a flaw on his surface has in one flagrant instance at least and very recently been a profligate under aggravated circumstances and the conviction is present with her that ettys story is true without waiting to mourn over herself or to think of her own position she separates from her husband and resolves to find etty and to do her justice as she had ample cause for her own separation it excites no surprise or question in society and with mystery and secrecy and unrelenting persistence she sets herself to the work of unravelling the iniquity of her husbands wrong towards etty the difficulties are enormous all clue has been so skilfully and carefully destroyed so many years have elapsed that discovery of evidence seems hopeless the reader is made to assist in the search and to pick up and add link to link of the chain meanwhile the fortunes of the elder sister go on she too has hid herself with care from all who ever knew her she has to be found not by the reader for the reader knows all she is doing but by her friends she has to discover as she believes her sisters child to hear from a strange lady who addresses her in the park a story which is half of it true and half of it intended to mislead her into the belief of her sisters death after a life of shame this portion of the novel we object to very much indeedit is a fraud on the purest and noblest feelings of her sisteraudthough entered into with the best of intentions is so cruel so unnecessary that every reader will resent it because olive blake chose to play at providence what right had she to outrage a good and patient and deeplysuffering woman by a story she knew to be false and for the sake of effecting a possible good in an improbable manner  the elder sister deserved better than to be mado a dupe through the whole story olive blake in spite of her good work is detestableher character is not enough worked out to make her strange acts a study of human nature sho remains throughout the machine her conduct to the elder sister after the elaborate plot for bringing her and julian together has succeeded aud we hope she is to be as happy as she deserves is atrociousno other word will suit to try her fine nature to the utmost to see if she can bo unselfish and generous and trust her husband under the extremity of false appearances she goads her with suggestions of diabolical malice and when she has administered her tortuie till her victim faints she allows her to discover that she has been merely trying her olive blake being the mainspring of the book ought to have been made more like a human being or at least to have been developed with more care so that the reader might have accepted her for the sake of increasing his stock of psychological knowledgebut as she stands she is a disagreeable improbability as to etty the victim too much stress is laid on the accident of a legal ceremony it does not in the least lessen her wickedness  it only renders her less unfortunate and gives a reason why arthur petersham should find it worth his while to secrete her in a lunatic asylum after he had abandoned her and married another woman with all faults found aud objections made the reader will not fail to read the story of  olive blakes good work from first to last for the sake of the story and he will return to its pages for the sake of though many noble and excellent sentiments which in the interest of following the story he may not read with the attention they merit mr jeaffreson will yet write a novel far superior to olive blakes good work  he possesses though requisite qualities for telling a story to which there will be no exceptions,englishfiction
the school for fathers an old english storv by t gwynne london smith elder and co cornhill 1852 the tale is admirably told the moral excellent and thc characters are truthfully yet spiritedly drawn the events recorded are supposed to have transpired some century or so ago in the days of powder and swords and the plot is simple and may be conveyed in a few words sir thomas warren a man of pleasure and a courtier having been employed for ten years in a diplomatic capacity abroad returns unexpectedly to england and finding himself from a variety of causes incapable of pursuing the course of life in which he has been hitherto indulging determines to occupy himself in the education of his son whom he has hitherto sadly neglected now his son jack has been residing from his infancy in thc remote corner of a midland county with his uncle squire warren a fine specimen of thc foxhunter of that period in character habits and conversation he reminds us forcibly of old sir roger de coverley aud consequently presents a striking contrast to his foppish and effeminate brother living under bis roof partaking in all his amusements and pursuits jack had become the precise counterpart of his worthy relative at thc epoch when he is introduced to us he is  rising nineteen over six feet in height hale hearty and robust a keen sportsman shy and ungainly in his manners generous and warmhearted but somewhat inclined to obstinacy and in intellect not over bright at the time when his father arrives with the intention of carrying him off to london to educate him  wiore suorum jack finds himself most unpleasantly circumstanced in consequence of an attachment bc had long since formed with the fair daughter of thc vicar lydia freeman a young belle whose bright eyes have inflamed the hearts of more than one admirer fearing an angry refusal in case he should seek his fathers consent to their union he determines to brusque matters and accordingly first obtains the young ladys consent aud then informs his parent to his astonishment sir thomas offers no opposition to the match provided thc weddingday is postponed for a couple of years as he fully anticipates that long ere then an introduction to london life with all its concomitants will have eradicated this  boyish fancy poor jack arrives in london and finds himself suddenly immersed in gaieties for which he has no taste dissipations that he abhors compelled as he is at the same time to forego all his wonted pursuits and to submit to the severest discipline while he is forced te acquire accomplishments that only render him still more awkward in his demeanour and more ludicrous in his appearance sir thomas having resolved that jack should marry a lady of fortune takes much pains to effect his introduction to an eligible individual of that denomination this excites the jealousy of a host of rivals for though jack remains undeviatingly true to his  little lydia he is compelled by bis unreasonable father to make some show of  attention  to the captivating widow fairfax now it so happens that one colonel pcnruddock has already determined to win and wear her like many others of her sex under similar circumstances out of caprice the lady pretends to admire jack greatly though she has secretly predetermined to give her hand to the colonel they meet at an evening party  tins insult colonel penruddocks malignant glance was on him hatred contempt and jealousy gleamed in his eye that very morning mistress fairfax had carelessly saidon pur pose of coursethat she never beheld so fine a man as mr warrenthat be possessed so artless yet so fascinating a mode of paying his addresses she was sure no heart could resist him then she leaned her cheek on her hand looked absent sighed and allowed the colonel to address her twice before she appeared to know that he had done so at all the colonel threw himself into one of his most violent tornadoes and rushed out of the house the widow tapped ber chin approvingly with her fan surveyed her charming face in thc glass laughed hummed an opera tune and went to the auction tiie colonel had not condescended so much as to bow to her on the evening in question when he saw jack proceeding towards her the muscles of his thin face worked nervously he placed himself in the way and as jack approached leaned his hand on though back of a chair and advanced his right foot directly in jacks path jack hurrying  to qct it over perceived not the guardsmans movement isle drew near the colonel contracting every muscle held bis foot firmly planted jack tripped the colonel smiled a ghastly smile had jack been lighter or more active he would have tripped and recovered himself but the poor fellow was neither he tripped stumbled ran two or three paces forward and fell prostrate at the widows feet good manners were totally forgotten and a titter which grew to a laugh salutedjacks misfortune sir thomas swore and fumed jack arose anger and indignation chased shyness and mauvaue honte from his soul everything around bim seemed to whirl and totter he heard the laughter he felt the insult ke strode up to colonel penruddock like a young hercules and in a loud clear voice he shouted  was that on purpose or by accident  on purpose replied the colonel bowing and then drawing himself up to his utmost height  then take that 1 roared jack and doubling his fist he drew it back to his shoulder then straitening bis arm with the iron strength of a gladiator he struck the colonel on though face with the whole might of his thick muscular arm the colonel reeled and fell crushing a chair in his tall au the mun present rushed towards him the laughter was hushed penruddock arose with an oat the blood streaming from his face several ladies fell into  hysteric affections  and faintings but the gentlemen being all occupied round jack and the colonel they soon recovered their senses sir thomas drew his son away from penruddock anger and disgust stamped upon his features this unpleasant incident of course gives rise to a duel which is so admirably described that we cannot refrain from quoting it the duel there had been a slight fall of snow during the night which only partially covered the ground though shrill thin voice of thc sweep and though rolling of a few heavy dust carts were the predominating sounds the air was damp and penetrating the atmosphere murky and dull and beginning to bo charged with the smoke of early fires though shops were unopenedfew passengers abroadhere and there a workman proceeding to his work pipe iu mouth its very cold said lord langley as they walked quickly to the back of montagu house  i wonder if the colonels on the ground  i seo him drawing near said jack  theres the captaiu with him aud another fellowthe surgeon i take it lord langley forced a smile and saidto make our party equal to theirs i begged our family surgeon to be on the ground and there he is  thankee it was very thoughtful of you my love to my father and 1 hope hell accept thc watch i brought from the country in remembrance of mc hang it i forgot his messagehones youll come home to breakfast with us if i come off all right  i shall bc delighted preliminaries were soon settled and though combatants stripping off coat waistcoat and stock crossed their welltempered glittering taper swords  what a lino young fellow your friend i my lord whispered lord langleys surgeon to him  i never saw a liner man dead or alive pity if he falls lord langley sighed and looked sorrowfully at poor jack the regimental surgeon who attended the colonel was equally struck with him egad sir what a grenadier hed make he said to captain richmond  i should ask nothing better than to command a battalion of the same sort was the reply jack and the colonel began their duel under very different feelings jack was determined not to hurt the colonel but merely to parry his thrusts he had no ill will towards him and no feeling for duels the colonel on the other hand felt that he was opposed to a rival and a man who had insulted him and put bim in a ridiculous position beneath the very eyes of his mistress his soul was bitter with hatred und revenge and he swore that cither jack or himself must die that day after a short  bout seeing jacks play he dropped the point of his sword and cried with flashing eyes and angry voice  i will not be treated like a child sir fight fairly and attack me as well as defend yourself jack obeyed and presently his bright sword entered penruddocks right breast fortunately for him the point slipped along one of the ribs instead of penetrating between them and anon though fight was renewed the swords wound about each other like lightningthc clear light clashing peculiar to the small sword only to be rightly explained by the word ucliquetis was the only sound heard jack received a wound in the thick of the arm but acquitted himself very well never lost bis coolness or temper aud gave the colonel a great deal to do still the swords clashed and glittered seconds and surgeons breathless with interest knew not on which of the combatants to pronounce at last penruddock with the expression of a demon parried one of jacks thrustsadvancedlungedthe guard of his sharp sword struck his adversarys nbs in a line with his breast the reddened blade coming out beneath the left arm pic thank the gods muttered the colonel as he drew out his sword and lord langley captain richmond and both surgeons rushed towards poor jack  i dont think its much he said putting his hand to his side  is the colonel satisfied lord langley put his arm around him jacks face grew pale his knees gave way beneath bis weight und bc sank to the earth supporting himself on his hands the surgeons tore away bis shirt the sooner to arrive at his wound they saw at once the course the sword had taken and shook their heads at lord langley  youd better not move him or disturb him my lordit will soon be over whispered the regimental surgeon lord langley kneeling down supported his dying friend and took his hand in bis poor jack feebly pressed it and witi an effort said  will you break it to my uncle and lyddie  god bless you  i will on my honour replied lord langley his eyes filled with tears there was solemn silencea silence that could be felt the surgeons knelt on each side of jack thc colonel and his friend were gone the denouement of this touching history we leave our readers to peruse from the book itself and as we cannot improve upon our authors eloquent language we subjoin the important moral he is desirous of inculcating the moral fathers before you put your sons in any particular path in life study if you can their various dispositions characters talents and capabilities how often do we see men in the army or navy who had they been allowed to follow their true bent would have made excellent churchmen or lawyers and who on their fathers death quit the profession of arms for more genial pursuits again how often do we see a languishing nonchalant clergyman without feeling for his calling perishing with ennui who would have been a distinguished soldier but for the paternal will which said  that boy must go into the church then again we behold a barrister detesting penandink and close hot courts and law study and practicea being whose aspirations and talents all pointed to the sea but his fathers taste pointed to an intellectual profession and the boy without the least love of study or much aptitude for it is dragooned bon gri mal gre to the bar you will see such an one during his vacation living in salt wateryachting steaming rowing voyaging in merchantmen and returning to bis gown and wig with a weary heart 1 do not mean that because a boy has read  robaer crusoe  as young gentlemen are wont to pronounce the name that his enthusiasm is to be gratified by being sent in quest of shipwreck and  man friday any more than that he should be allowed to be a highwayman a character for which some boys have a great penchant because his enthusiasm has been awakened by the life of robin hood or dick turpin but it is a cruel sight to see a mans life passing by in though daily avocations of a profession for which lie bas no feelingperhaps a positive dislikeand to which a fathers will condemned him even before he could walk or talki young gentlemens caprices should not bo studied but their characters and aptitudes are worthy of some little consideration we know not whether this is mr gwynnes first essay at authorship if however such it be we congratulate the reading public upon thc pleasure they may reasonably anticipate from the future productions of his graceful pen and lively fancy he displays not only a cultivated but an observant minda keen appreciation of humour and his descriptive powers are fully upon a par with those of any living writer we hope that the momentous lesson he seeks to impress upon the generation of  fathers  will not have been preached in vain and the volume before us will indeed be a valuable one if it prove the means of averting from a single youth the sad doom of being forced to embrace a profession opposed to all his tastes habits and inclinations  the school for fathers an old englisjt story our library table by t gwynnemr gwynne gives us another taleand not the worst which has been

contains duties no graver and pleasures no sweeter than those belonging to a pinka pair of buckskinsa southerly wind and a cloudy skya jolly dinner when the chase was overand a rosebud looking over the parsons gate in the shape of the parsons pretty daughter when jack grew to mans estate he was claimed by bis fathera precious type of the  father upon town of old comedya being all patches and pouncet box and redheeled shoes who cherished his hands in a muff and his shapely legs in curiously clocked hose sipped scandal over his chocolate held every fine woman to be the lawful prize of every macaronis vanity and considered all homely tastes sincere affections and generous sentiments as so much obsolete nonsense unbecoming a complete gentleman such a father though easily conjured up by any one decently read in congreve and the spectator we nevertheless apprehend had never a real existence as type of a class  seized on by this demon of gentility and false breeding poor jack was compelled up to london in spite of himself  and there handed over to a dancing master a fencing master a french master a tailor who made torturing coats a wigraaker who crowned the youthful and truthful english

the wicked and perverting father too made no secret of his wickedness threw no cloak over evil calling it good but openly professed worldliness as his creed and fashion as his idol and laughed complacently at his belief in his divinity jack obeyedstout in those exaggerated notions of filial submission by which the sons of england are invited to obey no matter what provided the church register and the old family bible invest it with paternal authority to this oledience the countrybred youth fell a martyrbeing shot in a duelthere is force in many of the scenes of this sad but factitious story and mr gwynne is well acquainted with the catchwords and costume of his period but the tale is not agreeable to us simply for the reason above hintedbecause it is untrue as untrue as the son of the soil who figured in the comedies of reynolds and okeeffe and colman producing from beneath his scarlet waistcoat manly sentiments and antipathies to everything french the like of which never grew in any real shire or hundred of england our objection to all classnovels is not lessened by the fact of the classes being laputan or brobdignagianor in short utterly and perversely

japhet in search of a father by the author of  peter sim pie sec we do not mention this work for the sake of uttering one syllable in its praise we feel certain that all other critics will most completely take that trouble off our hands we merely announce its appearance in three orthodox volumes and feel that we shall very shortly have to announce its dispersion all over the reading world not to do thus much would be putting a sort of slight upon our readersto do more we are much more capable than inclined  japhet in search of his father by the author of jacob faithful 3 vols we are acquainted with few novels in our language that has been received with more general approbation than the jacob faithful  of captain marryat the humour the drollery the truth and fidelity of the descriptions the force of outline with which the characters were drawnall pleased in spite of many defects in the formnaof the story the beauties and faults of the present novel however inferior it may be to its predecessor are the same it abounds in spirit liveliness variety of character drollery of adventure and vis cornica throughout to be sure its comedy is always on the borders of farce and as long as effect is produced no matter what it costs the whole is a wondrous web of incongruities and impossibilities such as no picture of human life ever presented scarcely one event is even probable scarcely one character consistent but if the taste of the author is to be called in question in collecting such materials for his edifice his skill and genius must the more be praised for that he has been able to give it if not the proportions of classical design at least sufficient attractions to detain the attention and delight the fancy few of the characters are well drawn on the whole all of them clever and vigorous and characteristic in parts we do not think there is much continued interest in the fate or fortunes of any of the dramatis personae and it matters very little how the whole narrative endt but the separate incidents are very agreable and very absurd the portraits are certainly not by lawrence but rather in the free style of h b and the whole is an assembly of the most extraordinary people and in the most extraordinary circumstances that ever took place whether we speak of mr phineas cophagus the apothecary at smithfield who was gored by a mad bullturned quaker and so onreturned churchman and so onand then was gored again at the distance of a quarter of a century whether by the same bull or not we cannot savor miss aramathea judd whose character we take to be the most inventive that our author ever imposed on the credulity of his readers that young ladies wearfalse faces we potently believe but seldom with miss judds design of passing for their grandmothers the other is an irish baronet sir h de clare who and his lady turn gipsies and mountebanks and what not as for the hero of the tale himself who mistakes every man with a long nose for his father and seeing the bishop o exeter the then bishop enjoying an unusual longitude of proboscis fixes on him as his parent to the no small astonishment of the virtuous prelate who cures lady maelstrom of hysterics by pouring a bottle of marking ink into her mouth instead of eaudecologne and then to correct his mistake bv following it up with a quart of stinking green water where flowers had been placed who passes himself off to lord windermere as his son who is taken up and condemned for highway robbery who is confined in the cellar of an irish castle and all but murdered who gives himself out in london as a young man of ten thousand a year who sets up druggist at reading who turns quaker for love of a young quakeress who finds at last his father looking like a large bengal

and a sufferer of much that is most sad in human life describes with equal candour and vividness though things that she has seen and the sorrows that she has felt its pages are alive with the old sympathy for good women writhing under slander though old abhorrence of certain kinds of masculine selfishness and brutality the old fierce contempt for the malignity and harshness of selfrighteous women  who havo a larger measure of charity for i triumphant sin than downtrodden virtue in i these respects the novel resembles tales that  preceded it but in some particulars the story  contrasts favourably with most works of fiction j which aim at enlisting sympathy in behalf  of women on whom social opinion has put the brand of shame its judgments and indignation are less onesided and defiant than they would have been had the book been written in times less remote from incidents which first inspired the author to exclaim against mnns  violence and womans spite another indica tion of the change which soothing influences i have wrought in a mind that notwithstanding i its championship of injured innocence was  formerly more alert to fight the strong than to i respect the feeble is the tenderness exhibited  towards weak things simply because they aro  weak for instance in all that concerns the l ludicrous repellent imbecility of lady chari lotte skifton mrs norton shows a fine com passion for failings that rouse in ordinary j spectators no kindlier sentiment than derision  but the feature of the book for which the  author will be most commended by moralists is through the goodness of gertrude skifton whose i tribulations are the chief source of the readers entertainment usually in novels written with the special purpose of  old sir douglas the wretched heroine is guilty of indiscretions that give countenance to the assertions of her calumniators but from her girlhoodbefore  she encounters her future husband until ho is i induced to impute to her extreme wickedness and further on through her career until her long endurance of cruel misconstruction terj initiates in the vindication of her honour and  the recovery of his affectionate confidence 1 gertrude hokb the readers unqualified respect j as well as his sympathy guileless stainless i faultless in her nature and life even as she i3 i lovely in person she commits no single act j that she should have left undone and great praise is due to the art which shows how such a perfect woman may by a combination of j untoward conditions and malignant influences j be covered with the obloquy that is the sharpi est part of the punishment which social opinion i  assigns to certain sorts of conjugal infidelity   the woman thus cruelly sinned against though   never sinning is brought upon the scene at   naples whither the old sir douglas ofthe  i titlepage has hastened from his home in scoti land to rescue his nephew and heirprcsump  tive from the hands of profligate associates r and in

uncle for though the  i epithet old  has been attached to sir douglas 3  by his abandoned nephew he is but a i middleaged man at the opening of the i j neapolitan scenes and that readers may r j not suppose him disqualified by years to j j win the love of a young girl mrs norton is careful to endow him with personal attrac j tiveness as well as a sublimely chivalric dis a position there is no example of human t beauty more perfectly picturesque than a very f handsome man of middle age is the bold a statement with which the story commences t and in sir douglass case this grand pictur   esqueness is united with moral graces that j t justify the authors flattering commendations t of middle age as the period of life in which i men of true heroic stuff and mould are seen  to best advantage at the age of which i 1 am speaking says the novelist  small annoy 1 ances have ceased to afflict great hopes and  i fears are subject to a more noble reserve the  passionate selfishness of inexperience has van   ished the restlessness of learning how much or how little life can achieve is calmed down the smile of welcome in such a mans countenance is worth all the beauty of his adolescent years this is both true and happily expressed with respect to those exceptional natures that like fullbodied wines ripen and mellow under the silent action of time and it is none the less true because it may render  old sir doughs popular with certain habitual occupants of seats at clubwindows to whom the praise is by no means applicable every fact of sir douglass career is consistent with the compliments thus lavished upon him by his creator at the outset of the story no taint of selfishness or vanity or hardness alloys though excellence of this perfect model of gentle manliness of whom no less than of the knight in the canterbury tales it may be said thoujh that he was worthy he was wise and of his port ns nieke as is a mayde he never yet no villanie northeast sayde in all

plain language which incline moral teachers to call a spade a spade and the ditterj ences of the uncle and nephew are made all the  more apparent by the manner in which the j story brings them into collision unaware of  his nephews tenderness for gertrude and j naturally inferring from his profligate life that j her simple goodness would of itself inspire him j with a distaste for her charms sir douglas surrenders himself to the girls artless fascina j tions and becomes her accepted suitor the discovery of his uncles success with gertrude  fills kenneths soul with rage and having in past times repaid sir douglass generous love and excessive consideration with insolent words j and undutiful acts  full of that blind and boundless ingratitude which belongs to early youth he now commits a murderous assault on the man who has loaded him with favours and cherished him with more than parental tenderness for a time the uncle and nephew are divided but events bring about their reconciliation so that after kenneths marriage with a spanish beauty they live together in scotland with the outward appearances of mutual amit until sir douglas believes himself to have received conclusive testimony of gertrudes reprehensible intercourse with his lawless nephew in the devices that having first filled sir douglass heart with an abominable suspicion make him at last so certain of his wifes guilt that he condemns her unheard and hastens to though crimea in search of a soldiers grave mrs norton exposes herself to a charge of defective originality but though some of her incidents and one or two of the principal actors in her second and third volumes are conventional and falsethe management of the story not only sustains the readers anxiety for the heroine but also compels him to feel a strong interest in the subordinate actors of the complicated and exciting drama how gertrudes vindication is brought about devourers of novels will like to ascertain for

reviews of books the ring of ama sis  min lrror is the most perverse of authors he has talents of no mean order and if he would bhat do justice to himself he could lot fait at the same time to give pleautre to his readers but he uttorlv refuses to allow any weihlit to such trivial considerations and deliberately injures his own reputation while he insults the audience to which he addresses himself in the present book he has chosen a different means of arriving at this end from that which he has employed before hitherto he has published as his own corlpositions what were little more than renderings of works by other authors he now introduces what appear to be his gtenuine lucubrations as the offspring of anothers brain it is true that the story is not entirely original nor are the philosophical reflections for whose display it forms a convenient vehicle remarkable for novelty but the physician on whom they are fathered is utterly destitute of vitality and his existence is even more improbable than that of the hero of the work we should be glad to think that the dreariness of the tale was due to its teutonic origin but we fear that we must set it down to mr lyttons account as an adapter he may have been somewhat unprincipled but at least lhe was not dull  as a creator he may be honest but he is tedious we prefer him infinitely in the former capacity the  ring of aniiasis in mnany respects resembles sir edward lyttons  strange story each romance outrages probability and sets the laws of nature at defiance without comipunction ini each the narrator is a medical nan deeply versed in the mysteries of science and capable of the most unintelligible language spirits haunt the one as much as the other and both are replete with moral sentiments sufficient in number to stock a writingmrasters copybook but deficient in the force requisite to extricate themselves from the machinery under which they are crushed mr lyttons story is as incomprehensible as sir edwards but the skill which enables the father to keep alive his readers interest is but partially shared by the son the physician to whomn we are supposed to be indebted for the story met its hero on board a rhine steamer and was at once fascinated with his appearance nor is it wonderful that count edniond r produced so instantaneous an effect for so refined was he that  he was almost invisible this description appears a little vague but all haziness of outline is cleared up at once when we learn that he was the iiiip of plastic repose the image did not associate with the other passengers for it enjoyed the habitual consciousness of an unapproachablc high social position which enables the few who possess it to pass through the crowd without ever coming in contact with it but it roused their curiosity and excited their interest at st goar a boy fell into the river aind would have been drowned had it not been for the courage and skill of the mysterious count who calmly glided after him and tranquilly restored him to his mother meanwhile the strangicers wife whose voice was like the sound of a hautbov anwd whose gize was the gaze of the loreley witnessed his performance without evincing the slightest interest in it and  calmly coldy fronin the lofty heights of her chilly selfisolation looked down in silence with the cruel dead tranquillity of her emnpty unansweriig7 extingiushed eye so strange a couple naturally left a strong impression upon the memory of the doctor and he did all that he could to obtain an explanation of the stoniness of their demeanour for a while his efforts were in vain but chance having twice thrown him in the way of the mysterious count he at length succeeded in gaining his confidence and was rewarded by being entrusted with the secret of his life the inevitable packet of letters which extinguishes the hero of the introduction to a romance was put into his hands and he was good enouggh to frame from them the narrative which forms the main part of

review of new boos snecimenls of german romance selected and  ripalnshted from various autth7rs 3 vols post 8 o pp 776 london 18226 whittaker the fertile regions of romance have of late years been much explored and many tales have been translated into english the field is however still ample to afford an abundant harvest even were riot the prolific pens of living authors still adding to the pile the northern nations have poured forth their stores and the whole italian novelists have been resorted to in order to furnish food for the unsatiated appetite for works of fiction which prevails in this country ir soane i who is pretty conversant with german literature has confined himself to tales in that language and if he has not selected the best that exist for this is a point on which persons may disagree he has certainly given us such as deserved to be introduced into this country and these he has translated with much spirit in a brief advertisement the translator says when he commenced this work it was with the intention of carrying it on through many volumes and thus to have presented a complete circle of german romance but circuimstances have occurred to interrupt this project perhaps the stagnation that prevails in the book trade may have bpen the cause mr soane also notices another circumnstance and observes that a work of thig nature allows no compromise with english tastes and feelings but demands that the several tales should be selected with reference to their popularity among germans such n apology is scarcey necessary to a people that have feasted for weeks on doctor faustus and supped nightly for mionths on the sublime horrors of jder ifrieschutz the remark of the translator is however a true one the tales in these volumes are five in nuinber the first the patricians from the gerinan of c f van der velde occupies the wyhole of the first volume while the second is devoted to the master llea of c t a hoffman the third volume contains the blind passenger by f laun the adventurers by a oehlenschliiger and the mantle by b naubert these tales which present all the varieties of tihe grave and the humorous are enriched with three clever etchings

history has interest but the story 1 merely serves the purpose of rendering a note ji book of continental travel over beaten tracts  saleable and is not in itself either complicated 1 l or artistically worked out hugh farquhar is a highlyaccomplished gentleman who exhibits a large amount of booklearning conveyed in very clever and brilliant conversations which it would be delightful to listen to for halfanhour but dreadful to endure for any larger portion of ones natural life his conduct moreover is not at all in keeping or upon a par with that of ordinarily decent persons of his ser and the presence of the naughty italian woman under the same roof with his wife is an offence against goodbreeding and good taste which would be simply impossible in real life on the part of such a character the secretdoor in tile library is unworthy the writers inventive power and indeed the whole conception of the incidents to which it leads is faulty and improbable but that portion of barbaras history which occurs previous to her removal from her aunt mrs shakeshaft of stonycroft hall is charmingly told amidst glimpses of english scenery that discover the artist in the author and make those who most desire her success long to find her writing a story that shall rely wholly upon its vraisemblance to realities the most original and bestsustained character in the volumes before us is mrs shakeshaft and wve quite regret to lose her wholly in the second volume and to hear so little of her in the third as for barbaras family the whole might be left out of the book without causing any loss to its interest and with the exception of professor metze the german school is as unproductive of character yet with all its shortcomings barbaras history is replete with evidences of the authors talent clever and brilliant dialogues graphic descriptions of scenery and places with little ripples of wit scintillating here and there and frequent eloquence of language characterise these volumes which have the virtue of retaining the readers interest to the end  barbaras history rn by amelia b edwards tc 3 vols hurst  blackett if miss amelia edwards goes on writing such stories as barbaras history she will on some bright day of a lucky season wake up and find herself famous she hos made great progress since the publication of  the story of cervantes and her other books for children the patient labour of a long apprenticeship has not been without good results to the artist for now that she undertakes to amuse a superior and more critical clas3 of readers she brings to the task qualities necessary for the satisfactory completion of an imaginative work seldom if ever found in inexperienced essayists miss edwards however has qualities superior to mere literary facility and acquaintance with the artifices of her art she has humour insight into character a somewhat extensive knowledge of books and a mind thoroughly feminine in tone but strong enough to pass through fields of thought without leaning on a more powerful intellect wishing to do the lady justice we lay especial stress on our recognition of her strength and ability to stand alone  for while we give her full credit for having written a thoroughly readable and at some points deeply interesting novel we may not omit to state that she is greatly indebted to others for the plot principal characters and general tone of her book we tread on delicate ground and are anxious to avoid misconstruction no eharge of plagiarism is either made or insinuated in what has just escaped us it is quite possible that whilst the author was thinking out her story during quiet country walks and in the silent hours of sleepless nights she never gave a single thought to  david copperfield and  jane eyre a clever shy ugly awkward child of a poor proud selfish gentleman barbara churchill is sent from her dull london schoolroom into suffolk where the little girl has an eccentric aunt named ann shandyshaft a lady of landed property whose whims create laughter for miles around her residence stoneycroft hall the little girls journey from town to suffolk her reception at stoneycroft hall and the character of her relation are extracts from  david copperfield  with a difference little barbaras adventure with the dissenting minister who devours her sandwiches whilst the hungry child looks on feeling herself wronged but unable to defend her rights recalls the scene between david and though waiter in the coffeeroom where the latter drinks off the little fellows ale this is only one of many points of resemblance between barbaras history and copperfields experiences the aunts of the two children are distinguishable only by difference of income and social positionmiss ann shandyshaft being a much grander and wealthier personage than miss betsy trotwoodand by a diversity of taste which impels the latter lady to hunt donkeys and the former to drive pigs the intercourse of the one aunt with her nephew closely resembles that of the other lady with her niece it is however needless to enforce a parallel between the two ladies it is enough to say that it exists and then leave readers to detect for themselves the points of similarity adjoining the estate of stoneycroft hall are the domains of hugh farquhar a gentleman of vast powers and wasted opportunities hugh has travelled read suffered much and scandalised society a good deal more when little barbara crosses his path but though he has seen much of the world he is still a young man his country neighbours think he ought to marry and settle amongst them  but the owner of eleven thousand a year is of another opinion he is a gentleman who scorns social trammels and it is delicately hinted that he nurses a secret sorrow after a years stay in suffolk barbara and the two other principal characters of the tale are separatedaunt shandyshaft sending the child home to her harsh father and hugh farquharthe superb the sumptuous mysterious hughtaking his secret sorrow and flashing eyes to foreign landa after a while barbara is sent to a german college where she distinguishes herself as an artist from this point of the book almost to the end of the story mr dickenss influence ceases to make itself felt and the author works away under inspiration drawn from charlotte brontes novels the life of the german college is the college life of villettewith a difference  barbara no longer a feminine edition of david copperfield becomes a refined spiritualized jane eyre  and hugh farquhar who unexpectedly makes his appearance at the college plays the part of mr rochesteralso with a difference the girl and the man fall fiercely in love with each other but instead of throwing himself at her feet and asking for her hand he strives against a love in the gratification of which lies his only chance of happiness the secret sorrow already hinted at the black mysterious trouble of his days forbids him to make the girl his wife at length the offer is made and he is accepted  but even after matters have reached that point hugh farquhar flies from barbara not daring to marry her in defiance of principle of course the reader assumes that like mr rochester hugh farquhar is already married unable to live away from weird little barbara the tempestuous lover returns and they are married a period of continental travel succeeds the ceremony and after a while hugh reluctantly consents to return to england and settle with his young wife at broomhill as soon as she has entered the old mansion barbara begins to suspect that it contains secret apartments from which she is excluded and a mysterious occupant of those apartments whose acquaintance she is not permitted to make time and accident convert suspicion into knowledge barbara ascertains that a lovely woman is kept in the house of which she herself is mistressa woman of whom her husband has never made mention this is the most exciting part of the story first the reader suspects that hugh like mr rochester has a mad wife shut up in his house then that the mysterious lady is a mistress whom he dares to cherish under the same roof with his wife barbara and hugh at length come to an understanding about the mysterious ladythe husband telling his wife a rigmarole little calculated to impose on so j clever a woman and barbaraclever woman and jealous wife though she isaccepting the flimsy statement but the fire is only deadened i not quenched ere long barbara passing along a gallery overhears her husband in private conversation withins beautiful lodger they are sitting together like lovers the lovely italian woman is passionately reminding hugu of her devotion to him and declaring that barbara will never love him as she maddalena has loved and still loves him pleasant talk this for poor barbara a minute later she hears hugh address the woman as  poa mia barbara stays to listen no longer that same night she flies from broomhill and after sickness and peril makes her way to rome eventually a reconciliation is effected between barbara and her husband  and in order that the heroine may not be censured for pardoning the man who appears to have put upon her the worst affront husband can offer to wife miss edwards covers her hero with so thick and complete a coating of whitewash that there ia not enough darkness left to account for what has taken place in the story it is shown that hugh never married maddalenathe reader thereby learning that his indignation against mr farquhar as a bigamist has been murplaced and that in addition to the pleasurable excitement of reading a good bigamy case he has also the pleasure of discovering that the supposed criminal is innocent the whitewashing goes on it is shown that hugh cannot be said even to have seduced maddalenaaye more that he cannot be said even to have loved her true he was his mistress many years before his marriage  but he was drawn into the affair by pity not love for the woman who threw herself at his feet vowing that she idolised him the process of whitewashing is not yet done it is shown that hugh would have married her if he could have done so  but as her existing marriage with an aged and repulsive husband prevented him from taking that step he promised her never to marry any other woman it is proved also that hugh had long since ceased to give maddalena any special signs of personal favour  and therefore that though he was guilty of indiscretion in harbouring her in though same house with his wife he had in no way been false to his marriage vows it does not seem to strike miss edwards that the statements of this whitewashing part are not only inconsistent with her characters but break down the entire framework of her story it is not very probable that a fastidious refined and highly sensitive mana man without any alloy of physical or moral weaknesswould live with any woman under the circumstances described from motives of commiseration  sensitive men do not love women who throw themselves at their feet and play the part of whipped spaniels licking thc dust off their masters shoes it is simply incredible that a keen flippant sarcastic sceptic like hugh could have bound himself to such a worshipper by an unsought promise never to marry another woman  and even if in a moment of weakness he had given such a promise he most ussuredly would not have regarded it as a valid obligation years after relinquishing personal intercourse with the dishonoured beauty again if that had been the true story of his intimacy with maddalena what reason was there for keeping the matter from barbaras knowledge after he bad married her in fact the apology does too much bringing down the entire structure of the tale with a crash let us however say that we like missedwards all the better for her error con senting to humour the existing taste for bigamy stories she was determined not to make too great a sacrifice of womanly dignity for a consideration she would touch pitch  but pitch white and perfumedpitch which ehe might lay aside with clean hands just as mrs ratcliffe used to season her stories with the requisite amount of ghostly horrors capable of explanation in the last chapter so has miss edwards effected a compromise between her own sense of right and the depraved appetite of the public giving zest to her romance by the introduction of a bigamist who as the curtain falls is proved to be a man of exemplary character what her story loses by this compromise the personal character of the lady gains whether it will not be best for her both as a woman and an artist to have no further transactions with white pitch is a question which she will do well to put to herself,englishfiction_contra
  cripps the carrier cripps the carrier by r d blackmore london sampson low and co  cripps the carrier is not so good a novel as  lorna doone but then  lorna doone  may fairly be said to rank amongst the very best of the novels of our day that fall short of being really great novels indeed since the last of the immortal waverley novels came from the busy brain and active hand which having fought so long were to be so soon silenced the class of writings which though not absolutely historical romances were yet laid in a time and among people different from our own have not been over numerous  lorna doone  may claim a good position among them not indeed with esmond or with barry lyndon the cause of so many tours de force most notably george augustus salas clever  captain dangerous nor with the virginians even but belonging to the school of these and not unworthy with  the cloister and the hearth perhaps fitter comparison may be made for if the story of erasmus father and margaret of the redgold hair be greater the feeling that invests john ridd and his surroundings is more closely akin to the time in which the tale is placed than is mr reades work to days mediaeval it must be at once admitted that as never before mr blackmore wrote so good a novel as his romance of exmoor so never since has he approached very near to it but cripps the carrier is a much closer approach than its predecessor  alice lorraine is indeed very greatly its superior if it possesses many of mr blackmores distinctive defects it also boasts of most of his distinctive merits mr blackmores chief faults are a certain vagueness in his grasp of a story as an artistic whole a confusion and apparent incertitude dependent upon this as well as a tendency to diffuseness  and worst of all perhaps a habit of bringing many of his characters before his readers as if he assumed them to be already well acquainted and therefore deemed it unnecessary to further enlighten them for this reason and because the chief charm of mr blackmore lies in his great descriptive powers and his sharp and sudden analysis of nature more than in his power of telling a story he is seen at his best when he informs some single subject when as in  lorna doone  and  the maid of sker he tells his tale in the first person either as the person most interested therein or as some keen observer the reason for this is obvious enough that he is compelled to hold himself together as it were cannot allow himself to be so carried off into perpetual fresh woods and pastures new as is his wont in other cases moreover no matter how many characters he may bring upon his stage he is compelled to govern their actions by the observation of a single person whereas when dealing with them by himself he seems to get so interested in eaoh one as it arises as to for the time being lose all consciousness of the others the story and indeed all things beside in his anxiety to follow out the feelings of the puppet whose strings he happens at this moment to be pulling suddenly he remembers that he is not writing an exhaustive analysis of a human character and he hurries back with a start  to some other of his creations and in the frequent repetition of this process so much time is lost that the chronicle is at last if not exaotly brought to a lame and impotent conclusion at least considerably hurried and confused in its ending it would be indeed difficult to dramatise one of mr blackmores stories because there is in them so little of dramatic completeness as stories they are incomplete and incoherent as studies of character they are too often marked with sameness but in spite of these defects and the perhaps still greater one that his women are little more than names the fact still remains that it is his power as painter poet and philosopherfor he seems to exercise each of these capacities in his writingsthat make his works so praisedeserving between  lorna doone his greatest work and therefore containing the greater portion of his merits and  alice lorraine in which his defects were most marked  cripps the carrier may take a middle place but if not fairly made midmost then nearer to the latter than to the former novel the story is complicated and apparently impossible in its leading idea which is however simple enough the scene is laid in oxfordshire close to the university town the heroine grace oglander is carried off from her family by the family lawyer and villain of the story luke sharpe and hidden in a remote cottage she believing herself to be acting in obedience to her fathers wishesa belief induced by means of forged letters in her fathers name which tell her that he has been compelled to go to demeraraand to be thirty miles from oxford and her home instead of close at hand the object of this forced abduction has been on the part of the lawyer that she may marry his son christopher who will thus come in for her fortune but who is a manly young fellow wholly guiltless of art or part in his fathers plan luke sharp causes squire oglander to believe that his daughter has been murdered a belief that nearly kills the old man  but in the end the plot is discovered on account of christopher sharpes refusal to be a scoundrel and carry out his fathers plans grace is rescued by cripps the carrier lawyer sharp blows his own brains out and grace marries her lover russel overshute who does not however play any very prominent part in the story because like ivanhoe he is ill throughout the greater part of the tale the probability or improbability of the story need not bo discussed it is the right of the artist if he chooses and if his strength justify it to do as he likes in this matter that chloroform was not invented at the time does not destroy the interest in the

by the side of  girt jan ridd  zacchary had a bright open face with a short nose of brave and comely cock a mouth large and pleasant and mild as a cows a strong square forehead and blue eyes of great vivacity and some humour he had true cripps hair like a hornbeam hedge in the month of january and a thick curly beard of good hay colour shaven into three scollops like a cloverheap his manner of standing and speaking and looking was sturdy and plain and resolute and he stuck ont his elbows and set his knuckles on his hips whenever both hands were empty the contrast between him and his clumsy

led up to a lofty standard pure unselfish good and grandso far as any grandeur can be in the human compoundwatchful over himself at almost every corner of his ways kind of heart and fond of children loving all simplicity quick to catch and glance the meaning of minds very different from his own subtle  also and deep to reason but never much inclined to argue he had a shy and very peculiar manner of turning his eyes away from even an undergraduate when his words did not command assent as sometimes happened with freshmen full of conceit from some great public school the manner of his mind was never to assert itself or enter into controversy he felt that no arguments would stir himself when he had solidly cast his thoughts and he had of all courtesies the rarestat any rate with englishmenthe courtesy of hoping that another could reason as well as himself in this honest and strenuous nature there was one deficiency the rev thomas hardenow copious of mind and active clear of memory and keen at every knot of scholarship patient and candid too and not at all intolerant yet could never reach the highest rank through want of native humour his view of things was nearly always

fine book containing some characters noble in conception and in execution much too to which though incomplete praise must perforce be awarded for the strength shown and through all the book present

the beaten path by eichard l makin new york the macmillan company this is a long american novel which is concerned with life in an american manufacturing town it has for motto the following lines from carlyles  past and present this that they call organising of labour is if well understood the problem of the whole future for all who will in future pretend to govern men the book contains well over 500 pages of small type and compressed to half that length would have been more effective the authors name is new to the reviewer and the book reads like a first effort it is by no means devoid of merit and indeed shows a real feeling for the portrayal of human character through the medium of fiction but if the writer would address a large audience he must learn thoroughly the arts of pruning selection and compression there is very little in this story that is in itself worthless but there is much that does not really pertain to it and therefore is a blot upon it,englishfiction_contra

lyra nicotiana the pipe and the muse edited by w g hutchinson  canterbury poets  series walter scott although though stimulus and friend of many a poet tobacco has we may say at starting inspired little good verse in praise of itself these lyrics of pipe and cigar snuff and cigarette are for the most part very trifling affairs good smokers do not talk about tobacco much less rhyme a pipe is poem enough there are of course exceptions such as mr lowell and mr henley and mr leland but in the main it is the enthusiastic but inexperienced young who hymn the weed tobacco makes for reticence for contemplation tobacco is an oriental grave and sedentary silent and content this little book is a piece of western restlessness and frivolity the best thing in it is undoubtedly mr henleys rondeau  if i were king    if i were king my pipe should be premier the skies of time and chance are seldom clear we would inform them all with bland blue weather delight alone would need to shed a tear for dream and deed should war no more together art should aspire yet ugliness be dear beauty the shaft should speed with wit for feather and love sweet love should never fall to sere  if i were king but politics should find no harbour near the philistine should fear to slip his tether tobacco should be duty free and beer in fact in room of this the age of leather an age of gold all radiant should appear if i were king i less well known but not much less excellent is the same poets  inter sodales    over a pipe the angel of conversation loosens with glee the tassels of his purse and in a fine spiritual exaltation hastens a very spendthrift to disburse the coins new minted of imagination an amiable a delicate animation informs our thought and earnest we rehearse the sweet old farce of mutual admiration over a pipe heard in this hours delicious divagation how soft the song the epigram how terse with what a genius for administration we rearrange the rambling universe and map the course of mans regeneration over a pipe both these poems by the way are more than twenty years old mr henley is represented in all by eight pieces seven of which specifically belaud the pipe a meerschaum for preference it is therefore a little odd to find him figuring in the frontispiece with a cigarette between his fingers mr lowell also praised the meerschaum   the pipe came safe and welcome too as anything must be from you  a meerschaum pure twould float as light as she the girls call amphitrite mixture divine of foam and clay from both it stole the best away its foam is such as crowns the glow of beakers brimmed by veuve clicquot its clay is but congested lymph jove chose to make some choicer nymph and here combinedwhy this must be the birth of some enchanted sea shaped to immortal form the typo and very venus of a pipe and though meerschaum has othor adherents and eulogists among mr hutchinsons poets on the other hand though late mr r f murrays  ballade of the best

pipes an fancy pipesthings jes made to sell but any pipe that kin be bought for marbles chalk or pelf aint ekal to th haver of th pipe you make yourself the prospect of having to make ones own pipe is too alarming cigars cheroots and cigarettes come in for celebration but in the main the book is the book of though pipe as to brands of tobacco the poets are not explicit mr t b aldrich like the late james payn explains that he is addicted to latakia  but the question is left vague by his brother bards we cannot consider that mr hutchinson has done his work particularly well the number of pieces with no signature to thom or any indication of origin is much too large and considering how easy it is to trace the authorship of verses that appear in reputable newspapers it is a sign of carelessness on mr hutchinsons part that he appends to certain selections only  the globe  the st jamess gazette and so i on though editors of these journals would 1 have f urnished though names of their con1 tributors with pleasure again mr hutchinsons notes are very scant in the other anthologies included in the canterbury poets particularly in the case of the sonnets of the century collected by mr william sharp the general editor of the series the notes have been full and interesting but mr hutchinson has only thirteen to a volume of over two hundred and fifty pages there are cases where notes are positively needed or deserved there is a piece of blank verso by mr leland for example inscribed  to w g h ie mr w g hutchinson which we imagine was written especially for this volume  but mr hutchinson does not say so this is the practical end of it  well take tobaccoany kind you like and keep it in a jar of stone or glass  if iu a bag a bladder makes the best and sprinkle it with old jamaica rum note that the rum should bo extremely good for much depends ou it then you will find it gives peculiar fragrance to the leaf like that of the havanas which we had all in though olden time

new novels katharine frensham by beatrice harraden blackwood  sons a lasting affection for a story called  ships that pass in the night may be a readers misfortune but is certainly neither his nor miss harradens fault but it does obscure the merits of some of her other stories this one is a study in temperaments not altogether well realized we have a man afflicted with too tender a conscience too sensitive a nature and too slender a power of expression restored to happiness and a balanced mind through the sympathy and devotion of the woman who gives her name to the story thornton as he is called is a distinguished man of science though the true scientific attitude and nature do not seem well suggested an unsympathetic and exacting wife has from the outset of their union wrecked his peace of mind and his career and even helped to spoil the affectionate relations between the father and his boy thornton is represented as being of so unselfish and chivalrous a nature that he finds it impossible to take his courage in both hands and end this distressing tyranny but at length and on this everything is supposed to turn he in a dream in his study speaks his mind and she also in a dream in an upper chamber becomes suddenly conscious of the true state of his feelings towards her the horror of this telepathic revelation kills her the situation is not easy of acceptance apart from that its effect on the nature of such a woman as she is made out to be is rather incredible a somethiog farfetched and laboured about much of the plot and circumstance is a contrast to the air of spontaneity and ease of ships that pass in the night the influence of the good heroine almost immediately sets in but she is not permitted to restore the sufferer wholly till the end eemorse reserve and a poorly imagined female evil genius stand between the pair whose respective auras as we are told with wearisome frequency are an excellent match a want of simplicity and too much iteration in the dialogue and sentiment are very visible to like the perfect woman nobly planned before whom everybody in a book falls in worship is perhaps always a little difficult a great part of the action of the story passes in norway and so we get some pleasant descriptions of the manners and customs of the country a very vivacious old danish governess is much to the fore throughout  katharine frensham by beatrice harraden blackwood 6s preliminary paragraphs have made it clear to all men that miss harraden has spent considerable time in norway during the preparation of her new romance otherwise the reader might be tempted to suspect that she had put in her local colour from a volume of travels and a phrasebook surely an experienced author should be too wise to let her background transform itself into a foregroundr yet this is what occurs throughout the novel miss harraden cannot convince herself that close accounts of norwegian local customs do not conduce to the dramatic effect of a story which concerns itself after all with english people and that atmosphere is not to be conveyed by scraps of foreign dialogue with translations in brackets the human problem set forth in katharine frensham demands a treatment more profound and subtle than the author has accorded it in one of his strongest books william dean howells wrought out with relentless logic the effect produced on two sensitive natures by an imagined guilt and a haunting dream here the motive is similar clifford thornton cannot rid himself of the sense that he is guilty of his wifes death because in a dream he has uttered his longrepressed bitterness and she in a dream heard his arraignment peculiar insight and skill are needed for such a psychological problem but in  katharine frensham  it is comfortably clear all along that clifford is going to escape from the shadows which indeed are only there to emphasise the coming light the book is pleasantly written and  knutty the quizzical danish governess is an amusing acquaintance but though  katharine frensham  may be a cultured and pleasing story it is not life or in any true sense literature,englishfiction_contra
white and black a story of the southern states new novels 3 vols hurst  blackett england has pretty well recorded her views upon slaver there are various ways of testing a mans practical faith in his own opinions no belief can get itself established until it hos had martyrs who have dared to die for it people have ventured to suffer shame ignominy and the loss of all things sooner than depart from what they believe to be right short of these extreme testimonies but still a tolerably sharp practical test of a mans sincerity in his profession of faith is his willingness to pay down an inconveniently large sum of ready money for it men may sign bills as they run up bills without realising the fact but to pay ready money is a dead lift out of a mans pocket about which there is no charming illusion except in those oldfashioned plays where mr t p cooke as a sailor on shore representing the old british navy used to take out a long purse stuffed at each end with soidisant bank notes and guineas and hand it with an inimitable heartiness saying  here messmate take this it is prizemoney taken by the timbuctoo and his virtue was enthusiastically rewarded by the whole house but when it comes to paying the consciencemoney to a gruff stoneyvisaged taxcollector who never says or feels a  thank you kindly then paying for a principle sustains a tolerably strong test for everyday wear and tear now england has done this and more than this to express her detestation and abhorrence of slavery  and england more than any other nation has that quality which jockeys call stay in a horse and without which no generous enthusiasm is worth more than a flash in the jiangood to kindle but worthless for warmth now what england bas done once she can hold on by in all its consequences without weariness or fickleness the hatred of slavery by englishmen is a thing said and done and settled we have no more enthusiasm to bestow upon it all that goes now to feed our persistence in our opposition to it we do not talk about itwe do not discuss itbut we continue to pay taxes to suppress it wherever we find it whilst doing this like britons we must enter an emphatic protest against being bored with it in our novels and books of amusement exquisite white heroines who somehow turn out to be black in the course of the story and so can legally be treated as if they were tables or chairs or dogs or horses areto be pitied and we do pity them and we have pitied them accordingly but when under the pretence of amusing us we are presented with three volumes full of abolition speeches and details of all that a delicatelynurtured and highlyeducated young lady must feel who having been brought up as an heiress and in ignorance that she has isegro blood in her veins ami whose father is a furious brute who to revenge himself on an abolitionist sells his daughter down southor to have details of all the domestic misery jealousy and cruelty which the female quadroon slaves bring to the lawful wives may be all very true  but it is a great bore to listen to a sermon on doctrines we have lived by and accepted absolutely for years  precher un converti is the deadliest infliction that human ingenuity can devise short of bodily torment white and black is a good sensible novel of the kind the arguments and illustrations are all of our own persuasion irene is a heroine who is very troublesome to her friends and who might have kept out of all the adversities and dangers which befell her if in the beginning she had listened to advice and used some common sense but as she was predestined by the author to point his moral and adorn his arguments of course she could not help it she was born to ill luck we confess to feeling great sympathy with chauncy burgoyne the fine highspirited planter who becomes converted to abolitionist views and loses his life in their defence the story is as well done as a story of the kind can be but we protest against being dragged through details ofthe evils of slavery from brutal floggings to more brutal love besides which our sympathy for irene is entirely destroyed by the last pagi in the book which casts a doubt on her ever having been good for anything it may be that death has already removed the bonds of the young american girl it may be that she still lins degradtd brokenhearted we can only feel that if she could live degraded after allhehad known and feltand the sacrifices of noble lives that had been made for her she deserved her fate the slavequestion is avenging iself fearfully at this moment in america the halfhearted north is trying to go two ways at once in regard to slavery it wants all the credit of repudiation and all the convenience of cottongrowing slaves freed by othrs it degrades men of colour and makes their condition to the utmost generation that of pariahs pretends to afford them liberty whilst it insults them as human beings has the north dared to accept its own principles and act mi them  has it dared even to right for its belief in the right of slaves to freedom i and fighting for a point is the very easiest and most primitive form of faith in conclusion we beg to enter our own protest against antislavery literature the perverseness of human nature is great and a few more books like uncle toms cabin and  white and black would go far towards turning the current in favour of the masters instead of the slaves,englishfiction_contra

a hard worldlyminded mother who have both united to indulge flatter and spoil him goes to italy in a fit of wilfulness whilst he is thinking that he will study art and paint the great picture which is to confirm all the promise he has given of becoming a great artist and proving himself a man of genius he falls in love with a beautiful english girl whom he sees by accident at some church service he finds that she belongs to a family consisting of the father an invalid the mother this daughter and a young girl her companion they live in a mysterious seclusion absolutely isolated from society in an old palazzo in bologna their only acquaintances are the marchesa who lives or starves iu a distant corner of her ancestral halls and her son guido lamberti the marchesa a bigot under the influence of her priest and the son a young italian of the present day one of the best types of his nation the period is 1848 when the hopes of italy were high for deliveranceare both admirable types of character guido lamberti loves the english girlgilda courtneysilently devotedly steadfastly she loves him like a young girl without knowing it or selfquestioning of any kind sara gisborne her companion a young girl adopted from charity by the courtneys loves him too she is the dark angel of the story one of those black flashing exceptional beings who have one virtue linked with a thousand crimes whose natural element is in melodramas and french novels and whoso bodily sresentment may be seen at the port stlartin laurence carr of carrlyon the hero having seen gilda and fallen in love resolves after the fashion of young men who have been spoilt and who have never had occasion to deny themselves the indulgence of a single whim or emotion in the course of their lives to see more of her and casts about for means of becoming acquainted with the courtneys to this end he displays some ingenuity and by means of an accident created for the purpose by him he gets admitted into their domestic interior the play of the different characters is extremely well delineated mr courtney the father a coldmannered reserved highlybred english gentleman evidently in a wrong positionhis wife delicate sad blameless  but struggling with the influence of some past event which overshadows her life are both very cleverly drawn and give the impression of having been taken from the life the inci dents aro few the interest of the story turns entirely upon the action of the characters upon each other and the influence of their qualities upon the lives and fortunes of each other which is all very skilfully and truly managed carr becomes confirmed in his intention of proposing for gilda in spite of his ignorance of all her connexions and antecedents partly by the discovery of their sudden intention to quit bologna and partly by an illtimed and extremely detestable letter from his mother gilda might not have been likely to acquiesce in his intentions had not sara gisborne to get rid of her rival used all the treacherous and unscrupulous arts which black angels and demon heroines have used from time immemorial she persuades her that guido not only does not love her but that he avoids her hwing suspected her love for him and poor gilda who is guileless as a child recoils in trouble and dismay she works on guidos firide and sense of honour and tells him all the ies she thinks convenient she works artfully upon carr himself she discovers that she herself is the natural daughter of mr courtney and she obtains possession of the family secret of gildas parents this secret is quite dark enough to deter any man who did not love with a devotion and strength of character very rare in the world from seeking their daughter for a wife mrs courtney was a woman of high rank and had been the heroine of a terrible tragedy and cause celcbre she had eloped from her husband her lover had shot him dead in a duel and this was the reason why they were obliged to live in such profound seclusion under a false name gilda of course knows nothing of all this her mother is more than repentant if sorrow could efface crime her father dying of ennui and regret he is anxious to have his daughter married and though he would have preferred poor guido as the one who would have been less likely to be outraged by the knowledge of facts still as guido has drawn back carr cannot be called ineligible and mr courtney resolves to accept him his wife wishes the whole truth revealed courtney like a man decides that it is unnecessary he merely impresses on young carr that the intimacy and proposal had been of his own seeking all the parties act up to their own respective characters and the tragedy of the story results from the natural influence of some quality not exactly reprehensive or some other quality which like the sulphur and saltpetre in gunpowder are harmless until brought together when the result is at the mercy of a casual spark carr marries gilda who is a charming and adorable creature she has told him the truth about guido so far as she knows it herself and then she sets herself to efface the dream of the past and she succeeds it has often been remarked that the daughters of those women who have lapsed from virtue are brought up more carefully and sternly than the daughters of mothers who only know evil by hearsay and mrs courtney has expiated too bitterly the sin of her youth to have left gilda unguarded guido goes away to fight the battles of nis country but not before sara gisborne has made an avowal of her love and been refused in the most chivalrous but decided manner possible being a determined young woman she is not to be repulsed but bides her time and makes use of the knowledge she has obtained to wring terms from mr courtney who dies under the sudden shock of her threats and taunts following up her advantage she wrings from the widow nearly every farthing she possesses and then disguising herself as a boy she enlists as a recruit in the army of charles albert in the same regiment with guido mrs courtney left almost destitute has to accept a home with her daughter and then occurs one of the vital incidents of the story aud one which though possible is too exceptional to make it probable gilda and mrs courtney wish to visit the hospital where the wounded have been taken after the battle of novara carr unwillingly consentshe leaves his wife and mother to go inside and awaits them guido has been wounded and he is the tenant of the first bed they pass beside him sits sara gisborne gilda hears his ravings and recognises that he has always loved her and that sara has lied it is too late now and the pure womanly way in which she clings to the husband she has taken shutting out all regret or thought of the past is very delicately drawn and is charming unfortunately carr hears accidentally that guido is in thc hospital appearances are against gilda but this time her perfect truth and frankness disarm his suspicious nature but the first grain of sand has been thrown in to trouble the waters carrs mother comes to visit them and the mischief and discomfort from the incompatible natures of all the parties are very true to life in the midst of this the malignant jealousy of sara gisborne comes in maddened that gilda has heard the truth of guidos love for her she writes to carrs mother the family secret connected with her sons wife this is well managed the reader is never bewildered into palliating the guilt of the unhappy mother but the sympathy and pity that are roused are none the less strong the interview between carr and mrs courtney is the most powerful scene in the book the secret is kept from gilda but the evil influence it exercises cannot be averted her husband loves her but he cannot forget the blood that she inherits and doubts whether the evil principle has not been entailed upon her along with it and he never really trusts her afterwards sara disappears and leads a life of more than questionable repute till she marries an old mau who is a duke leaving her a widow under some suspicion but she has become rich fashionable and a lionne in society watching over guido in the distance and still biding her time guido poor fellow gets into the way of starvation and in a not very probable or possible way becomes again mixed up with gilda and her husband and again rouses the latent jealousy of carr which has never been quite extinguished gilda has no suspicion of the web of false appearances and false inferences to which her innocent and natural conduct towards guido gives rise it is the curse of her parents sin that is working upon her the working up of the dinotimenl is very interesting but not very probable but the reader will not stop to be critical poetical justice is executed on sara gisborne and laurence carr is left at the end a sadder and a better man than he ever had been before this novel is of a higher class and of greater power than the general run of novels we have indicated the main incidents but it is in the working out of the details that the skill of the author is most shown,englishfiction_contra

are always distinctively absurd and are even relish able for the strong human flavour of that personal twist of character which makes their absurd notions and their peculiar ways of putting them good

i the gay rebellion by robert chambers illus trated d appleton and co 6s the dainty preface to mr chambers latest contribution to the fiction market gave promise of very good fare to follow but after reading the last chapter there is a certain feeling that that promise has not been entirely fulfilled the stories are fantastic and treat of the wearisome  votes for women  campaign combined with the methods of eugenists in some instances companies of fair suffragettes go about with large nets with the object of entrapping after the manner of butterfly catching any man who physically reaches the standard the board of regents have decreed must be attained by those they wed the loss of four of new yorks brightest and best causes two of the hunted sex to go in search of their comrades with dire results love with which the eugenist ladies ought to have nothing to do persists in playing his part so that it is not difficult to imagine where victory finally rests the accounts are lightly handled and there is an occasional flash of humour but the spark is very small if it had been brighter or there had been a greater number the book would have been much more amusing,englishfiction_contra
barren honour a tale by the author of guy livingstone 2 vols parker son  bourn the title of this novel is the clue to the lesson which it is intended to inculcate it is generally considered a high crime and misdemeanour against the laws of novel reading to glance at the end of a book till we have fairly and honestly worked our way through the preceding volumes up to the last page without having a notion wnat we shall find there but nevertheless we believe that by bearing in mind the catastrophe upon which the plot is hinged we are not only able to take a more lively and absorbing interest in the story itself but we are also better qualified to appreciate justly and without bias the powers and abilities of the writer in carrying out the design he has in view we do not therefore apologise for quoting here the last words of the author of barren honour  i have attempted he says to sketch roughly what befell a man very weak and erringwho was often sorely triedwho acted ever up to the light that was given him at the cost of bitter selfdenial and selfsacrificewho nevertheless in this life failed to reap the tithe of his reward alan wy verne was strong up to a certain point but he had not faith enough to make him feel always sure that he had done right in defiance of appearances nor principle enough to keep him from repining at results he could neither comfort himself nor others thoroughly he was a chival rous truehearted man but a very imperfect christian he dared not openly rebel against the laws of god but he was too human to accept unhesitatingly the fulfilment of his decrees throughout alans life honour usurped the place where religion ought to have reigned paramount he shrunk from shame when he would perhaps have encountered sin to that one principlesound enough if it had not been the ruling onehe sacrificed love and friendship and revenge and life thus it will appear that the author proposed to himself no very light or pleasant task when he undertook to prove by relating this story what a barren fruitless dreary comfortless and unsatisfactory thing honour becomes when a man has no higher principle of action no more solid basis on which to rest his future hopes sir alan wyverne had but one great object in life the desire to do his duty thoroughly as a gentleman and a man of honourand he did it but his life was a failure the story is an old one but not the less interesting for that sir hubert vavasour is an honest goodnatured reckless country squire with a mortgaged estate an idle son a lovely daughter and last but not least a clever and intriguing wife alan wyverne the squires nephew is not unlike him in character and the two are sincerely attached still more attached however is sir alan to his beautiful cousin helen and though he knows he has already wasted the chief of his substance in riotous living and that lady mildred will certainly  forbid the banns he nevertheless has the temerity to avow his affection to his cousin as well as to her father and ventures to indulge in some hope that it may be possible to arrange satisfactory settlements enabling him eventually to carry off the fair helen as his lawful prize sir hubert is quite aware of all the difficulties in the path but he cannot resist the temptation to make his daughter and his nephew happy so he shakes his bead and consents but owns he has not the moral courage necessary to announce the awful fact to my lady my lady however baffles them all she caresses her daughter playfully reproaches the culprits plan and fairly puzzles her husband by her tacit acquiescence but in her heart she makes a vow that  it shall never be  she thought that such a weddingdress would become her daughter worse than a windingsheet and she will leave no stone unturned to break off the engagement she goes to work warily and with caution and makes alan feel properly grateful to her for her great kindness and consideration she however contrives to persuade him to wait a twelvemonth before fixing the weddingday and she insinuates that her daughter is exacting and absurdlyjealous for the rest she trusts to her usual good fortune and lies in wait for an opportunity to make the most of the little advantages she has already gained on her sons max vavasour return home the tug of war begins in earnest max openly avows his regret at the marriage having been even so far settled he owns he  has no prejudice against wyverne personally for nobody has such weaknesses nowadays but it is a simple question of political expediency max brings his friend lord clydesdale to the dene it is too late now of course to hope any good can come of that but max and his mother understand each other and they have a year before them yet raoul tenth earl of clydesdale was the premier parti of england and a coarse selfish overbearing illlooking young man but it would have been a very proper match for helen and so lady mildred feels naturally aggrieved at the thought of how much had been lost by alans rash and precipitate conduct lord clydesdale moreover no sooner set eyes on helen than he began to think himself an illused man he could have made up his mind to confer on her the title of countess of clydesdale and he did not see what right wyverne had to secure the young lady without even giving him a choice in the matter it was not to be born with patience his friend and toady harding knowles suggests that many things might happen before the fatal twelvemonth is over  sir alan might die you know or miss vavasour come to her senses harding does not object to laying very long odds say 6000 to 50000 that the marriage will never take place the bet ls accepted and booked with looks of wicked crafty significance by knowles who for some trifling reason hates alan and is sadly in want of money from this moment the plot thickens alan is persecuted by letters with a curious cypher engraved on the envelope lady mildred and her daughter receive anonymous letters warning them to inquire into his conduct during his absences from the dene explanations are given and received but somehow they are not quite satisfactory lady mildred pretends to make excuses for him thereby doing his cause a great deal more harm than good helen has seen mrs lenox once and has heard of her often she is hurt and grieved at what she believes to be alans conduct with regard to that dangerous lady but she trusts him still and would conting to trust him till death only lady mildred takes care to prevent that and alan gives up his case as hopeless and retires from the field this is the weak point of the story it is extremely improbable that a man conscious of his own innocence and aware that a trap is likely to be laid for his ruin would voluntarily sacrifice the woman he loves for the sake of the woman who loves him nina lenox is a careless imprudent creature always in trouble either about love or money wyverne does not pretend to care the least about her but he was goodnatured and helped her out of her scrapes and thought her rather a bore than otherwiseyet sooner than betray her confidence to his future wife even in his own justification he quietly breaks off his marriage with helen and makes both her and himself miserable for the rest of their lives this is the great instance of alans preferring honour to every other virtue or even duty helen not caring much what becomes of her after this marries lord clydesdale and hates him though he frees her father from his heavy embarrassments and saves the dene from passing into the hands of the jew who had intended to secure the property for his own thereby earning for himself the eternal gratitude of lady mildred and her son max we will leave the dinodment of the story to unfold itself to its readers at their leisure feeling convinced that with a little judicious skipping of lengthy digressions and superfluous descriptions of character in the first volume they will never rest till they reach the end of the book there is a most exciting description of a fight with some poachers and another of a hunting feat of sir alans which will delight the male readers of barren honour and there can be still less doubt that every lady will sympathise deeply with the sorrows of the countess of clydesdale and be ready to lament the mistaken views of the too scrupulous sir alan who in everything but this overstrained sense of honour is about as perfect and loveable a character as can be met with in any novel of the present day,englishfiction_contra

the first fifteen years of her life beginning at the age of two when she realised that  big people always get their own way she had a passion for quite new babies but her dolls were stuffed with sawdust and had no charm for her until she learned to read and discovered that one doll in its time could play many parts her dolls were worked hard their lives were short but their existence was full

what she used to see to like and to think when she was a little girl no imaginary heroine could be more delightful or more original she had an extraordinary talent for having adventures with her dolls and then she used to write romances the story of her infantine literary career is full of thrilling secrets and surprises her readers will be glad she never got rid of her scribbling habits as for the fairy stories dr macdonald says his are for the childlike even if they be seventy five but seven and five need not be afraid they are dull for that reason they are singularly beautiful and poetical and children in their quieter moods will find them altogether sympathetic there is such fine good work in them that they should be counted with dr macdonalds best the stories in the  winged wolf

away by revealing tiie form whioh the devil takes but in the morning the jew shoots himself the story is told with considerable talent tersely and without irrelevancies its companion is cast in a lighter vein and smells of seawater ropes ends and shag tobacco the skipper of a small coasting schooner has fallen in love with a boardschool teacher she refuses to marry him until her longlost father is found the skipper proposes a reward to his crew and the consequent adventures of sam dick the cook and the boy henry are to my mind immensely diverting henry above all in prosperity or adversity is a fund of joy generally the laugh is on henrys side but when the gymnasium mistress carried him out of the garden with stolen apples rolling from his pocket the tables were turned for he met the cook outside here is a sample of henrys wit and humour 44 they had got down to the river again and he hesitated in front of a small beershop whose halfopen door and sanded floor offered a

anythin the skipper11 wooing is extravaganza throughout but it shows mr jacobs to be possessed of real humour and humour of a more humorous sort than certain humorists have lately vouchsafed to us taken together the two stories quite sustain the high promise of many cargoes  r the skippers wooing and the brown mans  servant by w w jacobs pearson  co i we do not remember any previous attempt to exploit the language and modes of thought of the east coast smacksmen the rather farcical but honest and successful wooing of capt wilson of the seamew is wholesome and pleasant reading in spite of the occasional failures of his devoted crew of three men and a boy to second his endeavours these simple mariners expose themselves to many adventures and frequent lapses from such cardinal virtues as truthtelling and sobriety in their quest for the missing parent of the fair annis whose hand is to be the reward of success it is possible to read these studies in humble life without the sadness and loathing which attend other realistic descriptions of latterday social phenomena  the brown mans servant is a short and vivid description of a recondite and horrible murder thrown in apparently as a contrast to the pleasant fooling of the longer story,englishfiction_contra
fiction tle yewacomes by kv m thackeiay londlo 3bradbury and evans few works of fict ion leave on the readers mind so strong an impression of reality as this last work of mr thackerays theeasy anl indefinite yetcomplete manner in which its persons and personages are gradually set before us the unforced and apparently artless movement of the narrative tile remarkable naturalness of the conversations and eveni tile occaisioill obscurity of some of the genealogic threads all conduce to this result and we ask ourselves like the author in his last pages can it be that the colonel and

the nobilitys ballrooms are essentially the same beings as those young bucks old fogies and pretty flirts the natives of much inferior social circles higher up are better manners certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of english society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design perhaps mr thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern english aristocratic society his pictures most likely are not faultless whose are a line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study mf r thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the great world itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation a man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation and now what is the nature of this fashionable world according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   vanity fair  pendennis  newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one the land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life mr thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that haut tonne is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of haut tonne can present us for the most part with such elements as these is the marquis of steyne a representative personage and his sister lady kew and the most noble farintosh is miss ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and lord kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman does love among these upper clwases usually signify flirtation and life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the world a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand marriage a convenient arrangement and religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like potichomanie and death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones self a still more disagreeable occurrenceare these the polite definitions l it would appear so perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes but do the middle get off any better rather worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of vanity fair than themselves a doleful and depressing view of human nature surely true we have mr pendenniss mother and lady walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have mr pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model i wife and worship him the colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of mr i thackerays creations we can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement with tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor colonels bedside in grey friars his son clive is our novelists a i sample of a young man handsome lively clever generous goodnaturednon ursiteris extra hle drinks his full share smokes immensely idles in the familiar rooms of warrington and mr pendennis and talks slang there and at the haunt where fred bavham and others have late beer and lobster likes sketching and does it semiprofessionally goes to baden and rome idles there and lets his beard grow falls in love with his cousin the beautiful flirt wishes himself a marquis or duke and hates those who are sulks over his fathers indulgence marries a plump scotch girl and her mother and becomes permanently disgusted with existence in his companion the youngpainter john james tidley mrthackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of i purpose here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of mr thackerays books the author knowing better chooses to iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both we do not desire that the i novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of virtue and vice in manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life there can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin the application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable we speak thus of mr thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to truth with a smile or a wink to fashion in the same moment  praising pilgrim and faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in nuditty fair the chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 vol i p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us there is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in the newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as the kickleburys fur instance which the times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the times compared with other departments of that famous paper the best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a times review in a recent article on james montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of stylerousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  coleridges philosophy and swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated edinburgh reviewer lord jeffrey thus jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of europe and america by reviewing conples positive philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  returning to the newcomes we have to observe that like mr pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the queen of scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous mr thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation a great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist in conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from mr thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated when there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lman is the child of god is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration but the hard material unimaginative truth so i called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe a grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it nve speak of mr thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the english classics we do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal that the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination,englishfiction_contra

  christmas eve on lonesome by john fox jun constable  co mr fox has made some reputation as a successor to bret harte the decay of taste and criticism among the constantly increasing class of novelreaders may account for the success of an imitator whose imitation is so superficial  christmas eve on lonesome  has the sort of scenery and the sort of people that bret harte might have dealt with but it wants the qualities which made bret hartes work the work of an artist it is a story of unexceptionable character the story of a man who went to shoot his enemy but remembering something the prison chaplain had said held his hand it happened that the day was christmas eve but no one knew that it was matter such as this is inadequate for a story of real life in the wild parts of america or elsewhere it is mildly sentimental but not pathetic another story relates a comic incident in the great civil war it shows a good deal of appreciation of the ridiculous but a want of good taste there are subjects which ought not deliberately to be made use of for the purposes of jest among the remaining stories there is one whioh may be read with more satisfaction it is about a dog and it ends happily a word should be said in praise of the coloured illustrations they are exceedingly well drawn and reproduced,englishfiction_contra

latter for in spite of his apology we are deeply affected by the finale of this pathetic drama though we cannot laugh at the homely scenes of vulgar merriment they have however though merit of being cleverly represented and with truth to old customs it is difficult to quote from a production of this kind  we shall however begin with a sample of the notes  forbes of pitnacaddel and his many ecccntricities are still celebrated by tradition ia strathdon the laird was religiously inclined and taking on to college education in his youth besides being proprietor of a good estate he became the minister of his own parish but being like king david a valiant man he determined that his clerical duties should not interfere with the  rights and reasons of a highland laird and he insisted on preaching imho full costume of the claa philibeg and all with a great baskethilted sword by his side when taken to task for this innovation mum the regular canonicals of john alvin  the time being long before the disarming act he defended his conduct by three reasons diiili were the following st that though a iwicher he was a gentleman and so entitled ta wear arms whenever and wherever he isiil jd that he carried a sword because it knew how to use it and hi that if any inn doubted these premises they might put jilin to these proof whenever they chose such reasoning as this was decisive in the highlands isptvially when backed by  college lair and a strong arm  and it appears to have been irre successful than his assertions in bis clerical calling for being an ultra calvinist even unto

his brow and looked fondly and gratefully in his barbaras face as he took the bread and milk from her hands i thought i never saw a handsomer rustic pair they ate their meal with a pleasant countenance and did not discourage the joke and jeer of rustic fun that went round among the reapers and as the latter rose to return to their work i saw a tear steal down barbaras cheek as with some strange emotion she gazed upon her husband  while when the reapers had gone he placet his arm kindly round her waist as il to acknowledge in love and kindness that this was a moment of real happiness

a perfect object of brokendown manhood suffering and despondency th only consolation he appeared to take in life was in the nursing and tending of his little laugh ter but providence in its mystery seemed to have set its mark upon him for even this last tie to the world was threatened next to be torn out of his shattered heart the winter time had set in cauld and grim and a lonely blackness seemed to brood over the ntlhbourhood of leafless carloghie when one dark night towards the middle watches a solitary figure of a woman came stealing towards the farmhouse of reen braes she was dressed richly for a pedestrian yet there was in her appearance and manner au air of wild and rockless dilapidation she sought the window where she saw a light burning i need not say this was the once handsome and proud lady barbara of carloghie with hesitating steps and rising emotion she drew near to the little window there was no screen and she looked in as well as her blinded eyes would allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is far away with them that never loved her as i have done  and now thou art her last saddest remembrancer and cold deaths creeping up to thy young heartand 1 am a bereft and brokenhearted man he stopped suddenly choked by his sorrow and thought he heard a noise without it was barbara groping agitatedly for the latch of the door the sounds were low but became shaip and abrupt and the door moved as if the walking spirit of death sought hasty admission in another instant the figure of a female wanderer stood before him and the pale and haggard countenance of bis own barbara appeared by thc dim light ofthe small lamp more like a deadly ghost than a living being k it is indeed barbara herself she said after gazing ionland sadly in his altered countenance come to lay her head beneath your feet fames

could be spoken as the women that waited without came iu to compose the limbs of the child  its over now and my deeds done said lady barbara rising  it is not fit that i should sit longer in an honest mans house with a steady stop she walked tow ards the door and ere the light of morning lind opened out fairly upon the breaking sky her figure had vanished beyond the fields of the farm and no one inquired whither she went     the fairly kirkyard where mary johnston was buried is pleasantly situated a little above the rtiar water whore the bridge crosses off towards carloghie castle on the night after the funeral james johnston was a  restless mau  and when his frit nils looked in  his pale face and wandering eye they shook their heads and said that it would be well if nothing fearful should happen when the darkness came on however he found himself unable to stay in his house and made his way towards the kirkyard to try to get relief by indulging his sorrow oer his daughters grave it was dark as pitch by the time he entered the little stile and groping among the tomb stones he could not readily find the spot where his bairn lay isle had just found the green mould and the loose sods when seating himself down upon a broad stone lie saw something move between himself and the starless sky but quite near on the oilier side of the grave  who is there  he called out with some

the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the author succeeded in the delineation  the queens manes a romauce of holyrood by g j whyte mielvle two tols parker so  bourn of historical character on the contrary the representatiobs which appear on his canvas are daubs or caricatures the wise and politic rtandolpha worthy ambassador even for queen elizabethbecomies a conceited dancingmaster the character of bothwell has been borrowed from the pretentious doggerel which mvr aytoun published some years ago under the name of a poem the borderer is delineated as from the first the unselfish lover of his queen  anl the brutality and cowardice which he displayed when he hat won the object of this pure devotion are glossed over in grandiloquent and meaningless sentences such as these 1the nman who would once have shed his hearts blood freely to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work there is nothing in the booknot even incident instead of the usual huntingfield with its impossible leaps we have a hawkingparty on the links of saint andrews composed of the queen and john knox than

lucy of the stars by frederic palmer werner laurie 6s let not hope prevail lest disappointment follow is the philosophy ot this story brightly and sympathetically written entirely free from any morbid element dealing with the sunny side of life generally it should be a very pleasant romance and we wade serenely enough through the usual misunderstandings and entanglements secure in the certainty that all is to end well it is literally upon the last page that the tact is brought home to us that instead of a gracefully written comedy we are assisting at a very bitter tragedy on looking back over the pages we realise that we have been led into this trap continually all through the book not once but several times have we seen difficulties surmounted misunderstandings made clear everything apparently on the high road to success only to turn over the page and find ourselves confronted by an untimely death or a lost fortune the story opens with the betrothal of two young people well suited to each other in every way they are separated at the end of the fifth chapter joyfully reunited m the thirtysecond only to be torn ruthlessly asunder and parted for ever on the last page of the book the hero having suddenly under pressure married a heartbroken heiress from america whose own loveaffair with one of the most brilliant and successful politicians of the day has been abruptly terminated by a fatal railway accident the old german savant after a lifetime spent in secretly amassing a fortune for the daughter he worships discloses the fact of his wealth to her to find that it comes too late and that he is only in time to see her die of despair asking himself  what is the good of all my money now even the decadent peer lord carniston ts disappointed in his attempt to commit suicide he dies suddenly of heart failure holding in his hand the laudanum he has not had time to drink it is a pity that such good material should be used on so persistently pessimistic a theme the characters are clearly and consistently drawn the story is well and in places wittily told and ltrey of the stars h a charming heroine there are four unusually good illustrations by mr a kimball  1lovel lkotes lucy of the stars bv 1fredericlk palmer 6s  werner laurie this story begins with a proposal of nmarriage and it would be unfair to the author to say how it end but if it is begun it will not be laid down without reluctance mr palmer who knows how to be able without being cynical or smart has put some strangelymarked characters together in a setting of british societ and american politics and with an unmistakable loveinterest near the surface geraldine and lucy make an excellent antithesis so do the electric vital americans and the earl of arniston in fact the entire tale is interesting not merely as a study in transatlantic colour but from its artistic restraint and unconventional observant style all who have crossed the atlantic whether like lucy on the oceanici or not will appreciate for example the remark  how many friendships formed aboard ship have ended by fates decree rather than by human wish in that dark pier shed which brings ones thoughts from the freedom of the sea to the limitations of daily routine   this is one note of the unforced tragedy which underlies a bright wellwritten story there is promise as well as achievement in it and we shall look for more work from the same pen corydon an elegy by reginald fanshawe henry frowde  lucy of t1lc stars xztt omn by frederick palmer rareiy even in a novel have we encountered a set of people so perversely bent on wrecking their own lives as those who sustain the action of this story and never outside a novel have we witnessed such malevolent strokes of fate as those which still further harass the authors illtreated puppets the net result is that two out of five people marry and live unhappily a third is wantonly done to death in a wholly irrelevant railway accident and a fourth mainly through the blundering of the fifth her blindly devoted father dies brokenhearted the merit of the book lies in the presentation under an unusually attractive aspect of public life across the atlantic in certain latterday phases yet it can scarcely be said to fulfil the conditions requisite for that difficult achievement a successful political novel the differences in english and american character are treated with notable impartiality and on the whole with discrimination but the author has not been equally successful with regard to the differences in speech,englishfiction_contra
selections from the writings of walter savage landor arranged and edited by sidney colvin  golden treasury  series macmillan a landobian anthology has long been wanted and badly to the many landor has always been more or less unapproachable and has always seemed more or less shadowy and unreal to begin with he wrote for himself and a few others and principally for himself then he wrote waywardly and unequally as well as selfishly  he published pretty much at random the bulk of his work is very urge the editions in which he appears are rare or unwieldy or both and the majority have passed him by for writers more accessible and work less freakish and more comprehensible it is probable too that even among those who inspired by natural temerity or the intemperate curiosity of the general reader have essayed his conquest and set out upon what has been described as  the adventure of the seven volumes which were seven valleys of dry bones only a few have returned victorious of course the seven volumes are a world but it is objected the world is one of a peculiar pattern abounding in antres vast and deserts idle in gaps and precipices and  manifest solutions of continuity and enveloped with sn atmosphere which ordinary lung find now too rare and now too dense and too hypnotic moreovor it is peopled chiefly with abstractions bearing noble and suggestive names but all surprisingly alike in stature and feature all more or less incapable of sustained emotion and even of logical argument all inordinately addicted to superb generalities and a kind of monumental skittishness all expressing themselves in a style whose principal characteristic is a magnificent monotony and all apparently the outcome of a theory that to be wayward is to be creative that human interest is a matter of apophthegms and oracular sentences and that axiomatic and dramatic are identical qualities and convertible terms this is the opinion of those adventurers in whom defeat has generated a sense of injury and an instinct of antagonism others less fortunate still have found landor a continent of dullness and futility have come to consider the seven volumes as so many aggregations of ennui suoh experiences are onesided and partial no doubt and considered from a certain point of view they seem worthless enough but they exist and by existing they are in some sort justified landor when all is said and done remains a writers writer and it is impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with those who hesitate to accept him for anything else the number of those who do sofrom ignorance or distaste or downright stupidity is large it is probable however that by the publication of the present volume their ranks will be thinned perceptibly and their pretensions considerably abated mr colvin is a determined landorian  but his landorism is neither pedantio nor fanatical and has in no wise debauched his humanity his judgement of landorconveyed in a prefatory note which is certainly one of the best of recent yearsis exceptionally generous both in essence and substancetoo generous i think to be final but it is nicely balanced on the whole and strikes a possible mean between the enthusiasm of disdain and the enthusiasm of admiration mr colvin takes cognizance not only of what is good and sound in his author butto a great extentof what is bad and false as well he is quite willing to recognise the fact that the author of landors unpopularity is mainly landor himself and that unique as was landors talent and notable as is landors achievement the world is not altogether to blame for the attitude of indifference it has hitherto maintained to them he claims much for the man and perceives a vast deal in the work but he admits more or less explicitly its many faultsits abruptness its inconsecutiveness its want of tact the unreality of much of it the egotism of all his object has been to produce a landor who shall be generally acceptable a landor that is to say whose blunders shall be corrected and whose better qualities alone shall be in evidence this object he has attained and eminently well planned and brilliantly executed his work is really a model of its kind it takes rank with the best anthologies in english and i cannot choose but believe that it will succeed in conquering for landor an enduring popularity and will remain the textbook of his fame and the proof of his greatness as a writer i have already referred to mr colvins preface i shall add that it contains among other notable passages an analysis of the classic and romantic methods which is comparable with heines own the book proper is divided into three parts the first  dramatic and narrative is subdivided into two sections  of specimens of landor at his best and most coherent as a writer of what it appears to be the proper thing to recognise as  drama and of landor at his best and stateliest as a storyteller and an artist in allegory in the first one is surprised and not pleasantly surprised to find extracts from the  conversation between peter the great and alexiswhich mr colvin obligingly describes as this fierce historic satireand that between fra lippo lippi and pope eugenius which contains some of the worst  comedy  ever perpetrated even by landor the rest of this section has been chosen with perfect tact as has the whole of the second of the second part which is split up into nine subdivisionsof religion of love and human nature of  literature and language and so forth the interest is purely gnomic it is admirably edited and its effect is extraordinary such a hoard of verbal jewelsof maxims cut like gems and sentences that ring like golden oracleshas not before i think been brought together the lustre it reflects upon landor considered merely as an artist in words is remarkable never before have the dignity aud beauty of his style asserted themselves to such purpose  never before has the ocular proof of his genius as a writer appeared so majestic and so overwhelming the third partof extracts  personal and autobiographicalaffects us in a different way before we have only admired here we learn to love before we have dealt with landor the writer here we are brought face to face with landor the man the effect is irresistible mr colvin has performed hi task with infinite delicacy and skill and by selection and arrangement merely has given us a better and a nobler landor than we ever knew before no doubt the landor existed but he existed in seven volumes and his aspect was vague and nebulous his editor may be said to have rescued him from himself to have made him organic and comprehensible and to have set him full in the light of that affectionate immortality which is after all his due i regret that the space at my disposal does not permit me to do more than refer in passing to one or two of what i conceive to be the weak points in mr colvins preface as i think for instance he is grievously mistaken in his estimate of landor as a dramatist and i cannot ohoose but quarrel with his attribution to landor of the gifts of heroic imagination and a sound creative faculty to many of us landors imagination i3 not only inferior in kind but limited in degree his creative faculty is limited by the reflection that its one achievement is landor his claim to consideration as a dramatio writer is negatived by the fact that poignant as are the situations with which he loved to deal he was apparently incapable of perceiving their capacitiesinasmuch as he has failed completely and logically to develop a single one of them inasmuch too as he has never once succeeded in conceiving much less in picturing such a train of conflicting emotions as any one of the complications from which he starts might be supposed to generate to many of us there is nothing greek about his dramatic work but the absence of stage directions  and that quality of  landorian abruptness whioh seems to mr colvin to excuse so many of its shortcomings is identical with a certain sort of what in mea of lesser mould is called stupidity w e henley,englishfiction_contra
  ashiros kassi the copt a romance of modern egypt by edwin de leon late united states consulgeneral for egypt chapman and hall oriental social life is a tolerably new subject for a novel and mr de leon has succeeded in producing by help of it a very readable and interesting volume his official position and long residence in egypt have evidently given him exceptional facilities for becoming acquainted with eastern customs throughout the book a feeling of sympathy with and appreciation of the modern oriental is apparent marking the superior adaptability of the travelled american to the travelled englishman there is none of the intensely patronising assumption which our own countrymen are in the habit of using when describing their dealings with an inferior race  and with the exception of lady duff gordons letters from egypt we do not remember any more appreciative descriptions of oriental society the story opens at the hotel dorient in cairo in which is assembled a party consisting of mr van camp who is described as a genuine knickerbocker his daughter the heroine of the story her brother a young englishman who with a republican indifference to titles is sometimes styled  sir charles  and sometimes  my lord and miss priscilla prenmiris a strongminded spinster of the modern american type the hero of the story askaros kassis appears on the scene and enchants the fair young american by his general appearance and feats of horsemanship this paragon of an egyptian has had every advantage as to training and education having been sent early to england and instructed at eton miss van camps brother who it appears has partaken of similar advantages at once recognises askaros as an old schoolfellow and a close intimacy ensues it appears that askaros has incurred the hatred of the then viceroy abbas pasha by putting himself under the powerful protection of one of the consulsgeneral accordingly he is soon seized by the viceroys order and imprisoned in the citadel of cairo but not until he has succeeded in making himself useful to miss van camp by twice saving her life the consulgeneral on hearing of the imprisonment of his favourite demands his liberation and the unfortunate viceroy is heavily browbeaten by the unbending consul askaros is liberated but having been concerned in an intrigue with a princess nezle a relation of the viceroy which now threatens to produce unpleasant consequences ho thinks it best to leave egypt and finally seeks the protection of the great sheik abou gosh of the beni hassan who is then encamped with his tribe in the valley of jericho meanwhile the american party in company with sir charles who is an avowed admirer of miss van camp have proceeded up the nile to luxor from whence the englishman is recalled by the news of his fathers death and his accession to his title when next the party meet it is in venice the americans travelling there for pleasure and askaros having been exiled from egypt here miss van camp and sir charles quarrel and askaros marries the heroine whom he takes back to egypt of the succeeding adventures the abduction qf the wife of askaros into the pashas harem and finally the murder of abbas pasha we can only say they are related with considerable dramatic power and that the author shows a minute acquaintance with his subject though abounding with startling incidents the book ia not sensational in the modern sense of the word and the reader who desires some acquaintance with eastern life and habits of thought will do well to read  askaros kassis the copt,englishfiction_contra

great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student

  roman bitnet by georgia wood pang born houghton mifflin  co the country which lies over against canada bounded on the north by the st lawrence river and on the east by the adirondack mountains has furnished excellent materials for several american novels the mixture of races and especially the french strain among the people suggests good studies in characters of unfamiliar kinds the author of  roman biznet seems to be well acquainted with the land and people and she has made good use of her knowledge and experience biznets father with some blood of an old french family in him was a vagabond wanderer and a heavenborn musician and the authors interest in her work is mainly concentrated upon showing what would happen to the son of such a man brought up in more favourable circumstances the character is cleverly worked out and the only fault to be found with the book is that the author cultivates a taste for obscurity in phrase as well as in her method of narration it is a tribute to her skill to say that the reader finds himself drawn on to read the book through and to admit a little reluctantly perhaps at the end that the task is not so bad as he expected the following is a specimen of the sort of thing that impedes one in the course of the story and in all these dreams there was a jekyllhyde polarisation of two men distinct though folded up in each other like spheres united by that incomprehensible fourth dimension which mathematicians find amusing nonsense like this with a ridiculous affectation of learning is apt to turn a readers attention away from the real merits of a by no means incapable study of an interesting bit of character,englishfiction_contra

the deud secret new hovels by wilkie collins 2 vols cranbury  vanswo injustice will be done to mr colling if we trace the outline of his story before estimating its qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage becomes transparent in the opening chapters to all resent and to come therefore be it known that porthgenna tower with the premises adjoining is the tomb aud temple of n great family mystery captain and mrs trevertonthe former the lord of lands and monies the latter the daughter of an actress have there their local habitation  with them resides their only child rosamond mrs trevertons servant is called sarah leeson and in the first scene this woman is summoned to the deathbed of her mistress she is compelled by her domestic allegiance to write a letter to her master which the wife signs anil the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both be dont talk so dont talk so tellme quietlydear dear mother tell me quietly hush hush i am going to tell you she threatened me on her deathbed if i thwarted her she said she would come to me from the other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead

itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

every day leaner of course and does not habitually straddle whiskers and morals i mean we must be silent before our prudish sister not a prude we talk diplomacy dearest he complains of the exclusiveness of the port of oporto and would have strict alliance between portugal and england with mutual privileges i wish the alliance and think it better to maintain the exclusiveness very trifling but what is life  and now for the hero and heroine the character of evan harrington is most artistically pourtrayed the very opposite of his intriguing sister frank and openhearted to a fault keenly sensitive to his sale position and yet halfreconciled to it by his absorbing love for rose ready to sacrifice his best and brightest hopes to save his sisters reputation fighting the hard fight between love and duty selfrelying and at last selfconquering the tory of his trials cannot fail to excite the deepest interest and sympathy in the reader and what of roserose the proud and defiant beauty yet gentle and loving withal full of unwavering confidence in the love of the man whom she loves regardless of his plebeian origin and the worlds verdict for all this however we fear rose will not be a general favourite with readers of her own sex tiere isa waywardness in her character which however true to real life ought not to be left unexplained by the novelist who is behind the scenes and directs the complex machinery of human character to our mindwill mlr meredith pardon the simileshe resembles a kitten which as long as it is stroked in the right direction purrs on complacently andt pleasantly enough but rub it against the grain and lo  the fur crackles and the claws are unsheathed incontinently humanity however is frail and if we will insist on the novelist making human nature his model is it fair to complain that the result of his labour does not reach our own ideal standard of perfection the remainder of mr merediths diramatis persona being mainly papas mniammas

of that blessed institution to novel writers and dramatists the dens ex inzaripm ihe plot however is deep and involved and we therefore must not grudge the author the recognised means of extrication

forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends who were neither slow nor cold in recognising the merits of his earlier stories and who sincerely regret the imperfections of his present book he clearly stands in need of repose and we urge him to rest now so that heand wemay be thankful for better work hereafter,englishfiction_contra
the hippodrome there are three items at the hippodrome this week which require to be seen the first is the performance of monsieur jules moy who is described as a parisian humorist the second the dances of the moscow xa sthetic troupe including madame elena knipperrabeneck and the third the acting of the sicilians headed by giovanni grasso monsieur jules moy is much more than an ordinary entertainer at the piano he is an exceptionally able actor who gives character sketches to his own accompaniment and he sings as well as he acts the way in which he turns himself without any makeup wig or accessory into a ballet chorus master and conducts a rehearsal with an unseen typical prinza ballerina is really a thing to remember his attempts at diplomacy which give way to artistic despair his sudden leapings away from the piano to give personal advice of the most intricate nature and his illustrations of intricate dance movements are inimitable he is a masior of imitation and not to see him is to lose an agony of laughter of the moscow aesthetic dancers it is difficult to speak too highly for the most part they are very young and beautiful women who give a series of delicate and imaginative interpretations of the music of grieg schumann schubert gretry and rameau they enter a stage devoid of all garish scenery and hung with curtains of plain colours they are dressed in kiltlike diaphanous garments and all their movements and postures are classical and exquisitely graceful the whole  turn  is original delicious and refreshing of its kind it is the best that has been seen in london there is no mordkin to strike a jarring note as for the acting of giovanni grasso it is a revelation there is nothing that he cannot and does not do it is as easy for him to be comic as tragic gay as giave his is the acme of acting there is no actor onl the french stage who can be placed in the same class and lie reduces english acting to a pitiful absurdity he has nothing to help him he is in no sense of the word good looking he plays men of the people in their hideous epping forestlike clothes with bell trousers and cap but his sincerity is so tremendous his art so perfect and so spontaneous that lie holds his audience spellbound he is that rare thing a genius miss marie tempest is also on1 the bill she makes her appearance in what is described as a  playlet  called  the sheariiig of samnson it is a feeble little thing in which miss tempest sings two songs the frenchl one is perhaps worth hearing  the hippodrome by rachel hayward 6s heine mann a novel that excites with its incidents and at the same time satisfies with its characterisation is not very frequently met with miss hayward certainly fulfils both the demand for adventure and the desire that adventure should be worked out through living people and not by means of labelled shadows but  the hippodrome  would have been more aptly entitled  fatalit fate undoubtedly met arithelli when she alighted at the railway station at barcelona in the person of count poleski a devoted member of a gang of russian anarchists the cleverlycontrived plot centres in arithelli a girl of haunting beauty who becomes chief equestrienne at the barcclona hippodrome she finds the famous spanish city a veritable  entresol de lenfer but escapes unscathed from its gross temptations inevitably through her friendship with poleski she gets mixed up with the anarchists and is taken like a bird in the fowlers snare vardri another member of the gang with whom she falls in love attempts to free arithelli and himself from the clutches of sobrenski the leader arithelli is portrayed with care and deserves the pains the author took in her delineation the theme is full of dramatic scenes and its interesting possibilities are developed into an enthralling story,englishfiction_contra
the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a printers error,englishfiction_contra

a great mystery solved a great mystery solved being a sequel to the mystery of edwin drood by gillan vase london  remington and co the  mystery of edwin drood  is no longer to be regarded as a mystery under the very promising title of  a great mystery solved we have here a book destined to end the worlds suspense and to quiet all regret that the  fragment of a story so full of promise how condescending to be sure to the late mr charles dickens  could not be finished by the great man who commenced it mr gillan vase is the name of the heroic mortal who has not feared to puck up the pen fallen from the dead hand of charles dickens and to finish off his incomplete work for him courage rather than modesty would appear to be the distinguishing virtue of mr gillan vase he does not himself appear to be afflicted with any timidity about this  ambitious attempt to finish a work commenced by one of englands most illustrious writers  but since  it has been deemed advisable we presume by mr vases publishersthat he shouldnot apologise of course but let us say offer some explanation to his readers for what he aptly describes as this  audacious venture mr vase with some naivete proceeds to relate how he came to enter upon the undertaking some years ago then mr gillan vase first read the fragment of the  mystery of edwin drood grieved at the abrupt interruption of the story he waited impatiently in the hope that some one else some one of dickens many literary friends would gather up the broken threads and weave the story to its end mr vase had apparently overlooked the note affixed to the last number of  edwindrood in which the friends of mr dickens stated their belief that what the author would himself have most desired was done in placing before the reader without further note or suggestion the last pages written by him only a few short hours before his death at any rate mr gillan vase grew weary of waiting and brave man that he is began to solve the mysteryat first only for himself and for some appreciative friends but after a little while a very strange thing happened something stirred within mr gillan vase  something strangely like ambition1  i soon discovered he observes almost to my consternation that i had entered upon a road from which there is no turning back even though only the grisly hag disappointment should be in waiting at the end i had raised a monster which took possession of me body and soul for whoever takes up an authors pen however thoughtlessly is very soon not its master but its slave wc are not quite sure whether the last somewhat alarming statement is to be taken as applying to the pen of authorship generally or whether it applies to the special case of picking up other peoples pens and adopting so far as ones ingenuity admits of ones doing so their manner of writing but in thc latter case thc observation is singularly appropriate a distinguished american medium has we believe claimed to have received the only time and authentic conclusion to thc mystery ol edwin drood  from the spirit of charles dickens himself i mr gillan vase it will be observed does not claim to be the spokesman and slave of the spirit of dickens but only of his pen and this exactly represents his position he uses indeed the selfsame pen and dips it in the selfsame inkand forms his handwriting upon the same model but if the pen be the pen of dickens the hand which holds it and the spirit which guides the hand are those of mr gillan vaseof mr gillan yrase with a  something stirring within him strangely like ambition we are not quarrelling with mr gillan vase because of his ambition vaulting ambition is no crime in literature even when as sometimes happens  it ocrleaps itself the head and front of mr gillan vases offending is not that he has attempted to continue dickens to the best of his ability and has fa lcd but that he has with a great deal of perverted ingenuity set seriously to work to mimic dickens and in a lamentable way may besaid to have succeeded it is the reverse of the old fairy vale when straw was spun into gold mr vase has indeed gathered up in his hand the broken threads of th story but these threads of pure gold have magically and imperceptibly become transformed by his touch int common straw and the worst of the matter is that it is extremely difficult to realise afterwards that

  lord of the world by robert hugh benson pitman  son mr benson is always so frankly and enthusiastically ecclesiastical or theological that he disarms criticism in a lay paper he has devoted his genuine literary gifts to the polemics of the roman catholic church and is as prolific a controversialist as that ancient establishment can boast not that he adopts the ordinary methods of breaking a lance with heterodoxies he has always used fiction as a means to the end his latest book is rather an extravagant example of his methods it is an imaginative picture highly coloured of the world at some future date given over to unbelief and utilitarianism in this world the roman catholic church alone survives as a depository of faith and the struggle ends in the practical destruction of the papacy shrinking for refuge to a humble home in nazareth apparently the struggle is signalised by the appearance of a benevolent antichrist but we do not pretend to follow mr benson in these somewhat incoherent imaginings we gather that the book ends with the end of the world judged as fiction it shows that an emotional brain of a distinctive character is behind the writing but its impassioned faith is the prevalent note and everything else is subjected to this,englishfiction_contra

offer speaking a language is a very different thing from teaching it and i have never taught he said these last words in a tone of apology for himself or his patrons or both when his head grew tired

wendelas nature was less sweet than reinouts through her husbands eyes she probably descried clearly one day the halo round her fathers name for the comfort of the world be it said a few scandalous

the man in the ca8e by elizabeth i stuart phelps constable  co it is rather surprising to find a veteran like the author employing a plot so worn and transparent as the plot of the man in the case  but she has certainly managed to make her story attractive her hero is not unfamiliar to the reader of novels but he is an excellent specimen of his kind and she has succeeded in making him lifelike and in enlisting our sympathies for him she has perhaps been less successful in her heroine who is certainly amazingly lacking in good sense although the author seems to be unaware of the fact the scenes of count ry life in new england are painted with skill and although the book is in no respect remarkable it does the author no discredit,englishfiction_contra

monthly review of literature domestic and foreign gaston de blndeille or the court of mharu iii keeping festival in ardxen a rolwe by mrs raddiffa 1826 in the memoir of mrs radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes there is so comprehensive and altogether so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy ite breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this her farewell effort anticipating as we did a reawakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon st aubin and emily and provence and languedoc and the apennines and the midnight airs of as was insinuated departed spirits alas alas gaston de blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to the writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward as she does a realghost upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes under her hands having produced such exquisite effects the accumulation and realisation of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent or more but this opinion every reader of gaston de blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory the effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department now we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature the primary ones themselves i love hate ambition jealousy avarice have f their entrances and exits inthe breast but  c these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so i large a space in the basis of all characters c that they are usually and readily excitable ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production and a after even the fullest development require li but a very brief suspension to recruit their d forces but with the lesser and secondary t and artificial tastes those associations which ti are no more than the reaction

a murderer to justice these worthy persons however one and all are far more afraid of the secular than the spiritual arm and not one of them has virtue or nerve to boldly help the demon in his persecution of a royal favourite the old plea of magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt afforded by the spectre here was a dilemma for the authoress and she found no escpefor like the egyptians of old whatever ghost did was supposed imitable by man but the end must come sooner or later

the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political

best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in

goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of

new novels in summer shade by mary e mann 3 vols henry  co by a judicious use of padding miss mann has managed to expand into three volumes a story which might well have been told in one to put it plainly the story which undeniably has some good points about it drags dreadfully in the telling the central idea of claudes gradual conversion from contempt to love for mary burn is well conceived and the characters of claudes brother the bigoted clergyman of the heroines father and mother and of the heroine herself are well drawn but claude himself is unpleasant and it is difficult to understand how mary could ever have become so devoted to him as she is besides the book would be immensely improved if it ended with the lovers reconciliation after their first quarrel the second appears to be unnecessary and the whole history of the sisters adventure in london is sufficiently improbable altogether it is a depressing book with its narrowminded earson and his silly wife the pompous ero the sodden millionaire the decayed father and mother and the loutish lover still much is to be forgiven in a novel like this where the characters are not mere puppets but living beings even if we do not particularly care to know about their doings  in summer shade by mary e mann 3 vols henry and co  in summer shade is an excellent storyat least it is excellently told to some of the incidents we bear a grudge but in very few recent novels will there be found anything approaching its grasp of character and firmness of touch the writer looks at life with a very straight eye she certainly does not err on the side of idealising character and is not at all averse to laughing at those with whom she is on friendly terms the burnes householdthe weak amiable brokendown father the mother with her gypsy blood and her tawdry indolent ways and the family of beautiful daughters that have struggled up somehow without education or ready moneyare capitally drawn mary the heroine is a most faulty young woman she very often does not do her duty she is reckless and bold of speech and absolutely lacking in judgement where her own affairs are concerned she is also worldly but we understand the fascination exercised by her warm vitality her infatuation for the highbred poorsouled claude is as irritating as the things one hears of in real life and we hand mary over to her fate with a wrench of disappointment and mourn deeply the fate of the boorish honest bob and the generous spoilt and drunken spilling but if we differ from the authoress on some points of procedure she has our interest nevertheless all along her charaters are not made of ink and paper but of flesh and blood and her book has no flimsiness in either its thought or workmanship  in summer shade bv n1x l f 1nlann by i iolin lonii wc have learned to expect something pungent and stimulating in each of mrs manns took anl there can be no disappointment here though we have met another girl like her heroine mary in her pages before we dont complain ihe proud energetic uneltih creature struggling with alverse circumstances mande on one side better on the other worse by poverty is attractive enough to le welcome in many guises the picture of the outatelbows burner houselhold is matterlv and the sepirate portraits of tile rector and his 9tatelv brotlhlr claude are a11so excellent one grievance we have rnted her material the story could 1 no possibilitv have ben at once sincerely and uniformly agreeable but the unluck that dogs poor bob burton is too consisent we have the conviction that he was only killed in the end by the author that her favourite malv who with all her sterling qualities dearly loved fair externals might make a more brilliant mirriage with ee of convcleme,englishfiction_contra

novelists license and invested them with those delicate hues of poetrv which are necessary to lignify them to our fancies and to give them an interest that of themselves they do not commnanl hence it is not imlrolable that some fastidious realers may exclaim against the familiarity of many of the lialogues and object to the expressions lut into the inouths of the speakers as occasionally coarse and vulgar the answer of mr ii ril es wvould be that they are the very language of such personages as lie has introduced  that thley are true to cliaracter that such men always so converse in society thus far this defence is valid  to what extent an author is bound to dress up his lialogucs in a shape lifferent from that which they vwould have worn in fact whether it is allowved to novelists

  overshadowed l the shorter poems of frederick tennyson macmillan and co it is probable that few people know the name of frederick tennyson save from the chance connexion of relationship to the great poet laureate for all that he was a poet of no mean ability who but for the eclipsing glory of his brother might conceivably have made a name conspicuous in the history of victorian literature he had unfortunately too retiring a disposition a nature too fond of abstract study and a soul that loved and sought for seclusion such ideals were hardly the right weapons for a fight necessary to make the dense understand the separate identities of his brother and himself and frederick tennyson never tried to do more than please his friends with the poems that were to him one of the easiest methods of expression with no wish for a public reputation the poet did not restrain himself sufficiently ever to get it in his constant use of capitals which to him doubtless conveyed an extra interpretation and significant reality in his vagueness and diffuseness of expression and the frequent antitheses he employed may be traced without especial difficulty the fondness for the abstract that can never make frederick tennyson really popular with any except those who look for poetry to convey to them something beyond a simple story with a moral or a motto and a sweet sense of emotional music frederick tennyson very often does tell a simple story and he very often uses exceedingly sweet lines but in general his style is very different examine a verse from a poem entitled the mountain so from the faroff mount of poesy the worlds great shows like the hushd champaign seem the actual insubstantiality real what is shaped in fancys eager eye fear love a hope a dream it is doubtful if any but real poets will appreciate this stanza with its harshness in places and abstractness of philosophical ideas but there are times when frederick can become as philosophical and as musical as browning take for example these two lines with all the great dreams that lie behind all the possibilities of eternity and all the conceptions that hover behind space climbing into the awful infinite those stairs whose steps are worlds very roughly indeed this is the main trend of ideas that run through this book for we must admit that frequently the theme is monotonous and the poet reiterates in a different manner what he has already expressed it must be understood however that though there are many faults of style and execution in the craft of the poetry yet in itself the poems are those which only one who had soared above the realms of minor poetry could have written,englishfiction_contra

can be permanent nor do we see any thing in the reasoning for parliamentary reform which is not derived from pure theory the fact appears to be this in the counties cities or towns where the property lies in one or two or very few rich per sons the members returned are com monly ministerial but in places where the property is much divided the refresentatives are mostly in opposition toperty will command influence and the augmentation of voters where the wealth of the place is in few hands would probably have no other than the present result and elsewhere surely no advantage would be gained by the other party if the electors for westminster were doubled or tripled as the influence of property cannot be destroyed but by military despotism we do not see what important change would ensue unless there were also changes in the state of the property men will vote according to their inte rests and the proprietor of old sarum whether the burgesses were ten or a hundred or a thousand if he owned the whole or a majority of them would return the member by means of such large proprietors the crown is alone enabled to maintain its proper weight in the constitution and as one ostensible pretence of parliamentary reform is to ease the people of taxation by diminish ing the national debt every advance in that project would more and more throw the great capitalists upon landed sroperty and augment the very inuence which it is the professed object of parliamentary reform to reduce in short we consider it purely in an impartial abstract view as a bubble and one which must ever be so unless froperty be previously subdivided our imits do not permit us to give other very cogent proofs that the idea is and must be of no other result and so far from ministers having advanced the in

fiction the queens tragedy by robert hugh benson pitman bs whatever else may be thought of father bensons latest historical novel no one will fail to find it fresh suggestive and interesting it keeps one asking is this true  was that wisely done  which was the right course in those circumstances such questionings mean that the book both holds attention and stimulates the mind to speak of the fiction as distinct from the history is really impossible for the two are interwoven like warp and woof so i address myself to the latter at once different as the judgments of protestants and catholics havecbeen about queen mary all agree that her reign closed in disappointment even before the worst had arrived father benson describes her feelings thus eighteen months ago she had been so happy the legate hd come with a splendour that promised great things england she thought had been restored to unity  her husband had been with her the babe had leapt in her wombthe dear babe that was to take up the government when she laid it down now it seemed as if all were a ghastly delusion the legate indeed still here but how powerless the heartshaking scene in westminster hall was no more than the rehearsing of a play that seemed postponed indefinitely her husband had disappeared into silence and the leap of the child was a thrill o a horrible disease    she had begun by hoping that    b restoring little by little the old worship the light of faith would be rekindled and her people had answered by attacking her priests mocking her religion and weaving sedition and heresy so inextricably together that it was impossible to punish the one without glorifying the other that is graphically as well as truly and sympathetically put in mary we see good intentions and mistaken policy tending to failure and failing while on the other side stands elizabeth worldly wise and unscrupulous knowing that she will win and winning in conclusion marys  star sets in gloom while the courtiers almost to a man slip away to worship the rising sun the main interest therefore and the chief problems are connected with mary but there is also a romantic element guy manton a cambridge master of arts is introduced an unconventional but interesting character whose development shows us what father benson thinks would have been the line taken during those troubles by one  of cathouc character he  is human of course and we see in him the degrading effect of the burnings having watched them he becomes aa he himself confesses a hard devil the obsession is admirably described with all the power of psychological and religious analysis in which father benson excels the narrative too here reaches a high degree of excellence man tons fidelity is put to a dramatic test and he wavers in the end however his better nature conquers but at was said before the true interest of the book lies in pure history and what of that history  to me it seems that in its main outlines it is unimpeachable the trials the successes and failures of the historical characters correspond with what actually took place for the rest the author has attained that degree of vrai semblance which is to be expected in a historical novel as we descend to details however we note the points at which differences of opinion will begin to assert themselves extremists will of course never be fully satisfied the admirers of foxe though they will find some things to their liking will not find enough believers in the inspiration of nicholas sander will not relish the way in which la ti mer and his confreres are praised  for as much as they did wisely enthusiasts for elizabeth and they are many will say that her portrait has been too darkly drawn but for my own part i think that a more notable error is one bearing hardly on queen mary as for elizabeth though no one would assert nowadays that se was truthful yet on the other hand no evidence is forthcoming to prove her such an unblushing hypocrite and traitor to her sister as she is here represented to have been this is true i think and yet father benson does not seem to me to have here exceeded the licence always allowed in a historical novel for as soon as he looked beyond marys reign and considered the contrast between elizabeths conduct before and after its terminationand perhaps pondered the wording of the coronation oath which she took in the hands of the old catholic prelates when she had fully decided on the measures for the overthrow of the old religionhe would feel fully justified in attributing to her as much as he has done of trickery and of faithlessness but however this may be i pass to a more important question is the mary tudor of this novel correct ly drawn from life  she is here a stupid woman conscious of her lack of wit and gaiety  unable to win love and affection and she is constantly losing herself in dreams her  mans voice  and prematurely aged appearance are insisted upon in and out of season i do not think that this is good portraiture it was perhaps tiue of her last days when the bloodletting and the other barbarities of contemporary leechcraft had brought her down to a shadow of her former self but this was not the woman who has made her mark on our history the dispatches of the ambassadors who came into actual contact with her show that she was active matteroffact well informed queenly and gifted with great insight into the men and matters that came under her notice it may be regretted that father bensons story concerns itself with the gloomy part of her reign exclusively even if otherwise faultless a picture so drawn is bound to be somewhat onesided of course there are also smaller points which might be discussed if space allowed he seems to me to be too hard upon philip too favourable to pole and to underestimate marys dislike of her halfsister which so good an authority as a venetian ambassador has called  hatred when elizabeths life was in the balance it was saved by philips intervention this would hardly fit in with some of fathers bensons most striking scenes whatever may be the objective truth about the points i have criticised it is clear first that they will not affect the the queens tragedyexcept in details which are nonessential and secondly that father benson has been so much on his guard against showing too much partiality for his coreligionists that when he does err it is generally to their disadvantage vuviau iv iuvii uiaauvauiac jh pollen sj  the queens tragedy  by robert hugh  benson sir isaac pitman  sons it is the novelist rather than the annalist who seems able to tell the truth about mary tudor that she was human and a woman is of service to her reputation as soon as we come close to her but proximity in this case can only be attained by imagination mr benson has not only come close to her  his mind has also glowed with sympathy for her she is in his pages a piteous woman the sport of extreme irony without peril to her devoutness and on her deathbed visited graciously by phantasmal children of heaven she is unintellectual she toils at embroidery  ridley and latimer are burnt and we see the candle lit that is not extinguished  yet for an hour or two we are loyal to mary because mr benson though no apologist is the voice of the pathos that is hers first love a passion for philip of spain in the breast of a woman of thirtyseven is tragedy in suspense from its commencement and the novelist makes her foolish heart flutter before us till we need the annalist to reduce the temperature of our pity there is no love story in the book except the queens instead of the usual fictitious wooing there is a deeply interesting study in manhood the subject being a fellow of cambridge who has left the university to become one of the queens gentlemen his aim is to be hard enough for his loyalty and the witnessing of torture he succeeds in spite of his tenderness for a friend in trouble a priest however is shrewd enough to divine that he is a man at wilful war with his own nature the writing at the end of the book is fine and grandiose  the queens tragedy by robert hugh benson 6s pitman one matter for congratulation is that mr benson has not made his new historical novel from the easy recipes that have been so popular of late years that they have grown tircsomelv conventional he has given us no lovely persecuted heroine and no dahinv and irresistible hero who is always arriving everywhere just in the nick of time to do something thrilling and saive the situation in a style that is admirably lucid and simple though one wvishes he would curb an inclination to colloquialism when one reads of people being horribly il horribly distressed or horribly startled i he teils the story of the dark and troubled reign of queen mlary as it was known to guy manton who served her alaestv as a gentleman usher he has drawn the pathetically unlovable character of mary clearly and with a very sympathetic insight and has woven the principal events of her life and the leading men of her age into a brilliant and fascinating romance that is the better and more intvresting fo being occasionally coloured ith something of partiality for her cause the closing sccne where the queen lies dying deserted and almost alone is a finrw inainecd and poignant piece of work alike for its characterisation

fallacy of ghosts dreams and omens with stories of witchcraft life in death and i monomania by charles ollier au thor of  ferrers c london 1848 ollier ti i s is the antipodes of mrs crow es night side of nature airs crowe approaches her subject with a conviction that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and with so much faith in spiritual appearances as amounts to an admission that  there is something in it and an endeavour to treat the matter philosophically mr oilier sets himself to the task with a predetermination to negative the conclusion and with intent to disprove the assertions of those whom he terms the credulous it must be admitted that mr oilier is clever and smart and if ghosts are to be written down his pen will do it he not only collects all the established arguments against the supposed communications of the spiritual with the material world but he puts them in the most telling shape and where argument is wanting he is prompt with fun which is perhaps even more effective with the general public who prefer the pleasure of a laugh to the labour of thought now there can be no doubt that very few ghoststories will bear close examination and the fact is undeniable that a ghost never a ppears to the sceptical and healthy even the instances collected by mrs crowe are not satisfactory it is impossible for a cautious man to accept the 6xistence of ghosts as a fact upon any evideace yet adduced we do not venture a step beyond this we cannot dogmatically assert our unbelief because no plausible reason is or can be assigned why there should not be communing between the world of spirit and the world of flesh on the contrary the presumption would be not only that it is possible but probable that is to say such will be the conclusion of those who admit the extence of spirit and acknowledge a future state the only question is if it has been estbiehed as a fact and to that we must reply in the words of the scotch verdict not proven it is otherwise with dreams second eight presentiments and such like of these there is abundant evidmce as matters of fact and the difficulty lies in accounting for them by any other means than reference to agency which is usually called supernatural but which would be more properly termed abnormal because it is not a violation of any natural law but the operation of an existing law that is called into action only in certain conditions of mind and body the attempts to explain away these prophetic promptings of the soul by the easy assertion that they are accidental coincidences will not bear a moments reflection such coincidences cannot be accidental according to any known calculation of probabilities there is infinity to one against them and they occur too often and with too many persons and under circumstances too remarkable to be answered by reference to chance but what is chance  nothing more than the result of laws which we have not taken into our calculation in truth there is no such thing as chance every event is the necessary consequence of certain fixed laws and might be predicated with certainty if we had the capacity to grasp and trace them if then the coincidences in question are the result of fixed laws have we a right to assume that there is no meaning in them that the author of nature i affixed to them no purpose and that we are to treat them with disregard and contempt would it not be more philosophical to investigate them carefully with intent to ascertain if the soul have not even while in this its tenement of clay the power under certain conditions of the body to which it is linked of communicating with the spirit world and of obtaining by a kind of intuition knowledge which cannot be procured through the circumscribed media of the bodily senses and that this knowledge it is but how obtained we cannot tell which we term presentiment second sight dreams and which it perplexes us to account for because we have no memory of the circumstances under which it was obtained  it appears to us that this is the philosophical view of the question which has occupied so many pens pro and con and in this manner we should like to have seen it treated by mr ollier who has skill in writing to make philosophy popular we note as an instance of the sort of grtuitous assumption with which mr oilier has sought to explain away facts his account of the murder at dundry which was discovered by too persons having dreamed on the same night that the body was deposited in a certain well and mr oilier assumes that there can be little doubt that the general opinion among the deceaseds servants wvas that their master was murdered now this is a pure supposition and the fact was otherwise we were present at the trial and made very particular inquiry into the circumstances from the witnesses and the truth was that up to the time of finding the body in the well at the earnest entreaty of the men who had dreamed that it was concealed there not the slightest suspicion of murder had been entertained by any person in the family or out of it it was supposed that the farmer had either killed himself or died in a fit therefore it was that nobody thought it worth while to examine a dry well covered by a huge stone which it required two men to lift hence there was not in the minds of the dreamers anything that could have led their sleeping thoughts to the well besides if they had suspected murder why did not the well suggest itself to their waking thoughts when actually on the premises searching and it was before their eyes  it is at least an extraordinary fact that two persons should have chanced to have the same dream in itself a marvellous accident on the same night such combinations of accident would be more wonderful than the fact itself and more hard to believe than the explanation which we confess presents itself to our mind i as that which is the rationale of this and all  other revelations of the same kind namely that the state of mind and body which in mesmerism calls forth that faculty of perception beyond the range of the senses which we term clairvoyance exists also in certain other states of body and mind that one of the conditions under which this species of perception occurs is thati the attention should be intensely fixed upon the object that in the case under consideration there was the condition of attention fixed upon the object namely the missing farmer that in sleep the state of mind and body occurred wvhich permits of perception by other than the media of the bodily senses and then the object vas perceived by the sleepers and remembered by them as a dream it is a phenomenon every day witnessed in persons in a state of mesmerism and there is no reason why the faculty should not be developed in other states wve have little doubt indeed that when the subject comes to be investigated by a series of close observations it will be found that this faculty which is called clairvoyanee is possessed by nal of us but developed only in certain states of mind or body more frequently however than we at present ha ve any suspicion of we are not sure that many of the thoughts and much of the knowledge we possess is not obtained by means of this facultynay we are inclined to believe that all of that mysterious intelligence which we term instinct is to be traced to the same source but this is too large a subject to enter upon here for the present we close mr olliers book having derived from it much amusement and with a hope that lie will be induced to look more profoundly into the subject and employ his great abilities to its elucidation rather than to an endeavour to laugh it down the papers collected in this volume originally appeared in ainsworths m1agazine and that will account for their somewhat gossiping tone,englishfiction_contra

1 the magic of kindness  or the wondrous story9 of the good huan by the brothers mayhew illustrated by george cruikshank and kenny meadows durton and co this is a tale of wonders every word of which is literally true at once to seize the delighted attention of youth and to leave on its dispositions a healthy kiudly and strong impression is or ought to be the aim of all writers for children the story of the good huan has this great merit it is meaut to expand the imagination while it elevates and harmonises the temper the subject matter of the tale is how a great king had a son and prevailed upon a healthy peasant to nurse him neglecting her own child how the young prince grew strong and an admired hero and the young peasant dwindled into a despised cripple how the spirit of revenge converted though cripple into a terrible giant who drank of the cup of revenge till the dregs grew bitter in his mouth  how the spirit of kindness made the giant a dwarf and endowed him with a wondrous power of conciliating love aud obedience and how this dwarf engaged in a mission of charity and gentleness and became finally a martyr and more powerful to inculcate his principles through martyrdom the gallant but at first callous prince with his dumb gentle sister iluan whether as cripple or fierce giant or dwarf strong in love and intellect  with the frail sister whom he loves and all the varied characters the thread of whose destiny is interwoven with theirs are presented to us in the gorgeous colours and imposing forms of an eastern tale but a higher life is breathed into them by the spirit of the homely english moral that at the same time pervades the story the only thing we could havo wished omitted by the author i3 the prefatory enumeration cf authorities for the leading incidents and though corresponding references in the notes children will feel them in the way we have to add that the inculcation of the pacific doctrine is carried to the ultraextrerao but to this we can hardly object the natural pugnacious tendencies are so inveterate that the young human sapling may safely be allowed a very considerable bend the other way we have ourselves we must frankly confess little faith in though efficacy of passive submission to aggression when the fierce mastiff ran openmouthed at the poor haymaker the frightened rustic laid it dead at his feet with his pitchfork but the dog was a favourite with his owner as quarrelsome two legged curs are with nations and horrible were the invectives that assailed though wielder of the pitchfork stripped of those ornaments however the brief dialogue was instructive  why did you kill the dog   because it was going to bite and tear me  could you not have driven him off with the other end of though pitchfork   so i would master if he had run at me with his tail we cannot give a more favourable specimen of the story before us than by quoting the scene of huan s martyrdom he perishes for refusing to sanction an unjust war but his death is only the consummate accomplishment of all the divine objects of his life but the people still looked upon huan as one beloved by god and feared to draw the sword unless he blessed the banners they were to fight under so aleph sought out huan in his dungeon and spake kindly to him promising him his liberty if he would but consecrate the banners of the troops bufc the dwarf answered  ye have set the olivebranch upon them and made the symbol of peace the emblem of war verily to implore a blessing on the one is to invoke a curse upon the other presently newg was brought to the city that the enemy were within a few days march of asulon and the citizens grew alarmed aud again cried aloud for the blessing of the dwarf then aleph knowing the superstition of the multitude feared to lead the people on without kuans benizon so he gathered together his troops and summoning the dwarf from his dungeon bade him in the presence of the assembled army invoke a blessing on the bannersthreatening him with death if he withheld it but huan asked the royal youth by what form of words he should call upon the compassionate the merciful to pour down his grace upon the banners of death  or by what blasphemy he should invoke the spirit of kindness to bless and make holy the flag of slaughter  now when aleph heard the rebuke he shook with anger and the army grew furious crying  away with him to the lions den  away with bim  then the unresisting huan was seized and dragged to the valley beyond though city walls and while some set a rude barrier round about the meadow others hurried to bring the cage of the roaring monster and when they had dragged it thither they placed it io the centre of the field as the hungry beast paced restlessly up and down its den and i made the hills rattle with its roar authy led on by voe threw j herself at alephs feet and besought him by the love he said he bore i her that he would spare her brother er oe too pointing to alephs empty sleeve silently reminded him how huan and the blind girl had saved him from the jaws of death but the young warrior could not forget that his father for the love of him they pleaded for had disinherited him of the throne aud he hated the dwarf not only for having forestalled him of the crown but for the craven principles he taught even whilst an armed enemy was marching to lay waste their city yet in pity for the blind girl who still clung to his feet iwseeching his mercy he aaked the dwarf a third time whether he would bless the banners for the third time huan refused saying he was the minister of kindness and aleph crimson with passion at the mans stubbornness cried  cast him in  let us see how this kindness will avail him with raging lions   then huan was thrust within the arena and the savage monster let loose upon him while the crowd climbed the neighbouring hills and stood breathiest with suspense as they gazed down upon the plain the huge lion sprang from his den and bounded towards huan who stood rapt in prayer but no sooner was the eye of the creature fixed upon the dwarf than the blackmaned beast crouched at his feet and as it rolled on itt back turned up its white stomach to he fondled by bim then huan recognised in the grateful brute the creature whom he had freed of the thorn and as he placed his foot upon the hons side it rolled backwards and

norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be paralleled in any other country still we cannot forbear giving a short account of it were it only for the purpose of showing that an entertaining book  may be produced without having recourse to those sensational horrors which seem to be the fountainheads of so much of the threevolume literature of our own country j from two families in the village of norwood spring the hero and heroine of the tale barton cathcart is

doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much disturbance and considered that  a

while walking obliged him to become an inmate of cathcarts house so as to strengthen this feeling he recovers slowly and returns to his virginian home these scenes of peaceful village life are rudely

  new novels the god of clay by h c bailey hutchinson  co mr baileys new book by reason of its subject and its allotment into consecutive chapters ranks we suppose as a novel yet it is hardly that being an episodic resume of napoleons career as visualised by the imagination the thread of interest remains in the person of bonaparte who connects the tales the authors writing is forceful but he is still too abrupt and spasmodic a trick that came in with mr kipling fortiter in re characterises him but not suaviter in modo his writing is at times brilliant and he manages to carry you along with him however reluctant you may be you want to protest to point out that this thing could not have happened to demur to that astounding assumption to plead that he has not adequately explained that the puzzle remains that women do not do these things half a score of objections you would like to raise  but you have no time mr bailey rushes you along and never heeds and since you are genuinely interested in his narratives you give up and follow humbly out of a mass of incredible events and incidents which mr bailey does not even condescend to explain emerges nevertheless a vivid and powerful and faithful portrait of napoleon the form of this work we imagine was dictated by serial necessities which have hampered the author but the matter proves as we have pointed out before that he is in the forefront of our historical novelists,englishfiction_contra

one against the world or reubens war a novel by john saunders 3 vols tinsley brothers the interest of this story does not depend on hairbreadth escapes trapdoors disguises personations and surprises now so much in favour with novelwriters the interest springs from a much deeper source it turns upon the vital fact that every deed done in a mans life bears its own fruit and brings its own consequence whether it has remained in secret or become known to the world the story is romantic and it is well told reuben or  gent rube as he is called is we regret to say a thief a burglar of great skill in his profession engaged in the opening of the tale with a companion in the same line of business in a plan to break into the house of squire gorman and to carry off his plate the companion is

seem casual wayfarers and strangers to each other at a wayside publichouse whilst they are biding their time until squire germans dishonest footman shall convey the appointed signal that all is ready a ponycarriage containing two ladies and a servant boy calls at the little inn the vision of the young lady brings all reubens good aspirations to a crisis he falls desperately in love with her at first sight and looks upon her as a good catholic would regard a saint or guardian angel if one appeared pointing the way to heaven the ladies depart and so does reubens comrade reuben feels some missvings at the coincidence and follows to help em in case of need he arrives almost too late for he finds the ladies in deadly terror they have been robbed of all their valuables ana their unfortunate servant has been half killed by a man whom reuben from their description recognises as his companion he had made off on hearing some one approach reuben has the satisfaction of convoying the ladies home and calming their fears reuben resolves that the one burglary to which he stands pledged shall be his very last and that henceforth he will be an honest man the burglary at squire germans is successfully committed though the robbers have a narrow escape owing to the treachery of the footman their accomplice but they do escape and with a fabulous amount of booty reuben surrenders the whole of his share on condition of receiving the articles which had been stolen from the ladies and the promise of his companion never to claim his acquaintance he then formally takes leave of the  cross purposing henceforth to live entirely  on the square reuben naturally gravitates to the house of the ladies whom he has assisted in their distress  to restore their property is the excuse he makes to himself the ladies receive him with a confiding welcome which speaks more for their gratitude than their discretion they instal him into their spare room and as it is saturday night they insist upon his remaining over sunday ail reubens good resolutions grow with the strength and rapidity of jacks beanstalk he charms not only the young lady but her mother also by his good looks pleasant manners and agreeable conversation he sings too with a wonderful rich voicesongs from norma and other operas reuben is a thief of genius but he haa lived all his life with flash company and it remains wonderful that he should be able to pass muster as a guest to be domesticated by two unprotected women the result is however fortunate for them nobby bob reubens partner instead of leaving the neighbourhood makes an attempt to break into the house believing the ladies to be rich and their house defenceless little dreaming that reuben is their guest reuben of course knows exactly what ought to be done in the emergency and he does it it is a novel position for him but he is quite equal to the occasion when he finds the intruder to be his old master and late partner reuben has a moment of deadly temptation but he resists it and shows a good and generous nature his old companion will not profit by it he tries to kill reuben and there is a struggle in which reuben is hurt and his adversary receives a wound of which he dies which is a piece of great luck for reuben as it relieves him of a dangerous enemy and starts him with great eclat on the road of honesty but the past cannot be severed from the present at every turn he is met and baffled by some accident arising from his old life he keeps up a manful fight against all his difficulties he has friends in the maxwells and in a worthy old doctor who is their friend and the guardian of miss maxwell reuben shows many excellent qualities in fact he is so truthful and straightforward that it is difficult to understand how he had ever prospered in his old career of thief and rogue he however mars many of his chances by impatience at the last moment which destroys the good of all he had done and suffered but though often defeated in his efforts to earn an honest living he never relapses into bad courses having enlisted as a soldier he does his duty well but an experienced thief has by ill luck enlisted in the same regiment his thefts are laid to the charge of reuben and though he is cleared from them the malignity of his comrade reveals the secret of his previous life the tyranny of his superior officer finishes what thisrevelation had begun reubens temper fails he returns a blow which his officer had given with a cane this grave offence he aggravates by an unsuccessful attempt to escape from arrest things would have gone very hardly but for a romantic discovery of his parentage  as it is he nearly frustrates all attempts to befriend him but in the end his sentence is commuted to four years penal servitude and he is to be sent out ofthe country his friends new and old stand by him at the last and the book ends with the promise of miss maxwell to join him as soon as his sentence will permit and become his wife beginning with him a new life in a new world as reuben is still very young there is a fair prospect of years before him in the main subject of the story in the discovery of his father and in the final destiny of the hero the reader will be reminded of sir bulwer lyttons paul clifford the management of the story is however altogether different from that novel but in both cases we would warn romantic readers against expecting to find reuben poleworthy and paul clifford in the general run of even penitent thieves,englishfiction_contra
ginxs baby his birth and other misfortunes our library table strahan  co the author of  ginxs baby has wished to give good advice for the moral maladies under which society labours and he has enveloped it in a kind of jocosity which as often happens in the case of medicines for children is little fess distasteful than that which it is intended to sweeten moreover the comic element is so awkwardly mingled with the serious that its purpose is betrayed at once and we are repelled instead of attracted the story if we may so call it which serves as sweetening to the preaching is as follows  ginxa less grotesque name would have served the authors purpose equally well it is not funnyis a navvy and the baby is his thirteenth child on the birth of the twelfth ginx had vowed to drown the next and proceeds in due course to carry out his vow he is met as he goes to vauxhall bridge by various people among them a philosopher which gives the opportunity for a lecture on malthusianisma subject quite proper in its due place but liable to become improper if treated jocosely the baby is ultimately rescued by a man who takes him to a convent of course the nuns and their confessor have names which are meant to be funny but only succeed in being foolish from the convent he is taken by the protestant association and we have a little chaff of exeter hall and ito proceedings but we will not pursue ginxs baby through his varying career suffice it to say that after being exposed several times in the streets taken to workhouses and rejected by them he at last is adopted by the reform club becomes a page bolts with the spoons and ends by the very fate from which he had been rescued in infancy for he drowns himself from vauxhall bridge we are left somewhat in doubt aa to the panacea which the author himself would recommend for our social ailments  it is either a scheme of emigration or an alteration in the law so as to enable parents to drown their superfluous children from the general tone of the book we should say he means to suggest the former course but on the other hand a remark at the end of the book together with the catastrophe itself incline us to decide for the other we see all rights are reserved including we presume that of dramatising the story now if we may be allowed to advise this is what the author should do let him recast it in a dramatic form leaving out most of the moral part and introducing an immoral part let us say a byplot of an intrigue between sir charles sterling and sister something in the convent get one or two set scenes of vauxhall bridge by moonlight and such like and send it to the theatre if it does not in that form draw crowded houses for six monthswell we shall have our opinion of the modern taste in dramatic matters enormously increased  inxs baby his birth and other misfortunes strahan and co i london 1870 what a london navvy earning eighteen shillings a week ought to find society prepared to do with his thirteenth baby is a question easier asked than answered the historian of the son of ginx is rather severe upon the philosopher the police force the charitable agencies the parish authorities and the club politicians who somehow fail to make life pleasant to his hero  yet they do more for him than for the twelve brothers and sisters who were never threatened with drowning and are guiltless so far as the author explains of any sins of commission which should leave the infant like douglas jerrolds st giles no choice but to grow up in criminal habits to begin at the beginning a wandering malthusian suggests that on the whole ginxs baby had better not have been born he is suppressed by public opinion with a confused sense that the domestic virtues of ginxpadre and mere are on the whole beneficial to the community a relieving officer quotes not wholly unreasonable acts of parliament which constrain the reluctant father to maintain not drown his superfluous offspring the nuns who take the infant in hand next decline on reflection to provide for his body unless they may work their will on his soul a tedious satire on the  protestant detectc al association  is meant to show that charitable organisations have gaps through which any number of units may slip unseen to distress then it is the turn of the poor law guardians who seize the first opportunity of returning ginxs baby on the hands of ginx who deposits it on the threshold of a club in pall mall and emigrates here the authors case begins to break down the club adopts ginxs baby it is fed and clothed and moralised about till it is fifteen and if it is also petted and snubbed by turns that fate is not peculiar to foundlings that it should elope with some spoons instead of donning the livery of one of its patrons and finally commit suicide because it hadnt been murdered in infancy is mere matter of temperament whilst social satire is supposed to deal with types the author of ginxs baly feels strongly on some very important questions and has a fund of righteous indignation at the disposal of those who answer them amiss but his criticism would be fairer if hie did not try to cut up every body in a breath and especially if he would pass by the too obvious occasions for smart writing afforded by newspaper grievances h lawrenny,englishfiction_contra

the new humptydumpty by daniel chaucer lane 6s miss di pradella explained how you were taught to do the splits you stood upon two chairs and they were gradually drawn apart there is only one serious novelist whose mind is stored with such weighty secrets of the musichall as this this phrase a respectful reference to the empire ballet a savage contempt fortradespeople and familiar conversation concerning the forms of the roman catholic and the greek churches betray the identity of daniel chaucer the new humptydumpty in its fine detail and lucid statement of complex adventure is another stage in the development of a genius that is struggling from a youth spent in the subtlest impressionism to the most literal realism of treatment from the fifth queen to the panel in fact yet again it is an echo born the past when joseph conrad collaborated with another to write romance there was in that the same manly combat with fortune the same adoration for the noble highwayman but this is touched with the virtues of experience there is a fine mastery over events in the story of the splendid count sergius mihailovitch macdonald who for his ideal of benevolent despotism moves a counterrevolution in the republic of galizia and sets on the throne the boyking who would like to be a chauffeur and who having served his ideal is shot down on the night of victory because he once refused to admire the poetry of the elder dumas there is a new power in the gnomelike figure of the wretched little mr pett the socialist turned nietzschean tory and a wilder humour about the merry and disreputable miss di pradella with her passion for embroidered pillowslips of course daniel chaucer is always very childlike and one of the habits of childhood is to chuckle over jokes that it cannot explain so the savage satire with which he cudgels countess macdonald a horrible picture of what a wicked fabian would be like is sometimes incomprehensible the same combination of wit and obscurity that made one feel the force of the satire one was not permitted to understand was observable in high germany but the book as a whole is a complete reaction against daniel chaucers earlier manner one can remember the time when daniel chaucer committed the sin of henry james in every supersubtle sentence but that influence has gone the last pages which contain mrs petts description of the death of sergius mihailovitch belong to the manner of joseph conrad the weathercock veers to many winds but it is always the same weathercock and the individuality of daniel chaucer is always precious whatever wind it follows  the new humptydumpty by daniel chaucer 6s john lane the new humptydumpty is the young king of galizia whose people have rebelled set up a republic and made it necessary for him and his mean pompous old mother to escape out of it they settle down in england very much as a certain real king and his household are settled in exile amongst us at this time and presently a little group of plotters is gathered about them scheming and intriguing to replace the dispossessed monarch on his throne it is an amazing group including an american millionaire an english lady and his lordship her dissipated husband a fatuous chauffeur a lightcomedy actress a lady of lighter reputation still a bumptious cockney journalist and for leader of them all the russian count macdonalda wholly likeable and charming character the one utter idealist and fine spirit in the sordid selfsceking shoddy company the american millionaire helps to finance the adventure with a couple of millions on the understanding that he receives valuable mining concessions the english lady aldington and her husband contribute to the treasury because they own profitable tin mines in the country that the republic is governing the count who under the tuition of the egregious cockney journalist mr pett has been an anarchist and a socialist and squandered his fortune for the good of those causes has now taken up the kings cause on pure idealistic grounds and for no possible good to himself incidentally he is hampered with a very jealous wife the daughter of a london shopkeeper a girl he had married in his socialistic days he is further hampered by the american millionaires sentimental daughter falling in love with him and by falling in love himself with the unhappily married lady aldington wnrhich opens the door to some biting satire on our divorce laws as the whole story opens it to a satiric handling of modern methods of company promotion and to an ironic presentation of the grotesque realities that underlie the outward glory and dignity of kingship the characterisation is masterly and the satire of the book especially when it is concerned with the futile personality of the exiled king or that of a certain degenerate russian grand duke or that of the great little mr pett cuts home but it is all done with so light and whimsical a touch that even when it is most biting it is irresistibly amusing there is nothing cleverer or more entertaining among the new novels than this witty and brilliant story of how all the kings financiers and motley hangerson and that one delightful idealist went to work to put humpty dumpty together again  the new hmnptydumpty fiction by daniel chaucer john lane 6s  mr daniel chaucers work has the quality of a really good champagne it exhilarates and the general effect is that of a slight but quite pleasant intoxication no novelist eludes classification so successfully other writers are grave and gay in turns but mr chaucer is grave and gay at the same time he is at once a keen observer of contemporary movements a social satirist an explorer into the strange realms of phantasy and a purveyor of honest entertainment his style is marked by a distinction that lifts it to a very high level and his dialogue is a feast of delights one may perhaps take mr chaucer halfseriouy for it seems to us that it would be as great a mistake to see too little in his story as to see too much he chronicles with a certain eager avidity the lives of wellbred people of dissolute habits for the crankconsidered purely as a typehe has a special fondness and the study of mr pett the theoretic socialist is inimitably perfect the story is concerned with a counterrevolution in the kingdom of galizia the king is living in exile a republic has been established the kinga mere boyhas acquired a little unfairly a reputation for a certain not very reprehensible licentiousness he is believed to be fond of actresses but he has friends and thesefor various reasonsare anxious to see him reestablished on the throne of his ancestors the financial aid of an american syndicate is invoked and thus the quite perfect mr dexter with his tufthunting daughter are introduced for the delight of the reader but the dominating figure of the narrative is sergius mihailovitch macdonald round whom the other characters revolve like stars in the planetary system macdonald is indeed mr chaucers supreme achievement in portraiture and the curious passion of the count for lady aldington provides a love interest which is less

trevlyn hold or squire trtvlyrcs heir new novels bythe author of  east lynne 3 vols tinsley brotherstrevlyn hold is more interesting and less melodramatio than most of mrs woods later works there is nothing startling about it not even a ghost she has succeeded in working out a good story full of action and plot without the aid of any very gross crime there is not a single murder worthy of the name not a robbery commonly so called not a forgery not a divorce case and only a very mild commonplace trial before a few county magistrates and yet strange to say in spite of this forbearance mrs woods new novel is more exciting than any she has produced since her first success in east lynne this is partly owing to her having refrained for once from imparting to her readers any lessons in teetotalism or political economy so that the story runs its course uninterruptedly and is full of interest from beginning to end another marked improvement in trevlyn hold is that there is more delicacy of touch in the delineation of the characters more light and shade than is usual with this author there aresome good points to be found even in members of the unpopular family and we are led to suppose that some of the persecuted race are liable to occasional failings of temper which render them infinitely more lifelike and true to nature than her heroes usually are mrs wood true to herself however is far from neglecting her favourite theory of retribution villany she believes brings its own reward even in this world innocence is sure to triumph sooner or later whether this is always the case in real life we do not feel so confident but in the world of fiction where the author has an unlimited power of bestowing rewards and punishments it would be hard if the wicked were to go scatbless and if the virtuous failed to obtain their rights at the end of the third volume the story of  squire trevlyns heir is as follows the old squire dies leaving one single daughter and two married daughters to succeed to his estates of his two sons one has run away in early youth and is supposed to have died abroad the other always a delicate invalid has died of consumption also abroad leaving a wife and an infant daughter but the squire never knows for it is fraudulently kept from him that joes widow has given birth to a posthumous son who should of course be heir to trevlyn hold the squire is a passionate vindictive old gentleman and tyrannical withal he is angry with his eldest daughter for having married tom ryle the gentleman farmer and he is angry with his son joe for having married the clergymans daughter and it is not difficult to persuade him to leave his property which is not entailed to the other married daughter mrs james chattaway and her children james chattaway has for years established himself at  the hold as confidential adviser and manager of the estates and by persuading or bribing the unmarried daughter to aid him in keeping the secret mr chattaway succeeds in concealing the birth of joes son and securing the inheritance for himself after his own sons rupert and joseph the squire accordingly bequeaths the hold to his second daughter mrs chattawaythus cutting off all hope for though children of his son joe and of his eldest daughter mrs ryle at the time the story opens james chattaway has been for born years in possession of trevlyn hold and his son cris lords it over his cousins bravely as the young squire should do mrs kyle is bitterly aggrieved that her son trevlyn kyle is deprived of his lawful rights and the neighbours generally regard the chattaways as usurpers and interlopers and feel convinced that rupert trevlyn poor joes orphan boy should be if all had their rights the master of trevlyn hold mr chattaway has received into his family joes children for their widowed mother is also dead and a pleasant life rupert and maud trevlyn have of it there mrs chattaway a weakminded helpless woraau does her best for them but she is as much afraid of her husband as they are and she can do but little to help them maud is made governess to the younger chattaways and rupert is honoured with the office of clerk at some mining works on the estate cris and octave chattaway taking good care meanwhile that they shall not be spoilt by any foolish overindulgence from softhearted mrs chattaway aunt diana tbe unmarried miss trevlyn who also resides at the holl is anxious that no gross injustice or cruelty should be perpetrated and so far as she is concerned administers justice to all her nephews and nieces with an even hand the hero of the tale is george ryle mrs ryles stepson a thoroughly upright conscientious young man who with the most unselfish motives manages trevlyn farm for his stepmother and halfbrother pays off all chittaways unjust claims upon them and is ready to retire in his brothers favour the moment he is required to do so of course george ryle falls in love with maud trevlyn and though persecuted with attentions from octave chattaway never swerves from his allegiance to the oppressed governess and equally of course is handsomely rewarded at last rupert trevlyn is however the bestdeveloped character in the book and in his wrongs and sufferings the interest chiefly centres worn out by a long train of daily insults from his uncle and cousins and stung to madness by a horsewhipping unjustly administered for some trifling offence rupert seizing a burning torch plunges it into a hayrick which stands temptingly close at hand and thereby ruins all his hopes of any mercy from the avaricious chattawaywe will not here relate the end of the story for it would forestall the pleasure of reading the book itself assurance may be given that though cruel chattaways are defeated in the most surprising and unexpected manner and that  the hold  becomes the property of its rightful owner all in good time there are some very welldepicted scenes scattered about the three volumes the accident at the mine and the burning of the ricky ard the death of farmer ryle and the advent of the mysterious stranger with the red umbrella are all excellent some of the characters too are original and well contrasted one with the other gentle mrs chattaway and her strongminded bisters airs ryle and diana trevlyn are good so are nora the bustling housekeeper at the farm and ann canham the weakeyed but worthy charwoman at the lodge take it all in all  trevlyn hold is a successful novel and will be more popular than many of its predecessors though perhaps it is not up to the standard of east lynne which seems to be still the work of this prolific author,englishfiction_contra
