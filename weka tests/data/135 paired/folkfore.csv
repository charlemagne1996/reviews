the story of the plebiscite t story of the plebiscite  told by one of the seven million jive hundred thousand who voted fes from the french of mm erckmanncbatrian smith elder and co this latest production of mm erckmannchatrian is founded on the francogerman war of 187071 and may be the first of a series of fictions on that theme and similar to those its authors have written on the french wars in the beginning of the century it is a history of the recent war written from the point of view of a welltodo inhabitant of a village lying between alsace and lorraine and gives a vivid and truthful picture of the condition and sentiments of the french peasantry during the continuance of the struggle although as a work of art this novel is not inferior to any of the previous war stories of mm erckmannchatrian it is not likely to acquire an equal degree of popularity either in this country or in france its authors have in a large measure been forestalled by the newspaper correspondents so much indeed has been written on this war that the public interest in it has for a time at least been surfeited  and there are no incidents in the novel of a sufficiently striking kind to excite an appetite that has so recently been gorged with authentic descriptions of ali the horrors heroisms terrors and excitements attendant on a successful invasion  the story of the plebiscite will in all probability be considered tame and wearisome far too much space is occupied with accounts of the movements of the armies and with rumours of all sorts which are generally proved to be false almost as soon as they are reported  but this portion of the work is doubtless a faithful representation of the state of mind of the french peasantry throughout the campaign christian weber the narrator of the story is mayor and miller of rothalp in dosenheim when the war breaks out having inherited the mill from his grandfather and been a frugal prudent man christian has scraped together an independence for life and what with his official dignity and the honour reflected on him from his relationship with a match manufacturer of paris who married a rich innkeepers widow and settled in the village he is regarded with universal respect and reverence by his fellowvillagers aad is of course not a little proud of his position whenever he speaks we are assured by himself all honest men respond  thats the truth thats the opinion of monsieur le maire this worthy man has not undertaken to write a history of the war without having an object in view he wishes to show in general how many evilminded people there are in the world and in particular now the inhabitants of rothalp were deceived after the most abominable fashion by the sousprefets the prefets tthlnisters e cunsand the official gazettes  and he alfie same time unconsciously discloses the ignorant selfishness that rendered himself and the rurals of france eisy victims of deception receiving orders from the sousprefet to give public notice of the plebiscite and to request all welldisposed persons to vote yes if they desired o preserve peace because all though ruffians in the country com6 lngto voteato to have war the mayor instantly plies with simple unsuspecting alacrity and zeal rekr owever are the notices issued than his rich v ponly denounces the emperor ministers prefets chrif d bishops for seeking to delude the people and 9tlan weber would certainly have quarrelled with his intertrcusm and ordered bis arrest had not selfwhat tated constraint and toleration  christian contr r 0u thinkin8 of says the mayors wife  to do it v0uf cousin  such a rich  and who n so much good byandby  remember that his wife has relations and she will want to get everything on her side these arguments prevail over the worthy official and he inwardly resolves never to contradict george far less imprison him for  he might himself alone be worth to us far more than the emperor the ministers the senators and all the establishment together gradually cousin georges arguments and wealth prevail over the mayor and ultimately he resigns the post of which he had been so vain and abuses our honest manthe emperoras heartily though not with quite so much pungency as his relative during the whole course of the war no very extra ordinary event occurs to the weber family the prussian spies who had been prospecting the district for about a year before the war began having formed a high estimate of the millers means the requisitions levied upon him are heavy in these emergencies christian takes counsel with his shrewd relative who advises him to furnish the supplies demanded quietly for he reasons  if we make grimaces while we pay they will ask more  and if we go to work without much grumbling they will shave us not quite so close they will pretend to treat us with consideration and indulgence  they wont rob quite so roughly they will be a little more gentle and strip us with more civility when the duke of saxemeiningen and his aidesdecamp and servants take up their abode with the mayor the old mans vanity is rudely shocked at their treatment of him  they laughed they chatted

everything turns out tolerably well for the webers in the end the miller recovers the old chest containing four thousand livres that he had hid under the millstream his son jacob returns safe and sound from the war and gredels lover becomes a partner in the rich relatives business and thus removes all obstacles to his marriage with the only daughter of the house of weber having thus reorganised his family christian weber closes his history by expressing a determination to  try to regain by labour economy and good conduct what bonaparte lost for us by the plebiscite the character of the mayor is well sustained throughout and he is a representative of a large section of french rural society but the novel is as we have already stated commonplace in its elements and somewhat monotonous,folklore_contra

  the hunchback of westminster by william le queux methuen  co to novelreaders who require their fiction to be sensational who expect a thrill of excitement with every chapter the hunchback of westminster may be recommended most heartily mr le queux in writing his latest tale of adventure would seem to have been moved by a desire to ascertain how many exciting incidents he is capable of crowding into three hundred pages the exact measure of his success may be left to persons more statistically inclined than the present reviewer to discover it is sufficient for him to express the belief that the most exacting reader of sensational fiction will find his requirements most lavishly provided for in the hunchback of westminster every chapter of which is calculated to create a feverisn desire to hasten to the next this wealth of incident is the outcome of a search for certain old manuscripts which are known by a select circle of competitors to contain a clue to the locality of the sacred lake of tangikano where eious mexicans are supposed to have uried treasure  worth several millions of pounds the central figure of the story is a  secret investigator who is employed by a secret society to get possession of these precious documents and who in his reckless devotion to his clients interests performs the most extraordinary feats on a perilous voyage in an airship mystery murder robbery impersonation love the hunchback of westminster lacks scarcely one of the elements of the popular novel even for those to whom melodrama is merely a form of burlesque it is not without its merits,folklore_contra

the cavaliers of virginia or the recluse of jamestown an llisto rica ilomance 3 vols a very good work and deserving notice the plot is wellconceived and embraces many stirring and grand incidents the time of action is laid precisely at that period when the accession of the second charles of england gave the cavalier party in that country and her colonies the great supremacy which in general they used so insolently the story briefly runs thus a brian oreilly with a little boy on his back that he had just saved with himself from shipwreck finds protection for both in the mansion of a mr fairfax a strange name for a cavalier and this boy proves to bc the hero of the story he is brought up with virginia the heroine and daughter of the benefactor when nathaniel liacoti the least heroic of names comes to mans estate he finds himself in love with his fostersister macon though he wishes to go the whole hog with the lady is no beggar private and very ample remittances having been from time to time forwarded to mr fairfax for the expenses of his education and finally for the purchase for him of one of the best plantations in the province now in the vicinity of these good folks there resides one of a character not altogether so unexceptionable but much more romantic  one vast gigantic regicide recluse colonel whalley thc actual husband of mrs fairfax the mother of virginia and as he him elf supposes the father of nat bacon this whalley was long sup posed to have been shot as he deserved and it was only till after this was supposed to be ascertained that mrs fairfax remarried now thc then governor of virginia was a peppery hotheaded addledbrained ultracavalier named sir william berkeley with a reprobate nephew called beverley his heir and successor virginia is an heiress and it is the arrogant governors pleasure that she shall marry his heir bacon puts in his caveat this is the state of affairs when the roundheads rise and endeavour to blow up the governor in his statehouse bacon saves the town from destruction and proves that he has other qualities besides that of  sighing at his mistress s elbow9 to be entitled a hero he gets dreadfully wounded for his pains but thinks himself well rewarded as it is the means of gaining the plighted faith of the lady we cannot even name all the intervening and attendant incidents arising from this position of affairs the reader must suppose a duel a metre with the indians and the introduction of an indian princess with a whampum belt and mocassins all very effective but which has but little to do with the course of the story except in so far as it introduces an opportunity of getting the hero to the stake and his body systematically planted all over with pine splinters preparatory to a roast but the historical and political events are thc most extraordinary for some reasons utterly unreasonable to everybody but the prejudiced old governor he allows the indian tribes to confederate and make head unmolested on the frontiers of his province at length they openly rise and ravage the country with all the ingenious ferocity of the indian the day before wyanokee formerly the servant of virginia now the head of the tribe had saved her bacon from roasting by using the red womans privilege of making him her husband and the day after these espousals without consummation we find the bridegroom in spite of himself proclaimed the general of the army of the colonists to resist the indian invasion and avenge its cruelties we think that here the fiction and the fact are improbably blended though the act of the colonists was necessary to the safety of the state indeed to its very existence the old governor stigmatised it as a rebellion calls in all the regular troops from the outposts on the extreme points of his government intending to fall upon the delivering army in the rear whilst the indian is in the front well out he marches from the capital with this commendable intention when the citizens whom he had left behind thinking this a queer way to save the country march out in the shape of another army to do battle on the governor so there are four armies going to fight each other in a line in the meantime bacon is too active isle annihilates the indian army in his front before the governor has time to attack him in the rear the old man then falls back upon the army at his tail not to right with it but to make all manner of treacherous concessions among which is that of granting regular commissions to general bacon and his officers once again in his capital he attempts to tyrannise as usual but the liberal party is too strong for him and he removes with the ships and the troops that are faithful to him to the town of acomac in the meantime bacon having impolitically left his army to reach the capital the sooner is taken in his passage by one of sir williams cruisers brought to acomac tried by a courtmartial as a traitor and sentenced to be hung of course the reader will suppose that every now and then virginia the heroine makes her appearance just when it is the most heartrending and distressingat this hanging business for example however the hero gets a days grace to prepare himself for death and next morning is found to have escaped from the cellar in which he was confined the governor again returns to jamestown and through treachery again finds himself master of his capital bacon rejoins his army they march upon the town a memorable fight ensues the loyalists are beaten and the town consumed to ashes vir ginia who always had accompanied the governor now falls into the handsarms we should have saidof the hero and they get married and all that we have not recorded some of the most striking scenes because we would not too much forestall the interest with the reader we conclude this notice by stating that the characters are well supported to the end and that the author has considerable powers of description the plot is all through exceedingly well managed and the denouement comes off admirably the faults of the volumes are a little proneness to exaggeration and a dialogue generally too pompous ana elaborate there is but one attempt at the humorous and it is completely successful that of the irish adherent we may promise all who should through our recommendation read this work that they will find we give it upon good and substantial

angela pisani angela pisani by the late hon eorge sydney smythe sever viscount strangford bentleys 1875 to those to whom george smythe is anytbhi a than the name of one who for a brief space filled an am portant place in both the social and political history of the day the publication of angela pisani is a matter of interest as wel as of satisfaction to him is due the highet praise which can be awarded to a man that those who knew him best loved him most whilst those who had eves the privilege of knowing him but slightly could not fail to be attracted by his quick sympathetic and sensitive nature by means of which he was able to enter at once into the mood of his companions and frequently to ex press better than themselves what was uppermost in their minds he was in fact possessed of that rare talent of identifying himself with the feelings of others that en of all ranks and opinions were instinctively drawn to wards him and allowed themselves to be moulded and guided by his supple mind the short memoir of his career which lady sirangford prefixes to the novel is a grateful tribute to his memory and shows the admira tion and affection with which his family regarded him if we have a fault to find wvith the editor it is that she has spoken so apologetically as it seems to us of one who might well have been spoken of at this distance of time with pride but what is said is so full of tact and grace and in such harmony with her subject that it would be ungracious to quarrel with what is left unsaid nevertheless we regret that scarcely any allusion is made to mir george smythes connexion with the mlorning chronicle nor any quotations given from the many brilliant articles which he wrote for that journal his career too in the house of commons might have been treated with greater fumness and the influence of his generous temper and persuasive speaking more strongly insisted upon we rather take exception at his editors estimate of george smythes oratorical powers which when roused by a sympathetic topic were at least on a level with those of even the practised speakers of his time take for instance his speech in the session of 1853 on the bill for the removal of roman catholic disabilities which for real eloquence was not surpassed in the debate nor perhaps in the session whilst it gives a far deeper insight into the tendencies of the political school of which the original of  henry coningsby  was a leader than did many of his more purely partisan declarations mr smythe protestedagainst lord john russells bill as one of sham pains and sham penalties against a sham aggression he ridiculed the fol of legislating against spiritual faculties and pro phe sied for the church whether of rome or engad a regenerating mission when one or the other should have celebrated the free nuptials of mo dern liberty and ancient faith the alliance between rome and the socialist element of modern civili5atioet is perhaps already signed and although we wholly dissent from mir smythes views th at such an allianse will be for the welfare of mankind we are ready to admit that it offers the best chance of support to the church those who care to learn more of mr smythes strikingly versatile character cannot do better than to study the character of lioniel daveranche in the work before us it is in no way an autobiography and yet the author in common withalfred de musset to whose eiample he owes so much and of whose influence he is apparent so unconscious cannot like goethe dissociate him ebl at a given moment from his own creations like h french contemporary lie was too eager to prove that ble existed by himself and owed his position to do 0onb favour he could not allow time to ripen his mind o wished to show to the world that his genius could beur once both flower and fruit he was not one of those whom study could save from becoming the prey of b passions and thus we see both in lionel and ild the author of angela pisani a man who at times so0ff ss life but only does so from weariness of spiritwkn what he would call the moment of la jesnee 9ax66 bh passed and when it is no longer spent in the midst of a passionate delirium it is time however to turn from the author to his work which as an unfinished study it is scarcely fair to submit to the ordinary method of criticism lady strangfords tender regard for her relative has perhaps induced her to give to the world more than be would have done for it is difficult to imagine that a man of taste and literary skill as lord strangford has shown himself would have permitted 4 angela pisani to have been published in its present form it is rather the lines upon which the novel was to be constructed than a finished work of art many of the episodes which are introduced bear no relation to the main story and others only arrest the readers interest shortly the plan of the novel seems to have been to contrast the decay of the heroic and chivalrous element of society with the successful progress of the practical and rotwriwr of the former lionel daveranche is the type charles denain of the latter from their first start in school life the weaker and warmer nature is bound to and fascinated by the colder and the cynical throughout their respective careers the same moral is constantly obtruded lionel cannot succeed without the help and advice of the very man whose counsels are daily debasing him to the others level denain on the other band is able to wound his friends pride to betray his trust and to rob him of all that he most loves and yet never to lose his influence over him nor until the last to goad him to attempt revenge in the contrast of these two characters which runs throughout the book the whole interest of the story lies the episode of lionels love for illyrine de la valwhom his pride or his conceit will not permit him to marryis the most powerfully written part of the work if we except a subsequent scene when after having forsaken lionel illyrine returns to him and is in her turn forsaken for angela pisani the character of illyrine is carefully drawn and its deep rich colours is filled in with a masterhand although if judged by the standard of the novels of the present day we should be inclined to add that there is a want of true delicate analysis of character to which we have now become accustomed in real depth of passion however illyrine de la val is far superior to the heroines of the novels of the time at which lord strangford was writing those were the days of tancred  paul clifford and g p r james when the melodramatically impossible alternated with the intolerably tedious and no doubt the author of the present work correctly estimated the taste of his time in forbearing to publish a work which shows more of the analytical method of the french school of the novelists of louis phillippes reign than would have suited the popular english taste of twenty years ago we have not alluded to the plot of the story contained in these volumes for in reality it can hardly be compressed into a short space without spoiling the readers interest and moreover the plot is in itself altogether subordinate to the treatment of the four principal charactersaveranche and denain illyrine and angela this last who gives her name to the entire work plays but a secondary and somewhat insignificant role in the story and would seem to have been introduced to illustrate and support some of stendhals admirable paradoxes relative to the causes which excite and allay passion in both men and women rather than to be the centre round which the interest clings angelas own character indeed has little but its childlike simplicity to attract but she manages by turns to attract to herself in the various phases of amourpique and amourpansion the two heroes of the novel womanlike she is the cause of separation between the two who having been associates thought themselves friends and like many a woman she remains true to the one who wronged her most and accepts almost as her due the passionate devotion of the other who gives up all that life had most attractive to offer in order to tend her as a brother but there is in these volumes much beyond the story of the loves of averanche and denain and their careers in life the subordinate characters of almeric locrt i a cavalier of the king of malatesta pisani a member of the society known as the  children of hate are sketched with care and although the latter is somewhat too melodramatic for our soberer tastes it would not have been out of place at a time when the late bulwer was edifying the world of novel readers with the careers of romantic highwaymen and aesthetic murderers of far higher value are the historical sketches of napoleon prince metternich and louis xviii as an exile in england and the various conversations of mr oakworth the lancashire millowner who may stand for sir robert peel and frank dudley who has some of the qualities of lord george bentinck the social life of the period is brilliantly depicted and the political questions of the day discussed from that lofty eminence on which the young england party had thought fit to seat itself there is moreover much to be gathered from these pages both as a glimpse of the past and a help to what may yet be the future of a party which if it could find a leader who would breathe fresh fire and enthusiasm into its creed might yet be tempted to follow out the old tory creed of pitt and his bolder colleagues and who would attempt that hitherto unattained object of the partythe alliance of the aristocracy and the artisans against the philistine tendencies of the middle classes to such as care for a study of bygone times and old moods of thought for the discussion of political questions which to the last generation seemed vital and the anatomy of the passions we can promise a real enjoyment in angela pisani l g r,folklore_contra
mr wynyards ward new novels by holme lee 2 vols smith elder  co foremost amongst the qualities which make up the goodness of this clever and charming tale are a freshness of style and a peculiar newness of arrangement and manipulation which in the presence of much that shows holme lees readiness to profit by the examples of other artists and in the absence of everything that might entitle her to credit for a high degree of originality affect the reader with a pleasure closely similar to that which follows from the perusal of an author of novel aims and altogether distinctive thought in her personal plainness and courageous bearing towards her lover mr wynyards ward resembles jane eyre and many touches in her portraiture indicate currer bells influence on the author of sylvan holts daughter but it would be most unfair to hint that penelope croft is a reproduction rather than a creation so also her homely relatives from whose care she is removed in order that she may be reared in the house of a country gentleman in a manner befitting the heiress of 70000 remind us of george eliots farmers and farmers wives in the mill on the floss but no reader will need an assurance that holme lees mis croft and mrs lister are presentations of feminine character that could not have been accomplished by a writer who had not personally studied the economy and tone of that rural life in which the wives of simple yeomen live and move and have their being one or two of the characters have nothing to distinguish them from the purely conventional personages of romantic literature for instance the villainous attorney mr hargrove is even to the lines of his crafty face that same wicked lawyer who has been ruining heiresses in the pages of prose fiction for these last hundred years nor is there much of novelty in the main interest of the story which shows how mr wynyards ward remained faithful to her lover through doubt and suspicion and torturing calumny and saw his name relieved of the foul stain put upon it by malignant tongues and circumstances after she had been for years the sharer of his undeserved shame but though the plot of holme lees new tale may have been suggested by any one of a score of novels familiar to consumers of prose fiction and though it unquestionably resembles some of those wellknown stories we cannot point to the book from which  mr wynyards ward is not materially and widely different the one unsatisfactory part of the story is the commencement which introduces a crowd of persons who in no way influence the subsequent action of the dramapersons indeed who scarcely appear on the stage after the curtain has fallen on the first act but as soon as the reader has fought through the spasmodic commotion and distracting irrelevancies of the introductory chapters he finds himself moving with a story that flows on tranquilly and with steadily increasing force until its stream of pure and undefiled english terminates in an artistic ending it was a happy thought which made the author put her heroine in a position that gave her as mr wynyards n j wealthy ward rank and recognition amongst rfhe gentry of her shire whilst it left her free to maintain affectionate relations with her homely mother and to continue her old sociable intercourse with the unrefined yeomen and tenantfarmers to whose class she belonged by birth by thus rendering the warmhearted itruthloving girl a feature of two very different social circles holme lee is enabled to place in striking contrast the refinements of the gentle and the awkward frankness of the simple and in using the opportunities thus created for her power to illustrate the distinctive peculiarities of classes that touch but never mingle the author exhibits no less delicacy of discernment and taste than accuracy of observation as to the incidents which bring about penelope crofts sharp trial of love and result in the triumphant vindication of her husbands honour we forbear to give so much as a hint having no wish to diminish the pleasure which readers will experience in ascertaining them for themselves in the pages of a book than which no purer brighter or more delightful tale has for many a day come under our notice,folklore_contra

changes of local colour supplied serviceable help indeed except incompletely  il pecorone  has not been rendered into a foreign tongue the objections to it as a book for family reading are precisely those which apply to the 4 decameron and its successors but they are less considerable the writer has substituted for boccaccios garden party the authorised interviews in a convent parlour at forli of a beautiful young nun by name saturnia and her most exemplary admirer the 44 wellmannered youth of florence auretto for five  and  twenty successive days did this admirable pair meet platonically in the parlour and each tell a story mr waters in his erudite introductory essay not only relates so much as he has been able to gather about ser giovanni individually but recounts the history of his book as well as of the sources of some of the tales he incorporated and the manner and whereabouts of the few adaptations of them or parts of them which appeared after their publication a large proportion had with certain minor differences already appeared in older 44novellieri and it is fair to say with mr waters that ser giovannis versions do really 44gain in decency if not in dramatic force in the latter element they are not at all deficient at thc same time let us add that here and there a certain directness of description and vivacity is by no means wanting in  il pecorone which however knows little or nothing of the occasional coarseness of the decameron be this as it may the reader cannot fail to notice in the earlier portions of the compilation stories of the same character as those of which the 4 decameron is full while in the latter part the tales are so to say more or less travesties of legitimate histories quaint and vivid inversions of the truth for example a version of her history and of her taking for her second husband the son of the duke of bavaria ser giovanni ignored the first of her spouses  is related with a charming naivete by auretto to

of the demon looming in twilight behind him may be compared with  jesus ministered to by angels where he sleeps and the guardians outstretched hands touch his garments both these works are striking

alone in west africa by mary gaunt werner laurie the avidity with which travel books are sought after by the public is apt to thrust into the market a type of descriptive work which wilfully trades upon the readers curiosity the principle of  omne ignotum pro magnifico focuses attention on the unknown country rather than the qualities that go to the visualising of it and tends to submerge critical acumen to avoid careful study becomes an acute temptation for this reason and on account of the multiple and disconnected impressions left by a book of this nature personality is invaluable in supplying unity and distinction and fixing a rallyingpoint for the reader mrs gaunts new book fulfils this demand it is not so much that her personality is virile and commanding as that it is sufficient to cut a way for the reader through the jungle of her journeys her salient capacity is a surprising and quickening commonsense she refuses to take things on trust alert enough to test all she hears and sees by her own experience our sole objection to her lucid and conscientious narrative is that she tends to lapse into impressionistic journalism the purely descriptive portions of her adventurous jaunt through littleknown districts in west africa do not call for detailed treatment mrs gaunt started up the gambia from bathurst through the  groundnut colony a land of promise so far as productivity is concerned she skirted sierra leone the white mans grave  staying a short time at its dirty illkempt capital freetown and spent some interesting days in liberia autonomous since 1822 through the courageous experiment of america for the semicultured native she has scant praise insisting on his boorishness his arrogance his raw and blatant egoism passing through the guinea coast almost fabulous in its natural beauties she reached half assinie and the french border from elmina the old portuguese mining settlement her pilgrimage took her to accra the capital of the gold coast colony up the volta to the krobo hills infamous for the mystic bloodorgies there practised by the nearly savage inhabitants over the eketo range and so to the border into the german colony of togo thence she travelled along the coast to the best point of vantage and turned inland into ashanti which has cost england so much money and so many lives and finally dipped down from kumasi its capital to the atlantic seaboard at sekondi where her route ended like another district which we deal with elsewhere much of this country had not been traversed before by a white woman mrs gaunts facile and rather gusty style never drifts into mere enumeration of peoples places and incidents her versatility is such that wherever she goes she kindles her narrative with patches and splashes of colour particularly illuminating are her hard penetrating comments on the prevailing fetishism concerning the west african climate the theory current as to its unredeemed vileness has she observes crystallised into superstition officials go there in confident expectation of having their energies enervated and paralysed by its humidity and in a spirit of calculated disgust they flout nature by burning the candle at both ends by falling into sedentary habits and a dumb mental resentment opposed to physical wellbeing so the consequent illhealth is as much the result of internal as extraneous causes it may be readily imagined how much the administration of the country suffers when activities but halfhearted and almost morose are applied to it mrs gaunts picture of the germans as colonisers of togo is in striking contrast to the verdict just given of their alertness regularity and cheerfulness she speaks in terms of ungrudging admiration their keen and trenchant methods of organisation she opposes to the british lack of plan and casual attitude without attempting to draw invidious comparisons she speaks of the presence of broad long roads the facilities for transit the instinct for governing the scientific warfare against sleeping sickness the insistence on cleanliness and order and the anxiety to preserve natural beauties where  england seems indifferent if the beautiful spot be not within the narrow seas german women too live with their husbands in togo their helpmeets there as at home englishmen on the other hand regard such itinerant companionship as akin to sacrilege the tropics are  no white womans country immorality and discontent are the outcome so far as ashanti is concerned however mrs gaunt is less dispiriting there a succession of zealous administrators have rescued the country from internecine strife strong measures have had the stimulating effect required concerning the vexed and seemingly inscrutable problem of the native population mrs gaunt is more reticent than we could wish her conclusions are enigmatic varying in accordance with the different status of the aborigines in different parts the halfemancipated native with his veneer of culture still she declares retains the rudiments of barbarism combined with the less agreeable characteristics of civilization his isolation from both white and black and his incapacity are complete for the primitive majority she veers towards the theory of a  benevolent despotism that depends for its validity on the temperament of the despot with whom unlimited authority is hardly favourable to the growth of sympathy and understanding and is apt to become inoculated with the virus of caesarism such are the scope and achievement of mrs gaunts bookone fertile in suggestion felicitous in style

regiment in the whirl of angloindian social dissipation returns to her ancestral home at drumtochy here after refusing the hand of eminently blameless viscount she marries the free kirk minister a zealous young man and one in whom despite th authors anxious precautions wo see the makings of the clerical prig the subsequent history of the minage at the free kirk manse would we take it be instructive the union of a ballet girl and a trappist monk would forebode about as many possibilities of happiness one of those ministers however is among mr maclarens best creations this is dr jeremiah saunderson a free kirk minister in an adjoining hamlet who is worthy to be mentioned in the same breath as dominie sampson the gentle absentminded pious old bookworm fulfilled with profound and useless lore is despite the gloom of his calvinistic limitations lovable in the extreme his absentmindedness affords the authors real gift of humour free play he arrives at drumtochy with thirteen great cases bursting with tomes of the early fathers and without a stick of furniture he falls into the hands of a grim housekeeper of the old dispensation and suffers many things but he is the prey and the refuge of every wastrel in the high road when he returns from his stay at a neighbouring manse he fills his portmanteau with the antimacassars and the pillowcases of his hostess instead of with his personal garments   when he turned his back against the wind to snuff with greater comfort he was not careful to resume his original position but continued cheerfully in though new direction this weakness was so well known that the school bairns would watch till he had started and stand in a row on the road to block his further progress these humiliations are doubtless a lesson he was wont to observe withal he is a man of deep learning and of real piety one who can sacrifice what is dearest to him for conscience sake good too is the sketch of dr davidson the minister of the old kirk a courtly stately gentleman of the old school who when misfortune sudden and undeserved comes upon him in the evening of his days bears it like a gallant man ifor though rest the story rambles in

are all members of the society we wot of only the brave doctor seems missing from the familiar company but his place is occupied by the striking figure of  rabbi saunderson a singlehearted calvinist saint who if any one combines the love of man with the most slavish dread of god beyond and beneath his superficial eccentricitieshis unexhausted appetite for books his indifference and absence of mind about domestic trifles his indiscriminate charity his habit of turning his back to the wind for the convenience of taking snuff and then pursuing the direction in which he finds his facethere is suggested a spiritual conflict oi which the pure soul and attenuated frame of the rabbi are the proper theatre it is characteristic of our authors graver mood the ways of the presbytery and its clerk  the deft formalism with which they minimise the presentment of john carmichael for heresy which has caused the rabbi so many a pang and indirectly costs him his life  the admirable description of the  occasion or ministration of the sacrament the humours of beadles and the housekeepers of bachelor ministers  all these are the fruit of considerable observation and in suitable instances abound in

such occasions when a malicious traveller got the train stopped as it was quitting the platform only to inquire sweetly is this joppiea comparison of deadly insolence for one of his good things the absolution of the claret after three several appearances dr watson should have acknowledged his obligation to dean ramsay we have left ourselves no space to deal with the story  but indeed it is of the slightest we note in janet and donald an aptitude for the appreciation of highland character not very common in scotch novelists and on the whole can honestly welcome a manysided if rather heterogeneous collection of sketches by one who knows his countrymen george umber the author of ayrshire idylls of other days a gardner is as he says a sentimentalist it is also clear that he is a lover of our eighteenth century classics and that he has acquired certain mannerisms from charles lamb apart from this the even flow of reflection and reminiscence neither striking nor profound will attract few readers although for persons completely ignorant of scotland such chapters as the old pew between the preachings c may possess something of novelty it may be conceded that the authors descriptive style is fluent and that the illustrations of mr william findlay are passable there is no excess of vernacular scotch in the book and not a grain of humour the title of mr david lyalls collection of religious stories the land of the leal hodder  stoughton is probably used in its proper sense not that unaccountably adopted by mr gladstone but the series which is strung together loosely through the personality of lisbeth gray the pious wife of staneriggs the farmer has to do with scotland and more particularly with southcountry farmers miners and merchants it cannot be said that the book is particularly exciting or shows a great deal of literary power but some of the tales are pathetic notably that entitled one of the weak things of the world which might the sardonic

tales of my time by te author of blue slocking hall in 3 tols put tao a novel ought in our opinion to have indispensably annexed to it a moral exhibiting either an abhorrence of vice or a lesson in knowledge of the world the error of the day is use of the press in mere support of party or theory the old fielding novel carried with it distinctions of real life all through in the respective characters as in the ptays of shakspeare but the tom jones of fielding is dead and gone we have insipid gentlemen and ladies with slight grades of difference but no strong demarcations it is not caricature but hogarthism which is sacrificed and the latter is a real misfortune for hogarths works are sermons well does our author say such is the spread of literature that men of all calibres may turn their talents to profit but it will never do to stand shilly shally weighing the veracity of a judgment if you engage your brains in the service of the public you must accommodate yourself to the ruling taste and an author should feel like an advocate at the bar let him make the most of the materials given and leave the world to judge iii 195 philosophers will submit to no such degradation because they know that improvement the real intention of all correct use of the press is absolutely murdered we are happy therefore to say that the novel before us has in its two tales of  who is she  and sthe young reformers excellent morals the one is the woeful consequence of petting an only son and tampering with delicate feelings the second that of adopting absurd politics the characters are finely drawn and perfectly natural and there are in the byeplay most dramatic delineations particularly of irish manners and persons it is not caricature got up for effect but actual life analysed and chemicised by deconposition and submission to the crucible mankind are influenced in their characters and actions by their respective necessities and no principles can stand before interest if no disgrace attends the latter we believe that the efforts of individuals to better themselves is in the aggregate result a public good and that all the public has to do is to prevent a knavish or foolish use of the principle of selfinterest this novel has much of this useful tendency in action it is just philosophical and natural and whoever reads it must acquire an accession of knowledge of sentimentals made grammar rules through their consequential and physical exemplications there are iiresponsible thieves and it is useful to have the science and experience of police officers to guard against them because we cannot take them up the salans of both these tales consist in one of a fellow that ought to have been hanged and in another of one who was hanged in both instances the moral and there fore the instruction is palpable in modern education the amiable is sacrificed for accomplishment and dislasrforeigners have noticed that the english relish nothing that is not ex pensive but there are modes of reconciling conviviality and happiness well portrayed in the following paragraph the dinner was abundant and its deficiency in setting off was but little observed where all the guests were kindly disposed in fact that paltry criticism which is the terror and scourge of a country neighbourhood is much oftener the offspring of stupor than malevolence keep a company alive and they will seldom be able to tell whether your damask is of scotch or hamburg manufacture your china indian or worcester your glass cut or plain people only ask to be happy and how this is accomplished is never inquired into but if tongues are not employed eyes will be busy i 63 64 we like to see novels which supersede chesterfieldian lettersare medical not poisonous this is one and it does not preach a sad obstruction to the moral influence of a novel because novel readers have pampered appetites the condiments must carry down the meal we are sure that this novel carries with it its own recommendation,folklore_contra

a gigantic disharmony explanation of this mysterious duality must be left to the doctors now that our personalities are controlled by our glands so that if we have plenty of pituitary we are artists and too little adrenalis it  moralists  in choosing a single novel to label with those words so dear to the confectioners of symposiums  the greatest ever written i would select  war and peace in it tolstoy rides two themes like a circus rider on his two piebald horses and by a miracle reaches the stable door still mounted and still whole the secret of his triumph lies in the sheer interest with which his creative energy has invested every passage the book is six times as long as an ordinary novel but it never flags never wearies the reader and the ground  introduction to  anna karenina in

of him the opening chapters describing him at an unkind moment in his fortunes are inimitable as for the portrait of annas husband alexev alexandrovichit inspires in us the feelings that he must have inspired in anna the early parts of this great novel are the best for i have never been convinced that anna in the circumstances shown would have committed suicide it is as if tolstoy had drawn her for us with such colour and solidity in the beginning that we cannot believe she is not in the end dismissed by him rather than by herself anna in fact is a warm pulsating person with too much vitality to go out as she did the finish strikes one as vonu as if the creator had turned against his creature and one forms aislya aad nikila scene from tolstoys play the power of darkness the opinion that tolstoy started on this book with the free hand of an unlimited sympathy and understanding but during the years that passed before he finished it became subtly changed in his outlook over life and ended in fact a preacher who had set out an artist it is however no uncommon flaw in writers to misjudge the vitality of their own creations an illustration of the same defect is the suicide of paula in  the second mrs tanquerav  ladies with her sort of past have too much vitalitv to put a period to themselves except in plays and novels with this reservation  anna karenina is a great stud of russian character and a great picture of russian societyla picture that held good with minor variations up to the war tolstoys method in this novel as in all his work is cumulativethe method of an infinity of facts and pictorial detail the opposite of turgenevs who relied on selection and concentration on atmosphere and poetic balance tolstoy fills in all the spaces and leaves little to the imagination but with such vigour such fresh ness that it is all interesting his style in the narrow sense is by no means remarkable all his work bears the impress of a mind more concerned with the thing said than with the way to say it but if one may add to interminable definitions style is the power in a writer to remove all barriers between himself and his reader  the t r i u m p h of style is the creation of intimacy then though such a definition will put many out of court it will leave tolstoy a stylist for no author in h i s storytelling produces a more i n t i m a t e feeling of

and a masterwork produced the prime characteristic of tolstoy as a novelist was certainly his unflinching sincerity his resolute exposition of what seemed to him the truth at the moment remembering

will remember almost every paragraph dickens and dumas are perhaps the only other writers who c o m p a r e with him in this respect the character of levin is undoubtedly a  selbstportrdt or at least a study of the side of tolstoys own nature which was preoccupying him at that period the chapters describing levin in the country are very clearly a r e n de r in g of his own efforts and feelings just count leo tolstoy last photograph from life taken september 99og when he was beginning to be profoundly disturbed about the meaning of life a n d to develop his  peasant  philosophy of c xistence

prove that what he himself felt and saw was what the average man could feel and see and in all this long attempt we are conscious of the distortion which comes when an artist and thinker tries to put himself into the skin of the normal man or rather tries to put the normal man into his own skin a useful illustration of such distortion occurs in one of conrads early stories  the return where a

heroine describes herself quite accurately as a  very strenuous person in her early youth she gives the impression of a capable but illfeatured young woman of a vengeful nature soured by a series of family misfortunes and bowed down by a weight of disagreeable responsibilities time and prosperity however have a beneficial effect upon nora crofts character though as a heroine she is never attractive gradually she is forced to learn the lesson of tolerance towards the family of the man who was her fathers friend and whom for reasons not wholly valid she persists in regarding as the archenemy of her house and founder of its misfortunes finally trouble of the same sort overtakes the medletts longwaitedfor vengeance is within her grasp but love coming rather late into her life obliges her to forswear her childish vendetta and to pay the sum of forgiveness to its uttermost farthing apart from this one character which if treated with too many heroics is carefully studied the book concerns itself with a peculiarly uninteresting class of people and has no particularly remarkable quality to recommend it  the uttermost farthing by b p neuman 6s black this book more than fulfils the promise of mr neumans earlier work the idea is novel and carefully worked out told briefly the plot is this two men croft crofts and medlett friends only in the conventional sense of the word embark at medletts suggestion upon an unsound speculation medlett sells out in time but ashamed of his want of judgement delays to warn crofts crofts is unmanned by his loss and goes under leaving his children to face the world alone after a desperate struggle they pull through thanks mainly to nora a masterful but fascinating girl at last medlett fails as crofts had failed and is reduced to begging from the children of the man he had ruined it was the moment for which nora with her fierce yearning for vengeance had longed and prayed now at lastbut we had better leave the reader to discover what vengeance nora took such is the story improbable as it seems told in rough outline which mr neumann handles in masterly fashion we wish he could have spared us noras middleaged admirer the episode makes the book a little disjointed and it would have been easy to give her money in some simpler way as a whole the book is excellent nothing could be more convincing than the picture of the moral and mental collapse of john crofts the delineation of nora crofts herself strongwilled embittered by her struggle wildly revengeful and yet noble is a really striking bit of work

high summer by richard church dent 7s 6d high summer is full of surprises and neetly all of then are peasant it is a novel by a poet with a rare andsentive understanding of natural beautyand it concerns the commercial adventures of filosilk ltd the firm that put silk stockings into the sixpenny bazaars it is modern in temper yet it does that thing which mrs woolf and other equally distinguished critics have said that georgians cannot doit tels a robust and vivid story racing ahead with nineteenthcentury conviction it contains one of the best portraits of an able woman with a genius for busi ness negotiation that i have yet encountered in a novel and it is by a man the last achievement of couse ought not to be surprising mr church has made himself free of norah holgates personality because he has regarded her as a person a clum powerful obstinate courageous hum being who happens also to be a passionate and fullblooded young woman and as a human being she lives her gestures and her phrases are inevitable thus we are convinced she would have moved these were her thoug thus she would have behaved from the moment when in freiburg she knocked over the vase in the hotel till the final moment when she stood looking at her old london home dreaming of the town of freiburg where she will see her lover and whee she will bear his child the portrait of norah and the speed and assurance of the narrative carry us straight through the book excited and unquestioning it is od1y when the last chapter has ended and the spell has waned a little that the power to criticise returns and we begin to feel that we have been hypuotised the plot is commonplce norahs mastery of the technique of business is quite miraculously rapidsavouring more of a triumphantare fairystory of the magazines than of a novelists sober vision of reality her haven with uncle tom and aunt anne might have been borrowed strabt i from a sentimental movie her husbands death the discovery which saves the firm the happy ending seem all too arbitrary and as for the lovestory of a goldenhearted businessman his woman partner his ungenerous prudish wife and her invertebrate husband surely surely this has been done so often that it almost writes itself  yet the novel is not hackneyed if the story has been told before mr church retells it as though he were its only author and begetter if norahs technical achievements lack reality her spiritual development is so right that the rest slides into unimportance here is a full strong vigorous story written with fine distinction following the orthodox tradition of the english novel and containing one portrait so honest and vivid that it deserves more than momentary life it wears its faults as though they were virtues and few novels can be said to do more than that winifred holtby  high summer rv richard church 7s 6d ident this is richard churchs second novel and let it be said at once that it reveals an

mlr church has now thrown overboard in  high summer he has given us a passionate story told for the most part with a simplicity that sears a strength that trusts norah the woman whose heroic struggles with herself and ws ith the world about her are the theme of the novel is a creature of living brain and blood there are at least two crises in her emotional life which remain palpitant in the readers mind long after the book has been put by these scenes rise in a crescendo of peaks out of the novels slow ascent to its climax for here is a novel architecturally conceived its material all purposefully assembled towards the required end high summer opens in the black forestthose sombre mountains in the poetic south of germanyand it is in this section that the poet perhaps not altogether fortunately seems to predominate over the novelist the picture painted is so vivid that the absence of any such sensuous background in the consequent sections tends to leave the reader rather high and dryafter an excursion so vivid it is necessarily some time before he gets accustomed to the barren landscape against which for very bareness of background he is intended ultimately to realise the clearer the movements of the several characters that inhabit it it is in fact too great a stride from the pagan beauty of the mountains to the ironic fatuities of life in one of the ministries the characterisation of norah however completely triumphs over such errors of judgment but if norah discovering herself and discovering the world fighting the opposition of forces personal and forces social is an altogether magnificent piece of work her mother lady holgate and her husband alan trenchard are frankly disappointing it was not necessary surely to paint either the one so impossibly vague or the other so count of lonaford auhor of  making conversation  goilancz impossibly futile in order to show up the heroines purposeful strength a far finer study is anthony swavne who leaves

such a plan she would sooner have sent her child to the foundling hospital than consign him to the care of a mau aahom she had so grievously avronged the mockery of the letter which was to be given to him on leaving his guardian and which was to reveal the mystery that overclouded him gives the reader a sensation of disgust aud indignation at the weak selfish cruelty of the mother who could prepare so much gratuitous suffering for her child the mother is so detestable that the reader comforts himself with the reflection that the author has failed to make her in the likeness of human nature wilfreds subsequent reformation and moral redemption from his morbid selfconsciousness do not enlist the sympathy of the reader there is good writing in the book and in spite of faults of construction the story is interesting and readable but it is not satisfactory the only moral that ave can gather from it is perhaps not the one the author intended but ave give it as a true one nevertheless viz that human beings cannot avert the consequences of their actions to bear them patiently is the only true or rational avay of meeting them and all attempts to be better and wiser than providence by saving others from the effects of their own conduct is sure to bring avorse suffering in the stead of that which it is sought to escape we look forward to a better and pleasanter book at some future

uarda a romance of ancient egypt by georg ebers from the german by clara bell london sampson low  co 1877 tue very learned and brilliant author of this book tells us distinctly in his preface that its historical and archaeological features are but of secondary importance and that he wishes it to be read and criticised simply as a novel it seems to me that he has hot done his book justice by this remark and that most readers of this as of his previous novel an egyptian princess will in spite of the authors directions pay great attention to the scenery and costume and even seek to obtain from the story as such some better notion than most people have of old egyptian life the value of historical novels in teaching history has been variously estimated and scholastic people nowadays are inclined to despise them to me they seem very valuable aids in giving some sort of lifepicture of other days and if aristotle thought that tragic poetry was more philosophical than history on account of its filling out and colouring the dry outlines of hard fact so a good historical novel may be far more instructive and philosophical than many of our histories how many people have obtained true and lively views of charles the bold from anne of geierstcin or of the french revolution from the comtesse de charity  when therefore an egyptologist of prof ebers position gives us an egyptian novel based upon the monuments and papyri of the date of ramses il we expect not only entertainment but solid instruction nor will the reader find himself disappointed the external detail is very carefully filled in the theological and philosophical views of the priests are expanded in conversations perhaps too lengthy and minute characters from all classes of society are introduced and though their strange names are at first hard to remember we must do the author the credit to say that he has kept his characters distinct and has drawn thera with considerable psychological power but we confess that the less egyptian the story becomes the more interesting and lifelike is its progress as the author expressly wrarns us he has not excluded modern sentiment and this may not be false though it cannot be proved true of the old egyptians the scenery of mount sinai which he knows from personal experience is very admirably and vividly painted and we must admire his selfcontrol when he introduces moses in one scene and refrains from letting him reappear this is indeed treating the reader most generously but when we come to consider the historical sources which he has used it appears to us that he has made very free use of them indeed in some cases it is true that though he says that mes it was the egyptian name of moses he does not shock us with the whole theory of prof lauth who ascribes the stillextant roving adventures of a mohar of that name to the great lawgiver still the identification of the names is very doubtful but this is moderate compared with the account of king ramses il taken wholly from the wildest and most extreme flatteries which have survived in contradiction to many good historical inferences the king is not only represented as a marvellous warrior which may be true but as a father of his people as a man of genius of large heart and great benevolence which must surely bc false the iron despotism of his rule seems hardly compatible with the gentle and loveable features in prof ebers picture of him we also fancy from our scanty knowledge of the period that the noble and intellectual characters of the kings daughter bentanat and her intimates are beyond the condition of even the highest ladies of that time but here at least there is nothing to contradict any novelist the drawing of the greek invaders is also a questionable matter in the first place the fact of greek invasions in the fourteenth century bc is exceedingly doubtful nor are the two names occurring on though monuments which scholars would identify with aiuo and aato at all received in this sense by the most cautious critics but whether the danai did threaten egypt under ramses or not they were certainly not the beautiful and dignified people represented in the art of phidias 1000 years afterwards and yet such they appear in prof ebers sketch of them he has warned us in his excellent preface that we must not imagine the real old egyptians as they were represented in their own art he notes most justly that the rules and conventions of a strict hieratic canon prevented the artists of old egypt with a very few remarkable exceptions from attempting to imitate real life and he calls his novel an erlos ung siv eric in which he breaks through stiff formality and paints them as the most lively and versatile of men i fear that in the case of the danai he has allowed himself to fall into a trap of this kind and has been misled by an artistic type not worse but better than the real men who have indeed been perpetually misconceived because of the impressions produced by their art here and there through the book there are indications of awful oppression and cruelty which are without doubt historical and perhaps the most certain traits which we can attribute to the period the description of the gold mines for which he refers to diodorus discloses indeed one of the most shocking instances of wholesale cruelty that the world has witnessed but with great good taste he does not allow these scenes any prominence they form a dark background to the splendour of the pharaonic life the scepticism of the physician nebsecht and the ultramontane policy of the priests are both probable enough though they strike us as suggested by the authors personal experiences in the germany of the present day what prof ebers says of the art of the old egyptians is to a great extent true of their literature also so far as we possess it there are so many forms of politeness formulas of religion fixed types of language and general formality of expression that it is very hard to conceive warm hearts and wild passions under all this mass of conventional stiffness yet our author is certainly right and has done well to correct the impressions produced by the egyptian rituals and inscriptions and pictures his plot is vigorous and full of movement and if the great number and variety of his characters compel him to produce too many unexpected meetings they add to the interest and beauty of the story the reservation of ramses himself and the epic of pentaour till the third volume is another instance of wisc economy in an author who feels himself in no want of incident and who has rather too much than too little material at his disposal nevertheless uarda will hardly take a place among firstrate french or english works of fiction as an instructive and amusing sketch of life in egypt under ramses ii it should be widely and heartily welcome in adding a few words of criticism on the translation of the work we would not have it imagined that we underrate the difficulty of an idiomatic rendering of one language by another the translator is apt to see the original through the translation and so rest satisfied with sentences which seem foreign enough to the english reader viewed with a critical eye there aro many faults to be found in the present instance especially in the earlier parts in which the english version is often very strongly flavoured with german idioms there are also some useful notes omitted there are even somo mistakes such as haggard men for hagcre mcnschen birdhaunted woods for wildreiche wiilder and courageously for getrostall these in the preface elsewhere we have thichlegged for wadcnstarh used of a man and danaids for danaer such trifles might be multiplied and indeed it is only in the number of them that their weight as objections lies but anyone who has himself undertaken such a task will justly look away from these particulars and more especially in a novel attend to the general effect of the translation regarded merely as an english book he will find it on thc whole a readable and even spirited rendering and will be disposed to commend the translator for bringing so interesting a book within the reach of english readers j p maixaffy,folklore_contra

the island providence by frederick niven london john lane 6s it is hard to criticise this book  it is a wonderful book  one feels inclined to say and then fall to thinking over the wealth of it some might follow the base plot of how john upcott breeched as we are told in chapter i on september 7 1675 was blooded and went out to the spanish main and fought and swore and loved and was captured and lived in cartagena as a teacher of english and swashed innumerable bucklers and finally came back to devon and some might take it for mere buccaneering and  tuskery as stevenson used to say it would then be necessary to remind them of voltaires account of hamsl there is quarrelling fighting killingone would imagine this piece to be the work of a drunken savage the island providene must be read not only for the fighting and the adventures  lord what fun   but for the wealth of incidental joy in the curious subtleties of life for the characters the old man of the bees and avery and thomsie ravenning and cassandra and teach and that beautiful corruption the perilous senorita of the casa blanca above all for the glowing artful style a style that is very elaborate without losing a broad movement and colouring and that has learned much from the elizabethans and not a few turns from j m synge and the modern irishmen mr niven has seen for himself terrible adventures that are in the world and retains the artists eye with captain avery he might say  i have taken all my liquor neat and my life too and all my victuals underdone but for all thatthem opals i could sit afingering and turning over quite a while curiously enough in this book such is the virtue of imagination these things are even more strongly realised than in mr nivens first book the lost cabin mine which was a simpler setting of adventure in modern times mr nivens very knowledge betrays him in chapter xii into a sudden change of key so vivid is the description of a fight on board the torridge maid so obviously the description of an eyewitness the island providence is a book that must be read there is more in it than can be mentioned in a review there is to begin with life and philosophy  mr frederick niven the island providence bv frederick niven 6s john lane when mr frederick nivens first book the lost cabin mine was published those who had been told it was a firstborn agreed that it had great promise but had they been ignorant of this they might have recognised not only promise but accomplishment that book contained features new to english romance in his second book mr niven comes into line with the great tradition of the english novel as distinct from the tale of romantic adventure he has added something to the novel as such not form not perhaps treatment although somewhat of the latter but more particularly temperament he is smollett spiritualised smollett with inward vision his style is nervous and intense and not yet entirely free of its masters but it is always strong with the masculine note of the best part of the seventeenth century but above all things mr niven is honest so honest at times that he himself even is forced to pause and admire his admiration of his own frankness takes an apologetic form but it is a conceit none the less and a criticism of our squeamish age as well as for instance his  pardon me gentlemen after the tragicomic accident to the breeches of little john upcott the appeal to gentlkeicu is excellent satire all the same and again in the grim realism of chapter xii where in a description of a sailors fracas he stops before the recital of a particularly gruesome incident to remind us that  this is lite not a story in which only pretty things happen indeed  the island providence  is not a story at all it is a novel in the best sense of an abused word it is a slice of life at the close of the seventeenth century starting in devonshire among peasants and seafaring men continuing among buccaneers and desperadoes in the indies and closing in devon again with lovelorn upcott the central figure gazing with puckered eves    into the nothingness faro beyond the verge of the climbing sea the book abounds w ith incident but never for the sake of incident all its stirring occurrences are mosaics in the building of character some might urge that upcotts character is indefinite but this would be a shallow view upcott only appears indefinite because he is revealed before a background which expands over half a world the rest of the characters are vivid miniatures some like mrs upcott cassandra and tomasina old uncle ravenning and captain avery are delightful whilst there are several which move almost uncivilised emotions he possesses a keen sense of the romance of reality mingling his frankness and his exact powers of observation with a curious oldworld pose which makes his style strut and peacock itself like a man who sets his hat at a raffish angle for vanity but behind it all there is a robust optimism  he believes things will right themselves eventually and in such a happy fatalism he wveaves his intensely tragic theme with deliberate and obvious artifice accomplishing a memorable piece of reading and good literature  the uland providence by frederick niven john lane mr niven must be welcomed to the ranks of novelists who really count he has imagination and a vivid power of setting forth life which should carry him far this story is in essence a patch of life cut out of the closing quarter of the seventeenth century mr niven has taken a youth of that period living in north bevon has in a few graphic chapters painted his home life and the barbaric conditions of the times and has thence introduced him to the searovers of the spanish main the faults of the book he in its disconnectedness but it is largely the discontinuity of biography one feels that john upcott is a real person and actually went through the adventures here related crudities there are in the volume but the narrative has force and carries conviction except that the atmosphere in which the tale concludes seems modernized it was unnecessary and one is almost sure that the real story would have concluded on a note less soft and sympathetic however that is perhaps an individual opinion  i the island providence by frederick niven john lane 6s net we have vigorous writing here indeed so volcanic is it with the glamour and heat and crime of human strife and passions as to leave ones senses numbed by its sicken ing power johi upcott the hero of this fifteenth century romancej is

by wreckers he has the misfortune to shoot a drunken and brutal father this scene of human fury and bloodshed is but an introduction to others more appolling and tumultuous but dragged as he is by a

the secret dispatch  or the adventures of cap tam balgonie by james grant virtue cv uo russians must look back with a strange mixture of pride and pain to the thirtyfour years reign of catherine the second it is certain that none of her predecessors had ruled the people with a more iron hand or crushed them into ignobler bondage yet it may be questioned if any did more to raise the status of the empire in the eyes of the world to improve its social condition or to sow the seeds of that progress which has been steadily devel oping itself it is matter for surprise indeed  that this critical epoch in russian history has j not attracted far more attention than it has two facts are perhaps the best explanations  that can be given of the neglect one is that little as the rest of europe knows even now j with any certainty of what is going on in the  great eastern country our information today  bears a greater proportion to the information attainable then than the news of english i papers bears to the news of a hundred  years ago the other is that it is only within  the memory of living men that russia has begun to be included even in the range of civili ization much less regarded as a country capable  of anything better than spasmodic changes and unsystematic vagaries whatever the causes however the period from 1762 to 1796 is undoubtedly worthy of vastly more notice than has been given to it and from the pages of levesque mannstein and villebois at least enough can be got to reward the pains of reading them the story and character of catherine alone form a romance by themselves a comj parative parvenue beside ninetenths of her ooort intoxicated by suddenly finding herself rife of a man whose weakness and debaucheries yjrtually transferred an empire to her hands possessed of a clearheadedness which prevented even her intoxication being more than a useful ally of an ambition which disdained the thought of any restingplace of a heartlessness which stopped at nothing and of an intellect before which the most unmanageable bowed trusted by nobody and hated by all and hardly recognising such a consideration as personal expediency  this medley of profligacy good taste selfishness and generosity eclipses in our eyes her more famous predecessor peter this characterthe patron of art science and  education the originator of a methodical administration of justice the introducer of vaccination among her subjects the founder unless we are mistaken of the second foundling hospital in the world and the inpersonation of cruelty aud vice  mr grant has chosen for the foundation of his hst historical novel it is not often that we have to complain of novelists that they do not make their books long enough but we cannot  help thinking a mistake has for once been committed in the present case better materials than catherines entire reign we need hardly  say nobody could have had at handall the  better for a work of fiction by reason of the frequent absence of certainty as to minutia mr grant however though he has studied his subject has selected one little incident one of the darkest amid a crowd of dark ones and contented himself with moulding it into a onevolume tale the incident is this on the death of anne in 1742 her grandnephew ivan the sixth styled by mr grant ivan the  fourth had succeeded to the thronean infant less than a year oldonly however to be deposed and imprisoned within a few months by elizabeth when elizabeths successor peter the third was in his turn deposed and imprisoned by his wife catherine the latter found ivan now a youth of about twentyfour a dangerous obstacle to her security  and on the discovery of a conspiracy to restore him to his rights at once had him privately put to death in his dungeon out of this it is that the volume before us is constructedthe secret dispatch being the empresss order for the assassination sent to the governor of the state prison by one of the many british officers then in the russian service the perils he went through in carrying his charge from novgorod to st petersburg the chapter of accidents by which he became betrothed to the sister of the chief conspirator and the eminently disagreeable complications to which his loveaffairs led interwoven with a few pictures of russian society are the sumtotal of a book which might with advantage have been three times as long as to what there is we have no hesitation in saying it is worth reading probably indeed it gains in interest about as much as it loses by want of substance a little lovetale of only three years scope if it is well toldas this is just melancholy enough to enlist ones sympathies ending just happily enough not to bring on the blues and keeping the sentimental part of ones nature on perpetual tenterhooks by all sorts of lifeordeath tossups has something pleasant in its very sound and as a novel of this kind it is undoubtedly the most successful the author oas produced as an historical one we have already expressed disappointment on one ground and on another point we wink there is a want of sound judgment history put into the persuasive form of fiction ttght not to be altered more than is absolutely requisite for the purposes of art not only do all such unnecessary changes prevent a book being of real use but they are apt to do positive harm by causing it to leave wrong impressions behind why then should mr grant have gone out of his way to represent the incident on which the whole of his story turns differently from the fact  it would have been just as easy to mould his plot on the true account of mierowitzs mad conspiracy as on a purely imaginative one while no interest whatever is added by the gratuitous inaccuracy of representing the conspirators attacking ivans prison from without instead of according to unanimous authority taking advantage of their position as the garrison of the fortress itself in minor details such as mierowitzs social grade the actual origin of his animosity towards catherine and in others of little or no importance the romancer is fairly entitled to his licence but the best principle on which to go from step to

the tallants of barton a tale of fortune and finance new novels by joseph hatton 3 vols tinsley brothers the leading incidents of a financial crisis may ke so readily used as part of the machinery of a work of fiction that we cannot be surprised if many of our novelists avail themselves of last years commercial excitement as part of their materials while it still remains fresh in the memory of the public mr hatton is one out of many who have seized the opportunity and his description of the panic is worked in with a light and skilful hand and shows him to be a writer of humour and observation the account of the meeting of the eastern banking company at the london tavern is graphic and amusing and while we pity the poor clergyman from the country who  insists upon knowing the position of the company we sympathise with the merriment of the more knowing shareholders who cannot help laughing in spite of their own anxieties at the innocent earnestness with which he reiterates his futile inquiry the scenes of london life are fairly drawn probably for this reasonthat the author does not attempt those lofty flights in which many an icarus of literature has lost his pinions the story is one of character rather than incident until we get to the last volume when a murder and a discovery come to vary the course of proceedingsthe former incident relieving the drama from a personage who is scarcely respectable enough to be allowed to bow at the footlights although there is not perhaps any great depth in the characters they have the merit of being true to nature and sufficiently contrasted among themselves thus there is a certain amount of grotesque fun in mr and mrs dibble while phoebe tallant is lovely and gentle amy somerton proud and resolute arthur phillips honest and enthusiastic the hon lionel hammerton undecided and suspicious whence it happens that arthur is rewarded by a happy marriage and lionel lives to see the only girl he loves become the wife of his elder brother the earl of verner this is amys revenge on her first lover for having slighted her and on herself for having ever listened to his addresses the chief interest of the last volume lies in the discovery of the murderer and the discomfiture of the local policeman who thinks he has a clue of his own and looks with contempt on the great london detective till the latter quietly works out the matter and turns the tables upon the unfortunate country official mr hatton should be more careful about his phraseology and should not put such expressions as  ivliatever will become of us all and  there is lots of scandalous things said in the mouths of educated people nevertheless this is a readable novel and apart from errors of diction such as those to which we have alluded it is a wellwritten book,folklore_contra
the blue buckle by william hamilton osborne hodder  stoughton 6s the criminal financier has always been a favourite subject of the authors of tales of mystery the romantic and successful amateur detective and the illused heroine with an ailing father are perhaps even more popular characters the point about 4 the blue buckle  is its ingenious manipulation of these timehonoured effects we wonder that mr osborne makes use of so ancient a device as the secret passage but on the other hand he has invented a means of establishing an alibi by the use of the kinematograph and he understands the possibilities of the dictaphone the story contains much apparatus and the scenes change with such startling rapidity that we are led to regard the plot as first invented for the purposes of the kinematograph this is especially suggested by the manner in which the various mysteries are never allowed to gather  as soon as a single interest begins to predominate it is exploded and another takes its place  the blue buckle  has the merit of being an admirably constructed if improbable story,folklore_contra

the dwale bluth hebditchs legacy and other literary remains of oliver madoxbrown author of  gabriel denver edited by w m rossetti and f hueffer london tinsley brothers 1876 the results of the brief literary life of the author of gabriel denver illustrate one not uncommon phenomenon while they are an exception to another the son of an historical painter this wondrous boy for he was but twenty when he died was an instance of the not unfrequent union of pictorial talent with rare gifts of literary description precocious as a child he had never say his biographers up to the time of his death  so much as left for many weeks together the shelter of his paternal roof only for a couple of years before he entered his teens does he seem to have attended even a dayschool yet his work exhibits a lively negative to the saw that homekeeping youths have ever homely wits  and whether we examine his extraordinary juvenile watercolours or study the romances into which more than into his paintings he threw inherited  qualities of prompt solid realistic invention and dramatic force and directness it is impossible to help marvelling at the breadth of his observation the keenness of his eye for scenery and natural forms and objects and the retentiveness with which he husbanded for use as occasion served the sights he saw and the facts he noted at sixteen or thereabouts after singular successes in watercolour painting he wrote the black swan as it is given in the second of these volumes the original draught of his gabriel denver which was published in 1873 by messrs smith and elder he had thought it out and those who take the trouble to read it will be struck by its strong imaginative power and sustained force of passion when he was yet but fifteen like an aeschylean drama in its limited dramatis personae the black swan has but three actors on its scene which is mostly the burning wreck of a tasmanian emigrant ship a strongwilled halfeducated settler his unloved desperate wife and the girl whom gabriel denver idolises and who clings to him in life and death with a sort of mesmeric fascination there are some bits of this extraordinary tale eg gabriel denvers dream from which he wakes to a gradual discovery of the ship being on fire his jealous wifes doing and that wifes previous overhearing gabriel and lauras lovemaking upon the deck while they remain as utterly unconscious of her presence  as a bird is of a lynx which is hidden in the foliage waiting for a spring   or again in the crisis of the black sivanjs fate the description of the way in which fire and water clear away all the live figures from the burning deck except a trio  physically held together as the author puts it  by the ties of passion the hatred and love which entangled them mentally which must be owned to be of grand conception and the phenomena of the ocean on which they drift in an open boat for three or four days in its rest and its disturbance as well as of hunger and thirst in their gradually developed stages betoken a conscientious study of records of like adventures not always to be found in young authors of rich imagination the writer of such a tale may have resolved to forsake the brush from other motives than  some restive idiosyncrasy  forbidding him  to tread the paternal vestiges perhaps he felt a constraining sense that the canvas fails to tell a whole tale with the breadth and detail and ample verge of the written romance anyhow he dedicated himself to literature the dwale bluth a devon synonym of the deadly nightshade arose out of a five weeks visit to lynmouth and its environs in 1871 and shows inter alia the grasp with which young madoxbrown fastened upon a congenial subject the weird region of the yethhounds the dartmoor legend of the logan stone tanta rabobs huxen or the devils ankleblade and the tradition of a family bold and mad enough to cherish an ancestral dwelling beneath the latter furnished him with a theme sufficiently full of loves and hates and marriages and misadventures to supply ample food for a thrilling tale of wonder and terror into this tale the aspiring author throws two ingredients unmeddled with by him hitherto dialectic peculiarities and a quasicomic element when the last baronet but one of the serpleton race dies the dartmoor folk said  dang ma buttons nif settens nainself daunt warnt ter ba shut on un

introduces her with almost fatal consequences to the dwale bluth or atropa belladonna  and the eating of its berries contrary to her uncles warning wellnigh cuts short a life prolonged to worse purpose and not even afterwards unconnected with the baneful  crazebloom at the close of the tale so far as its author finished it we find helenthe supposed widow of one thurlstone of watersmeet who had gone to australiawith the  dwal flewrs till her hair seated under the topmost crag of the castle rock near linton and lavishing reciprocated love on her cousin arthur haeuton a blind poet whom she had loved before her marriage with the master of watersmeet upon them comes unawares the deadalive husbandan intensely tragic situation on which our only criticism shall be that thurlstones eavesdropping in this instance seems to resemble and to be a reproduction of dorothys unseen watch on gabriel and lauras lovepassages in though black swan the unwilling wife follows her lord to a hated home as the alternative to his taking summary vengeance on her helpless lover who wanders homeward in a maddened despair and when ere long his love strangles herself in her long dwal flewr  ornamented hair feels his way to her grave and poisons himself with the berries of her fatally favourite plant enough has been said of two of oliver madoxbrowns romances to guarantee the readableness of the third hebditchs legacy though we do not think it as clearlydrawn or as attractive this may be due to a more tangled plot and more shadowy characters perhaps too chambers in cliffords inn and barracks and balconies at rochester present a worse field for romance and the appetite fails for the romance of willcases madoxbrowns conscientious editors have printed enough of his prose and poetry to assure us that had his life not been cut short in its very flower he would have poured forth richer and more perfect fruit of a rare and teeming fancy even the delirium stage of his fatal illness blood poisoning was an incessant forge of romance and tragedy and that there must have been a germ of social and conversational charm about this earlytaken life may be inferred from the touching memorial verses of his friend philip bourke marston pp 2130 james davies  the divale bluth hebditcks legacy and other literary remains of oliver madoxbrovm edited by william m rossetti and f hueffer with a memoir 2 vols tinsley brothers nothing is sadder than to find that the first fruits of early geniusas yet but half matured are the last results we shall ever get yet this will often happen the imagination so soon excited the nerves so highly strung are at once the cause of the promise in the present and of its nonfulfilment in the future the strain has been too great the sword has been too sharp no recent instance illustrates this so strongly as the brief memoir and fragmentary stories that messrs tinsley have published it was in the autumn of 1873 that a strangelooking book of a livid yellow binding with black figures of a burning ship and wreathing smoke and gnawing rats stamped upon the back appeared before the world it was easy for the critics to discern power in its graphic descriptions and in its vigorous language and to this j ustice was done but on the other hand there was a horrible plot and an exaggerated tone which at times became almost grotesque so that the impression finally left was one of repulsion and distaste for few of the readers of the tale were not aware that its author was still a boy and that  gabriel denver was written when oliver madoxbrown was but seventeen years of age had they known this the feeling of wonder and of hope would have been stronger than any other the volumes before us contain the first version of gabriel denver which bore originally the picturesque name of the black swan a name which the publishers with the same stupidity that insisted on altering hawthornes the marble faun into transformation changed into the present commonplace title the same unhappy influence also weakened the story itself by changing the jealous wife into a lover and by giving to the hideous plot an inartistically happy end of the memoir with which the volumes open there is nothing good to say two editors might between them one would think have given a sketch of this gifted boy which would have impressed itself on the memory as it is there are in all but twenty pages and of these about a third are with questionable taste taken up with the prattlings of his childhood and the ravings of his last delirium did he write no letters that might be quoted1 is nothing of his conversation when in health remembered 1 some memorial lines alone by mr philip marston which in their pathetic beauty recall cowleys elegy on mr william harvey seem to convey to us an idea of what oliver madoxbrown really was for the rest we have the barest facts he was born in 1855 when he was eight he began to paint in watercolour in 18g0 when only fourteen he was an exhibitor at the dudley gallery in 1871 he exhibited at the new british institution and in the winter of that year he turned his brush into a pen and wrote the black swan there came some unfinished romances which are here presented to the world and thenthe end in 1874 the poor boy died his brain active to the last still planning new stories or visited by strange visions of the stories before us the fragmentit is only a fragmentcalled  the dwale bluth  a local name for the deadly nightshade is decidedly the finest there is something about it which reminds us of the brontesbut of emily rather than of charlotte this resemblance which seems also to have struck mr marston is chiefly in the character of the incidents and the description of scenery while a certain introspective glance a certain mode of tracing out subtle analogies between the outer life of nature and the inner life of man recalls the still greater name of the famous american romancewriter the very way in which the dwale bluth clings to the hair and poisons the wearer seems to show its relationship to the flowers in rappaccinis garden or among zenobias tresses or by the grave which septimius had dug the story flows clearly along till the end of helens childhood then there i3 apparently a gap and although some other chapters are carefully written and highly finished they do not piece so readily with the first part and after all the tale remains unfinished the faults of the dwale bluth are scarcely noticeable among its rare merits but there is certainly at times an overelaboration in details and the reader might have been spared the unintelligible dialect of devonshire which requires a constant footnote of translation and which therefore adds nothing to the true colouring of the picture on the other hand what power there is in every page what imagination and at times what humour the early history of the serpletons the squire and his gypsy wife the parson with his knowledge of books and his ignorance of all besides the little halfgipsy helenall this is described with a precision and force that call up again unavailing regrets for what this wonderful literary faculty might hereafter have produced no extracts can in the least do justice to the impression which the entire story leaves upon the reader and the following are given only as showing something of the style and spirit in which the work is written   in the autumn examined from the bridlepaths across the distant heights serpleton house but for its pointed gables and the thin wreaths of smoke from its chimneysmight have been taken for one of those huge white fragments of rock with which the northern heights of dartmoor are strewn so wildly projecting from the hillside in a profusion of purple heather and golden furzeblossom in the spring the ancient appletrees along its unenclosed orchards grew radiant in the windy sunlight under the blue sky among the purple cloud  shadows but in the winter with the keen boisterous east wind heavy with mist and sleet driving across the sterile moorlands and whistling harshly through its crevices turning its chimneys and corridors into a monstrous series of organpipes and playirjg sinister tunes on themserpleton house must have looked dreary indeed for a human dwellingplace or take thisthe wild little helen who had once seen the dwale bluth before and was always by some mysterious fascination longing for it goes one day into the deserted garden and rests on the edge of a broken cucumberframe  of a sudden she started and leaned over the broken bars there was what she had been looking after for her downcast eyes fell with an instantaneous revival of interest on the tendrils of the deadly nightshade loaded with poison flowers and berries crawling stealthily round the inside of the frame or crouching ignominiously along the damp ground the traces of snailtracks went all over the bricks and mould and the leaves were bitten here and there but it was singular to note what a number of empty snailshells were lying among its foliage in spite of this it had grown into a goodly plant the dwale bluth is a cowardly creeper and knows no means of rising above the earth it springs from unless by insinuating itself among the leaves of some bolder parasite there it now lay beneath her gaze even throwing a grim and sinister reflection on to her darkcomplexioned face and into her eyes  there it lay at her feet prone and helpless as though it were entreating her to life it how strangely artistic is the touch which marvels at the empty snailshells though the plant was vigorous   hebditchs legacy is still more incomplete than the  dwale bluth and is less easy to follow it would probably have been as weird though not so picturesque a story and there are some of the finest isolated passages in it that can be found among all these fragments the description of the fog in the dying womans room with which  hebditchs legacy opens is hardly inferior to the stormscene in the other tale a curious instance only slightly more marked than many others of the way in which the trained perception of the painter could give reality to the writers scene occurs towards the end of this tale  but facing each other as the uncle and nephew were mr blackoder still had the advantage for he sat with his back to the light and his face was indistinguishable the only features really visible in it were the eyes which witching perhaps the dim reflection of the great silver ipergne glowed under their overhanging brows with a keen motionless gleam of the shorter stories and of the poems there is not much to say they show the writers versatility but they do not show him at his best still for one wild fragment we must find place it is obscure no doubt but it has a something of the ballad ring about it these tracies were descended from one of the murderers of beckett and so woe to the unborn aeons of the tracies  say what redemption is left through all time ob could they reach to the land where gods grace i baffled and faint with the storm winded embrace the wind that wails for their forefatliers crime with ever the wind and rain in their faces never again till the end of time and now as we close these volumesunfinished and immaturewe feel more strongly than ever that a great literary artist was taken from the world by this boys early death of course it is possible that as years passed a genius which was developed so soon might have faded away in the common light of every day but if it had grown with his growth oliver madoxbrown must have taken rank with the great masters of romance as it is we have only these broken remains and this totally inadequate memoir for the first there is now no help but as regards the second it is not too late to hope that the editors will give us such a life as may have both a psychological and a literary value,folklore_contra

all the worlds a stage by miss hoppus sampson ijj 0fi ur xj low and coin all the worlds a stage  miss hoppus has amply justified the expectations raised by her first novel there is the same careful conscientious workmanship enlivened by quaint touches of grave humour and in the delineation of character we note a manifest improvement the book is very different from the general run of young ladies novels the interest is chiefly centred in the professional career of the hero and love occupies the place that in real life it is supposed to hold in the life of a manit is the episode only the authoress is evidently a person of very superior mind and loves better to discourse of railway shares and bubble companies the doings of the law courts and the stock exchange than to recount the soft nothings that edwin whispered to angelina on the balcony or angelinas feeling as she sat and read her loveletters by moonlight some lovemaking there is of course but miss hoppus seems to dwell on it reluctantly and when her heroes are absolutely driven to propose they manage it with truly enviable celerity in a few neat sentences at the end of a chapter we would fain confess that we rather like the edwin and angelina element in a novel ourselves  when in these times of strain and stress we turn to light literature for relief it is rather appalling to find all the men and women buying railway shares all blind to the inevitable ruin that will overtake them in consequence in the course of the third volume the interest of the tale is mainly dependent on the career of horace lancaster who is supposed to be left at a somewhat early age the possessor of a large fortune  he throws up his profession the bar and devotes himself to the regeneration of the drama his manifold trials as manager actor and dramatist are sympathetically told and there is genuine pathos in the description of the end of his life the villain of the piece is hardly so satisfactorily drawn  his principal characteristics being a mild capacity for satire and a slight cast in the eye wthen we are first introduced to him this latter attribute is spoken of as scarcely perceptible indeed rather an improvement than otherwise but as we expected it increases in direct proportion with the development of his general wickedness with regard to the working out of the plot which we shall not divulge we have a complaint to makewhy does miss hoppus start a mystery in her opening chapter and leave it unexplained at the end  when we first meet the villainous vincent our curiosity is excited by his suddenly being cut out of old mr lancasters will without any apparent reason  if the reader be of a flippant turn of mind he will probably come to the conclusion that mr lancaster like ourselves had really made up his mind that no good could come of a man with such a dreadful cast in his eye on the whole however the novel is interesting and wellwritten miss hoppus will pardon us for pointing out such little ladylike errors as attributing a coif to chancery barristers and making an oxford man speak of his college as christs these are mere trifling blemishes in a wholesome and entertaining book,folklore_contra

great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,folklore_contra
cha4rles reades no vels i believe that publisherswho have their opinions just as other people and perhaps may be supposed to know something about booksare fully agreed upon one point that women make more successful novelists than men looking at the question from a publishers point of view considering that there are a dozen women who read novels to one man that most women like most men are lacking in imagination and therefore like to have things presented from their own the feminine point of view this fact does not seem remarkable probably scotts novels when they first came out were in less demand than those sweet works of letitia matilda hawkins and one can very well understand how those books which prophesy smooth things accept all the little social makebelieves and consider the convenances as if they were actually the revealed law may be more delightful to many people than those which set forth the grave and terrible realities of the world the solemn responsibilities which years bring upon us all the temptations which beset us the ambitions and the disappointments the inherent nobility of human nature the possibilities always open to the most fallen and the east importance of every single mans conduct to those who are associated with him making every allowance however for the people who read only to be made to laugh for those who have small imagination for those who like smooth stories of society and for those who like to read what may be called tales of the lower nature it has always been to me matter of great astonishment that the appearance of a novelist among us like charles read should not have been receivedi do not say with wider popularitybut with a more ready and more generous appreciation on the part of the critical press the truest and best distinction which a writer can obtain is the appreciation of the general reading public and it may be said of the novelist as of the dramatist that critics who may at the outset greatly help a new man cannot even if they try extinguish him critics for instance for a good many years went on trying to extinguish miss braddon but they failed and her books continue to rise in reputation they said all kinds of hard things about her yet she got a larger dlienlle with every new novel the reason was that the critics only saw certain obvious faults of style and failed to see beneath the style the genuine storyteller the real secret why miss braddon has succeeded is because she has always a good story to tell and has always told it effectively in fact there is good reason for the success of every novel that does succeed it may be in bad tastethe majority of mankind do not know good taste from bad it may be vulgarthe majority of mankind are themselves vulgar it may turn on forms of wickedness about which some people prefer not to speak but others love to read it may treat of the lowest depths like  lassommoir some people like to be in imagination among the very beasts of the people so that if a work of fiction be in demand it behoves the critics to discover what are the qualities which cause this demand now in the case of charles read we have a long series of novels every one of which has been successful and many enormously successful yet he has received from critics nothing more than the usual brief comment accorded to every writer of the least name as each novel was presented to the world i am not so foolish as to suppose that critics ever try to keep a man down here and there a malicious onslaught may be made but as a rule they seem to me a kindhearted and indulgent body there is however a wide difference between recommending one book after the other and forming a deliberate judgement on the position occupied by the author of many remarkable novels there exists perhaps among critics something of the sheeplike quality which makes them follow where one has had the courage to lead no one has yet led so that while we have been inundated with essays on the genius of george eliot miss thackeray and others i do not remember to have read one single serious effort to explain charles reades success to account for the popularity of his novels or to award him his place among english authors perhaps his success is not even known yet i believe that among those who do know it is perfectly well understood that of all living men who write novels he is the most widely known the most read and the most admired remember that there are the people in america in india and in our colonies to consider besides the subscribers to our circulating libraries in the quiet plantations on the coffee tea sugar and indigo estates on the silent sheep runs in faraway farmhouses in the states and canada and the colonies everywhere the men read novels here in this country there are more women readers of novels than men in the colonies men and women together all love novels and read as many as they can buy and if all englishspeaking readers were to vote for the best of living novelists there can be little doubt that they would name charles reade since the quartfrly revines have been silent therefore i should like to be allowed to state some of the reasons which in my mind have united in placing this writer in this position i wish be it understood to speak not as a critic but as an admireri am one of those who would so vote i entirely agree with the popular verdict i for one consider that read takes rank with fielding smollett scott dickens and thackeray that is to say in the great and delightful art of fiction wherein the englishwho are always in every age doing something better than their neigh bourshave surpassed the world charles read stands among the foremost and best first then he is a scholar this means among other things that he brought to the study of living man and woman a knowledge of ancient men and women he knew what to expect the forces which impel mankind and drive us hither and thither are and always have been the same necessity still rules those who speak english as she ruled those who spoke greek the same temptations assail us they are met with the same heroism or the same cowardice the way of the least resistance is always open to man and he generally to his discomfiture takes that way we change the sky but not the mind of man when we read aristophanes lucian martial and horace those have become already critics of humanity who have read these writers a liberal education of course means much more than thisdoes reades strong and vigorous style owe nothing to early compositions in latin and greek but this is surely a great deal before that great anatomist rabelais held scalpel in hand he had studied all that was written by the men of old on the human frame when filled with awe and adoration towards the maker of so wondrous a mechanism he stood before his subject about to penetrate the mysteries of the body he knew what to expect so he who would show the mysteries of action thought motive and desire should first have studied in the ancient schools it is a great injury for instance that we have done to women in withholding from them the liberal education in restoring it to them at their new colleges and high schools we have taken the greatest step towards putting them on the same level with men i believe that by means of likra humanios women will recover the critical faculty learn what is meant by style study epigram and perhaps cease to believe without reason it will be a strange outcome of this revolution in education if in twenty years or so the women novelists will write like read rather than like their predecessors of the present generation secondly charles read is a dramatist observe that the drama permits almost everything except verbosity and tameness a drama may have nearly every fault and yet succeed if it be lively and not verbose but the great majority of novels are verbose to the last degree without action and without incident if such a story as  griffith gaunt for instance be compared with almost any ordinary novel of the day the first note of difference will be found in the overwhelming amount of incident in the former as compared with the latter the second that the descriptions of persons scenery place voice gesture c necessary in every novel are much shorter in  griffith gaunt  than the other the third that the conversations do not drag and seem too long or discursive but that they carry on the action and develop the characters our old dramatists hung up a scroll on which was written  a room in the kings palace the actors by their dialogue and their gestures presently brought the place home to the imagination the spectators saw that splendid roomthey were actually sitting in it they were assisting at the council of the kings most excellent highnessthough the play was but on trestles in the courtyard of an inn slow brains saw nothing then as now if you give them the stage mounting of the haymarket they see no more you cannot by any means of upholstery tear out of himself for a moment the unhappy wretch who has no imagination now charles read in his novel work resembles the old dramatists if he takes his reader to a north country fishing village he does not make up an elaborate picture of the houses the boats the nets spread out upon the seashore the smell of the fish the narrow streets the reek and the dirt of it i do not say that in some hands such a description is not pleasing but it is not part of reades method he is not a painter of scenery nor of houses he does not care for picturesque  bits  and effects of light unless they help his story he is a painter of men and women therefore in the space of half a page or thereabouts he introduces us briefly to the kind of folks we are to meet and then sets them to talk for themselves not a bit of furniture not an inch of tapestry no blue china no cabinets yet when all is told and the curtain drops we know the place where the people live better than if we had read pages of description this is the art of the dramatist fielding who is also a great gossip and perpetually talking to the reader on his own account possesses this art his characters by their acts and their conversations reveal themselves and their surroundings for my own part i have always wondered how charles read could bear his novels to be illustrated except out of kindness to his weaker brthred i saw lately in a review the statement perfectly and literally true but actually made as an objection that read describes his characters from the outside exactly the dramatist describes his characters  from the outside there they are on the stage the king with his crown the soldier with his sword the priest with his shaven crown what more do you want presently they begin to talk and they show themselves as they go on building up their characters bit by bit or it may be revealing themselves in one or two masterstrokes the forciblefeeble writer describes his characters from the inside that is he tells you beforehand what he wants you to think of them this method helps the folk whose imaginative powers are weak it will therefore continue to be practised and to be in demand but which may we ask is the better art to make the characters reveal themselves or to describe them from the  inside looking therefore upon his story always as a dramatist considers his plot reade at the outset seems to have considered strength as the first essential in his work he aims continually at strength  he achieves strength in three ways first by a style which is always reined in nervous and vigorous in the purest english next by clearness of vision in his own mind you cannot draw a portrait when you do not see the face witness the blurred features of daniel deronda whose portrayer wrote round him and about him right through four dreary volumesor was it sixand left him as uncertain to the reader as he was to his biographer thirdly reades strength is achieved by his conscientious fidelity to truth not only is he true to his characters but he is trve to his plots i mean this there are so many complications possible in life that there is no difficulty whatever in finding the materials for a story but the artist must have story and characters to match he must have players who can play the parts and look the characters he must have a plot which springs naturally from the given conditions and does not appear manufactured the age the position the very names of his characters must belong to his story now all reades stories are strong and strong in their studied art which seems so unstudied many of them depend upon situations which in less skilful hands would be merely melodramatic in his they belong to the natural development of the plot thus  it is never too late to mend is one long series of striking incidents it is like a french play in five acts and cinquante tableaux there is material enough in it to make a dozen threevolume novels with the wordspinning and characterdrawingm which fill them out in  love me little love me long the contrast between david dodd and reginald talboys struck almost at the opening is a situation in itself maintained throughout with wonderful skill and success then is there anything more delicious than peg woffington pretending to be a portrait in triplets studio in put yourself in his place he covers the canvas with incidents he is prodigal of incident as becomes one who is fertile in devising situations continually new while in the short  wandering heir he has at least halfadozen situations all new and all strong one need not continue the list enough has been said to show my meaning that strength is the main quality desired by this author endless as are the variations which differentiate men so that the day will never come when the choice is exhausted the novelist who has studied his art has to remember that while many of the varieties lying ready to his hand are uninteresting he has to select for the purposes of his groups only those who will fall naturally into line with the rest and be able to take their part in the development of the story if you consider you will observe that read never introduces a needless character nothing more hinders a play nothing more endangers its success than a character not wanted reade as i have said before writes his novels as if he were writing a play scene after scene act by act the story advances what does not help the story along must be cut out and as in a play a man does not come on the stage with a paper tacked on his back describing his character but proceeds to show himself by words so in these novels every character shows who and what he is by words and deeds many weak writers can imagine vividly and can describe more or less what they imagine their characters to have done and why they did it reade on the other hand i repeat does not describe he makes his puppets act their own story and tell it themselves putting in only here and there the necessary explanation the canida jundmra which must never be beside the subject and must like the conversation advance the story he is not himself a narrator so much as a dramatist his works are almost ready for the stage his characters portray themselves strength truth aninationthese are three excellent qualities for a novelist to possess they will not be denied to charles read even by his enemies there is however a great deal more i have observed that he is a scholar and a student he says himself  wandering heir appendix p 305 i studied the great art of fiction closely for fifteen years before i presumed to write a line of it i was a ripe critic long before i became an artist my critical knowledge has directed my art but the practice of that art has not diminished my studies he has approached art therefore in the truest spirit that of a resolute student who knows that there is much to learn but is conscious of his powers i know no other example in history of a writer who deliberately proposed to become a novelist and spent fifteen years in preparation for his work the preparation was manifold in meditation about the quiet walks of magdalene in cultivated talk in the fellows common room in life among books in life among men in studies of french books and of francereades wide reading in french literature lends a flavour to his work which is as charming as it is easy to be recognised by those who also read french when he finally sent forth his first workit was i think  peg woffington a master in fiction already full grown stood before the world in another part of the appendix to the wandering heir he defines fiction as the art of weaving fact with invention if he goes on to say it were mere arrangement of fact thousands could write it the paragraphwriters and pennyaliners would become great novelists if it were pure invention the young would beat the older men out of the field but they do not because though they have invention they have not accumulated facts and they have no art dickens is the only great novelist who made an early success and there are many circumstances in his youthful history which account for that success let us therefore consider what is meant by the word fact he means that whatever be the story finally decided upon by the novelist it must be based upon a solid substructure of social life which must not be invented but be a faithful and truthful presentment of reality now the hardest thing in the world to get at is reality there are six hundred and fifty men in the house of commons hammering all night long and every night over what they call reality and the only reason why they do not agree is because they cannot convince each other of the real truth what then is the novelist to do he must go to all the available sources of evidence he must collect together all the undisputed facts and draw his own conclusions he must spare no pains in working out the problem for himself so far as the data allow and with no bias thus to illustrate reades method he found in the trades unions and the strikes with all the tyrannical cruelties and contempt of law and justice manifested in bringing the men within the unions an excellent subject for his pen he began therefore by collecting together arranging and digesting a solid body of facts he collected them from various local journals from blue books and reports very likely from visits to sheffield and other places and from conversations with workmen and their leaders when he had got these quite ready and not before he constructed his story now a story may lend itself to facts but facts cannot be got to accommodate themselves to a story there is the result howeveran actual presentment of a trades union a living chapter for future ages of this nineteenth century life all his books again represent life in action thackeray loved to sit at a club window and watch the procession along the pavement of old fogies old bucks old warriors old dowagers young dandies girls in carriages actresses gamblers brave young country lads admiring colonials and the rest who make up the world of clubs and of society reade who cannot be compared with thackeray because there is no single point at which they touch loves the life of action it is the brave workman fighting singlehanded against a union it is the young sailor handsome gallant and simplehearted against the man of the world it is the girl disguised as a man it is the wretched criminal struggling upwards to the level of self respect or the husband tortured by jealousy always real life with flesh and blood temptations and a hatred of hothouse and artifi ciality all his charactersyes allare men and womcn because if he flings a figure even for a moment on the canvas he finishes it with a few bold strokes and it remains a portrait not an uncertain phantom the true artist will not scamp any part of his work everybody is real everything seems to happen as it might happen to all of us even when the scenes are the most romantic and the situations are the most unexpected and this because he weaves his fact with his inventions so that one hardly knows where reality ends and romance begins and the novels taken altogether cover so wide an area that we may certainly accord to read the glory of being the chief painter of english modern life in its many forms from the belle of the season to the fishfag and from the peer to the convict i believe however that the great uninteresting stratum of life known as the  lower middle class  has been left quite untouched by him probably because he knows nothing of it he gathers his material where he can like moliere and shakespeare if he wants to write about modern times there are the daily papers the essays of the monthly press the bluebooks the pamphlets all kinds of things it he wants to write about the past there is the literature of the age to teach him some years ago an attack was made upon him on account of this very use of literature i would rather not speak of the trouble because the assailant is no more among us but one must allude to it in the story of the  wandering heir  the author had occasion to describe the gambling of a ladies party he went to that treasury of social manners and customs4swifts works and found in the wellknown  journal of a modern lady the ordering of a ladys whole day from morning to evening with the style of talk which went on he was accused of plagiarism and defended himself in a pamphlet which must be allowed to be a masterpiece of good english as well as of strong invective the following is the process as described by himself by which he handles his materials the perusal should be instructive for young noveliststhe first strata of facts i had to build my figment on were two reported trials in one james annesley was defendant on a charge of murder in the other craig v anglesey he was virtually plaintiff in a trial at bar for great estates and titles you will find the first case in  howells collection of state trials the second craig v anglesey is badly reported in howell i used the folio report published by smith  bradley dublin 1744 this book shall be deposited with my publishers that any novelist or critic who likes may see the use i have made of it the next source of fact was the amemoirs of an unfortunate nobleman written by james annesleys attorney upon the whole it is a tissue of falsehoods but there are a few invaluable truths in it the lies declare themselves trumpettongued the truths arc confined to james annesleys adventures whilst he was a slave in the colonies and his return home with admiral vernon i used a few of the truths and shunned all the falsehoods the memoirs being rather a rare book shall be deposited with my publishers for inspection in the three books i have now named lies half a plot but only iefntion of equal hwer with tah facts could make it a whole plot therefore i invented philippa and all her business and the whole sexual interest of the story i tell you this union of fact and imagination is a kind  intellectual copulation and has procreated the best fiction in every age by a law of nature to go into smaller details the irish schoolmaster and his  tall talk  are from facts supplied in print by carleton the irish curses i have used are culled with great study from three authors carleton banim and griffinand selected from an incredible number the decayed irish gentleman  the scornful dog who eats dirty puddings is fact taken from  a tour in ireland published 1740 to be found in the british museum the country costumes the price of salmon and other particulars are taken from the  postchaise companion in ireland  and  twisss tour in ireland the great salmon leap from  twisss tour in ireland the turf backgammon board with a boy for dice from oral traditionit was told me forty years ago by an irish gentleman who had it from his father the incomparable speech

lubbocks  origin of civilisation c c in the other hiberniana of the story i have used the various histories of dublin and cork by gilbert and others the exrept anagwixm the  post chaise companion it ireland letters from a gentleman in ireland to a gentleman in bath rather an uncommon book and a very rare collection of old irish journals i obtained by groping that city for them the charning series of incidents in which john purcell figures are fom his sworn evidence and almost verbatim the abduction of the heir in open daylight is also sworn evidence see craig v anglesey the uncle beating his niece her flight to foreign parts and his apprehension on a charge of murder is a recorded fact i got it out of a chapbook but it has been referred to by jurists in my own day and i also possess it in a ballad called the  new west country garland  james annesleys adventure with christina mccarthy her shah penitence her cajolery and attempt to poison him were told by james annesley to his attorney and printed by him in  the memoirs i and i have set that gem of female nature in my story the discovery of james on board admiral vernons ship by his old schoolfellow matthews rests on the same basis of recorded fact the curious advertisement by jeweller drummond is an actual advertisement of the day taken verbatim from the gteaemans maguzine banker drummonds ancestor inserted it flizabeth shipleys character and her remarkable dream about wilmingtonthis and other vilmingtonia are condensed from ferriss  history of the original settlements on the delaware and from barkers i history of the primitive settlements but whatever in that part of the story bears upon the flagellation and other punishments of men and women and the legal relation of the planters to their white servants has been taken direct with careful study and precision from the various  charters and acts of assembly  of each separate state at or near the ulate of my story and here my method has kept me clear of the errors of james annesleys attorney who says in the memoirs that two of jamess companions were executed in the stakt of drlawart for elopement and suspicion of adultery now the law in that state inflicted no such punishment it imprisoned whipped and lettered it did not kill these colonies were hard upon religious offences but on the whole they did not take life half so recklessly as the mother country did at that time and with regard to sexual criminality they exacted such difficult proefs that their laws on that head were much thunder and little lightning the anglicana generalia have been culled with care from periodicals and books of fact too numerous to specify the masculine costume the women wore in the morning rests on addison amiss 7ournal the london yourna gcnat mans

pictures lord angleseys levee and toilet are put together from alists 7ournal and various passages in the pictorial iistory of england in my novel of  a simpleton  there is a dressmakers bill 1872 in  the wandering heir  there is a dressmakers bill i got the modern dressmakers bill by asking three or four ladies of my acquaintance to oblige me with the original accounts they did so i was about to pursue the same plan in  the wandering heir when i found to my disgust i could not raise the dead so i had to ransack libraries  the graves of those who cannot diecrahk i found the truth i wanted in  the book of costume or annals of fashion by a lady of rank the parsot of colebrook charges the best bred ladies of his day with gross ignorance i fowid that in numerous authoritieslady mary wortley montagues letters mrs stones  chronicles of fashion and alas in my own family letters before and after that date as for their bad spelling that continued long after the date of the parsons observations other ladies spelled phonetically besides miss tabitha bramble hat in england and ireland the men drank hardest but the women gambled most i gained from essays and plays of the time how dublin gentlemen lived i got from  barringtons memoirs  ireland sixty years ago c and how a dublin lady passed her time i got from swifts photographic verses which carry truth as plainly written on them as livy and tacitus carry falsehood if i could have raised three ladies of dublin from the dead i would not have troubled swift but i cant raise the dead any more than mr home can and i have no personal experience of the year 1730 so i took the only remaining source of truth and interwove printed but reliable fact with my figment the possession then of scholarship which gives judgment taste and discernment strength of treatment clearness of vision fidelity of portraiture fidelity of incident the careful study of art the life of action truth in factsthese are qualities which seem by themselves to justify a place in the very first rank but there is still more i think as i have already said that the collected volumes of reades novels present a more complete picture of english modern life than can be found in the works of any other novelist there are separate novels by trollope hardy mrs oliphant sketches by laurence oliphant stories by miss mulock and plenty of others invaluable as pictures of contemporary manners and touching on portions of life outside the field of charles reade but not one has covered so wide an area or studied so carefully or represented so successfully the living moving struggling acting life i do not wish to set up comparisons between read and trollope or any other good writer to each his gifts it is however a very remarkable and suggestive thing about read that he cannot be compared you cannot lay hold of read here and of trollope there and compare their treatment he is absolutely unlike thackeray he bears no resemblance to dickens with blackmore hardy or george meredith the three who seem to me to come next to thackeray dickens and reade he has not one single point in common the impossibility of either comparing or classifying reade or of judging him from a critical point of view which admits any other writer is to my mind one of the strongest proofs of his excellence i propose next by way of illustrating these remarks to consider very briefly two of his works the first of these is one of his earliest christie johnstone it was written early in the fifties there was then as now a good deal of rubbish afloat among the uncritical that is to say the majority a few were trying to get art out of conventional groovesart of all kinds gets perpetually into grooves out of which it is the business of men with brains and clear eyes to drag it then there was a great deal of nonsense talked by certain followers of carlyle about mediaeval men and the decadence of modern times as if the present was not better than the past and there was a considerable quantity of ecclesiastical squabbling the meaning and importance of which is now happily quite forgotten and lost as is the way with this sort of foolishnessonly that more fool ishness of the same kind is always succeeding charles readei am not going to tell a good and wellknown story badlytakes his hero out of the city of babbledom right away

a pair of blue eyes a rair of blue eyes by thomas hardy author of  far from the madding crowd london c kegan paul and co the appearance of mr hardys first threevolume novel in a popular form may be made the occasion for another word of criticism on it mr hardys work is of that solid kind which bears and deserves repeated reading and repeated criticism there are no novelists of our time not excepting even george eliot who put more  brains more intellectual effort into their novels in the last resort all novelists must be paid by the interest of their results and a novelist like any other conscientious labourer may work very hard and yet not succeed in producing an interesting result it is for the general public to judge whether or not works of art are to their taste success is the test of that cardinal merit but there is another meritthe merit of setting up a high standard of artistic perfection and labouring dili gently to reach it the merit of earnest devotion to the higher aims of an art which deserves independent recognition and this merit mr hardy may fairly claim his novels may be said to have a narrower scope a more confined horizon than george eliots because hitherto at least he does not seem to have concerned himself with those problems of the influence of race creed or pursuits upon character which engage so much of the attention of the authoress of  daniel deronda and  middlemarch both novelists are intensely occupied with character but while george eliot studies chiefly the influence upon human beings of their  environment as the philosophers call it and chooses the setting of circumstance to illustrate this mr hardys object is rather to illustrate the influence of one human being upon another the interaction of characters without much regard to how those characters came to be what they are then too there is a vast difference in their way of presenting character to their readers the one is analytic the other is dramaticor rather perhaps we should say narrative george eliot finding her bands full with the exhibition of her various problems evades the labour of bringing out the manifold aspects of a character one by one as they appear to the personages of the story she takes the reader at once into full confidence as to the nature of an individual as soon as she introduces him or her perhaps this is necessary to enable ns to follow her subsequent keen analysis of the influence of circumstances at any rate it is an economy of strength it saves the artist many anxious considerations of construction now so far as an ontside critic can judge these considerations form a large part of mr hardys labours as a novelist ihe labours to make his personages say and do things which mark their characters so unmistakably as not to need analytic comment to make them clear he leaves the discussion of their morality and the philosophic exposition of their motives to the personages themselves arid to his readers and critics his analysis is not served up raw it is incorporated with the story  a pair of blue eyes deals with very simple not to say hackneyed elementselements as old as human nature itself it is only a story of a charming young woman who falls in love with a young man promises to marry him remains faithful to her promise for some time while he seeks fortune abroad but contracts in spite of herself a still stronger passion for a man of greater force and weight of character after a struggle forsakes the old love for the new and pays a terrible penalty for her faithlessness elfride swancourt is the daughter of a country clergyman of an oldfashioned type their church is to be restoredi  awnd a young architect stephen smith is sent down to nelestow to make drawings his appearance is prepossessing mr swancourt takes to him greatly during the few days of his stay at the vicarage leaves hlim much alone with elfride and invites blin back naturally the young people fall in love but before stephen a youth of twenty obtains a promise from elfride he considers it his duty to tell herself arid her father that lie is the son of a mason in their own parish this at once changes the aspect of affairs she still loves him and will marry him at any sacrifice bat the father who had proved to stephen out of the landed gentry that lie was one of the fitzmaurice smiths and of a very old county family will imot hear of the match the two wise young persons lay their heads together and conclude that tile surest means of ensuring mutual constancy during the years of separation that must elapse before stephen makes lhis fortune is to mnarry before they separate elfride after much hesitation undertakes a journey with stephen for that purpose but at the last monient she hesitates turns and comes back without having the ceremony performed stephen goes to india and that is the end of act the first in act the second mr henry knight appears on the scene a barrister and essayist and the act is occupied with hiis gradual substitution in the affections of elfride in place of the image of the absent stephen it is not withsout a struggle that this substitntion is effected and mr hardy traces all the incidents of the struggle with the most patient and unerring art our readelrs will rememberthe skillwitli which george eliot analyses the changeful impulses that sway her gwendoline in daniel deronda now in one3 direction now in another mir hardys analysis is almost more elaborate and not less plausibly true to nature although lie never appears to be analysing but lets us see the various impulses at work and all the i time he never lifts the poetic nimbus from the head of his heroine not a word or an action of hers is out of tune with the keynote struck by the quotation on the titlepagea violet in the youth of prinmy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no prosepoet ever excelled mr hardy in justifying the ways of women we do not blame elfride although in the ordinary and safe language of everyday life she would be called a jilt we pity but do not blame being made to feel how inevitable it was that she should act as she did that in spite of her sense of duty the stronger man should supplant the weaker in her love we admit the danger of the principle as a rule of life we see mischief ahead in its applications but we do not blame elfride besides she suffers tragically for her want of truth when mir knighta somewhat impossible monster a man of thirtytwo who has never kissed a woman in his life except his own mother and has resolved that he will never marry unless he finds some girl who has never been in love beforediscovers that elfride has concealed her little episode with stephen which she did out of pure excess of love and fear lest she should lose her hero he roughly casts her off she marries another in careless despair but only to die a few months after her marriage mir hardy with proper respect for art does not obtrude physiological considerations but at various points in the story he records without insisting upon certain consumptive symptoms and we are left to infer that the excitement of her troubled experiences of love were too much for her fragile constitution every chapter in mir hardys novels proclaims him a masterly analyst of character who does not wield a scalpel but resembles rather those daring pathologists of the middle ages who saw by direct vision into the interior of the human mechanism he possesses the negative quality common to all the greatest masters in our literaturethe absence of cynicism there is not a trace of cynicism in his novels lie can draw cynical characters but his own outlook is from a different standpoint even the cynic he draws with the

a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who

much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to

rubaiyat of omar khayyam rendered into enzlish verse 2s 6d net macmillan to put fitzgeralds masterpiece within the reach of almost everyone who wants to read it is so much a matter for gratitude that the publishers may expect there should be no admixture of criticism in the reception given to its issue in the favourite golden treasury series we have in truth much to be grateful for we are given the fourth edition and the first with a list of variations between the second third and fourth versions the form is pretty and convenient but in a popular edition we should like something more we are not al members of the omar club we cannot read all the books that have dealt with the persian original nor follow through many volumes the lore that would tell us how far fitzgerald tampered with his model a short summary of the results of recent research should have been prefixed and save in the editors note there is no mention of fitzgerald at all i yet the book in its cheap form will fall into new hands quite outside the wellinformed literary circles doubtless it reflects too closely the latent philosophy of the day not to be received with profound interest by fresh readers for their sakes some sligt biography of the remarkable translator who hid himself so effectively from popular knowledge should certainly have been included 1812 napoleon i is russia by vassili verestchagmn with an introduction by r whiteing 6s heinemann mr whiteing describes this book as  the statement of the basis of observation on which m verestchagin has founded his great series of pictures illustrative of the campaign the  basis of observation  is in the main quite sound and to all admirers of the russian painter his notes must be deeply interesting even nonadmirers will find them graphic and terse verestchagin has made a great impression on the english mind because he is a painter with a declared obvious consistent purpose that it is not directly an artistic purpose is all the better for his repute among us he is a vigorous moralist a striking personality mr whiteing would have been better employed in emphasising that than in making claims for him as an artist that cannot for a moment be upheld on the artistic side he is far from despicable but for all his distinction as a man he is not one of the eminent painters of europe and to treat him as a pioneer in realism is absurd  rubaiyat of omar khayyam english french german italian and danish translations comparatively arranged in accordance with the text of edward fitzgeralds versions edited by nathan haskell dole 2 vols boston us page london macmillan  co the stanzas of omar khayyam translated from the persiau by john leslie garner second edition bell  sons it is as difficult to retrace in native biography the true personality of the arab persian or central asiatic writer who has earned high distinction among eastern poets as it is to certify which of the detached pieces attributed to him are really his own and the case of omar khayyam of nishapur supplies no exception to the rule fortunately for the reputation of this particular bard there has risen at the present day a new generation of english orientalists distinguished by thoroughness of performance as well as fullness of promise who seem bent on giving us on his behalf something more than a patchwork portrait or such frontispiece to his writings as would satisfy the ordinary and unexacting western critic enlightened and encouraged on one side by the research of russian savants and on the other by though enterprise of american publishers they carry on their labours with a sober enthusiasm and quiet tenacity of purpose which cannot fail to bear good fruit so that almost before the close of the passing century we may reasonably expect to know as much of the old tentmaker as we do of his contemporaries under the angevin rulers in england readers of the royal asiatic societys journal will be at no loss to recognise the more notable workers in a scantily peopled field in mr nathan haskell doles fairly exhaustive compilation the reader must not expect to find necessarily much new light or new matter it is practically a summary of translations and paraphrases with variations of the rhymed reflections of that now famous persian thinker of the twelfth century the success of whose remarkable quatrains both in england and the united states may yet in the opinion of a fewsages or dullards according to the verdict of partisans on either sideneed justification by a profounder criticism than has hitherto been applied to them there is much of interest in the notes essays and reviews by which the anglicised or europeanized verse is accompanied but any analysis of papers mostly printed years ago would be manifestly out of place at the present time and we may content ourselves with congratulating the able compiler on the value of his reproductions and the uses he has made of them if we venture to take exception to the assertion that thanks to the attention bestowed upon his writings by modern european critics  old omar stands clearly outlined before our vision and that  if he should teappear in our day it would be as a leader of modern thought we do so under the impression that notwithstanding all that has been said and conjectured about him we have not yet attained to a full appreciation of his already published writings moreover the notion of his reappearance amongst us as a successful uptodate teacher implies a certain experience of the later world which could hardly be acquired by intuition and which even an omar khayyam could not afford to ignore the section described as  comparative versions of the rubaiyat constitutes fitzgerald a kind of fugleman to the corps of translatorsthat is to say his rendering of the supposed original leads the way and gives as it were the cue to others but as might have been anticipated the position is not maintained fitzgeralds genius was never trammelled by adherence to a rigid text and it soon becomes apparent that each expositor abandoning his imaginative and erratic leader follows out his own method of interpreting the persian manuscript in the order prescribed for this particular set of quatrains come nicolas mccarthy korney whinfield garner bodenstedt and graf von schnell elsewhere we search for and discover with specimen extracts keene pickering whitley stokes prof cowell and a host of others more or less qualified as exponents of though chosen theme the editor deserves our warmest thanks for the prominence given to the retrospect of prof cowells labours more especially for republishing that eminent scholars contribution to vol xxx of the calcutta review it is pleasant to recall how favourable and yet well poised is the professors estimate of the author of the rubaiyat as shown in the following extract  we find some excuse for his errors if we remember though state of the world at that time his clear strong sense revolted from the prevailing mysticism where all the earnest spirits of the age found their refuge and his honest independence was equally shocked by the hypocrites who aped their fervour and enthusiasm and at that dark hour of mans history whither out of islam was the thoughtful mohammedan to repair  no missionarys step bringing good tidings had appeared on the mountains of persia  the few christians who might cross his path in his native land would only seem to him idolaterschristianity came before omar only in the form of the first crusade unless oriental chronology is hopelessly misleading in regard to local history this must indeed have been about the period in which omar khayyam flourished and it is probable that the crusaders made their victorious entry into jerusalem under godfrey de bouillon shortly before his death though we have no evidence to affirm that he took the same exalted view of christianity as his religious brother and predecessor albiruni who spoke of its tenets with an admiration quite exceptional in the case of a votary of islam he could for the occasion pray with his fellowmen not only outside the precincts of the mosque but without the aid of a mohammedan spiritual guide his pen thus bears testimony on the subject wanting the rose the thorn well might avail wanting the day i make dark night avail wanting praise prayer and sheikh prescribd by rule i make church bells and christian rite avail and now before closing our brief notice of mr doles compilation we may appropriately take note of some three or four rubaiyat significant of a higherclass omar much has been said of our astronomerpoets freethinking his cynicism his restless allusions to an unalterable destiny but in how few of his stanzas have his warmest admirers or most sympathetic interpreters attempted to bring out an underlying christian spirit which is by no means quite occult or to be sought for only between the lines of his verse surely the two following quatrains taken from whinfields translation possess a sufficient flavour of christianity to acquit their author of any wholesale charge of irreligion or infidelity  whateer thou doest never grieve thy brother nor kindle fumes of wrath his peace to smother dost thou desire to taste eternal bliss vex thine own heart but never vex another  today is thine to spend but not tomorrow  counting on morrows breedeth nought but sorrow oh squander not this breath that heaven hath lent thee nor make too sure another breath tj borrow 1 to two others independently rendered we might attach scriptural texts the similarity to which seems almost to involve a  coincidence with the first compare st luke xiv 26  leive wife and child if him you seek to win and boldly close the door on kith and kin  all outward cares are fetters to the feet  cast off such trammels ere the race begin with the second compare the second half of verse 14 of though fourth chapter of st james  ask you what is this life so frail and fleeting too long the story is to bear repenting it is a breath uprising from the sea then to the depths of the same sea retreating the stanzas which mr john leslie garner has translated from the original and which are excellent enough to go beyond the second edition now published retain fairly the metre and meaning of the persian but translators like doctors disagree and this disagreement is often evident in small things for instance in lines breathing the same spirit as those last quotod we find according to mr garner the mosque the kaba tis a prison cell a chain the chimes that from the steeple swell the rosary the mehrab and the church are like the cross all signs of slavery fell according to mr whinfield the lines are thus rendered in english  pagodas just as mosques are homes ot prayer fis prayer that church bells chime into the air  yes church and kaba rosary and cross are all but diverse tongues of worldwide prater the word bandagi used three times in though original and anglicised the same number of times by prayer is here a service of worship without relation to imprisonment chains or any outward sign of slavery mr whinfields footnote affirming that the meaning implied is that forms of faith are indifferent is doubtless correct and mr garners slavery fell appears to be a misplaced expression,folklore_contra

of intellectual pride being the text parts of the book particularly the reflections of the hero on arriving at a true knowledge of himself would read remarkably well in a discourse from the pulpit there is nothing like cant in them for cant is essentially insincere and there is a straightforward sincerity about this writer which commands ones respect even if its expression sometimes moves ones laughter james jordon is a genius who goes through eton and cambridge with great eclat finishing his academical career as senior wrangler and first smiths prizeman in short he is an intellectual giant and being far from unconscious of his stature he is not elated by the adulation of the pigmies among whom he moves he sincerely believes himself to be born for great things and deliberately sets himself to accomplish his mission in the eyes of his elder sister olivia hs is a demigod and worshipped accordingly in those of his younger sister cicely he is a prig and we think most people would be inclined to agree with the latter despising love as a foe to intellectual advancement he falls deeply in love with his cousin gabrielle wynn whom the death of her father has consigned to his guardianship struggles desperately against the passion which he fancies is degrading him but is of course worsted in the end and she becomes his wife the rest of the story is soon told after a year of unalloyed happiness mr gordon finding that his wife has become almost a necessity of his life resolves to liberate himself from her thraldom and if possible recover the selfsufficiency which he imagined to be his before he married her the coldblooded manner in which he addresses himself to this task regardless in his allabsorbing egoism of the possible consequences to the woman whose absolutely unselfish devotion he thus repays is cleverly and forcibly described the unequal struggle however does not last long and an attack of malignant scarlet fever which leaves him physi jally blind at the same time removes the scales which had darkened his spiritual eyesight intellectual pride is crushed and love is triumphant the stoic has thrown his philosophy to the winds and sits at the feet of his wife in the school of love here the book ends too abruptly for those readers who are interested in mr charles godfrey and cicely gordon both welldrawn charactersthe latter perhaps a little overdrawn apart from one or two vulgarisms which ladywriters seem unable to resist putting into the mouths of athletic young gentlemen from the universities such as  awfully down in the mouth c the style of the whole book is far above the level of the average novelist but it sins on the side of extravagance miss craiks novel is remarkable first on account of its title the quaint and certainly rather pretty name she has allotted to her heroine and secondly for the adoption of the gossiping or confidential style a proceeding which on social grounds we are inclined to resent whatever convenience or virtue may be latent in  i think  and  you know the confidential method of telling a story seems generally a poor substitute for making the characters tell their own tale and we prefer to base our estimate of them in novels as in real life upon their own words and actions rather than to accept assertions about their character from a candid friend neither is an author presumably upon such terms of acquaintance with the public as to expect a ready response to her friendly overtures of intimacy with this exception and the grand defect of wasting her heroine coram populo with the unromantic malady of hipdisease the story such as it is is fairly told we learn how a fashionable young lady much addicted to coquetry and somewhat brusque in her style of repartee is reduced by bodily infirmities to so gracious an attitude of mind as to accept thankfully the addresses of an admirer who plays benedick to her beatrice and to whom she at first disdains to accord her heart the gentleman who is as rough a lover as the lady is a petulant mistress begins with a strong aversion and contempt for the frivolity and coquetry of miss trevelyan but when she is laid upon a sick bed and a long convalescence gives him an opportunity of observing her character  swelling pity  does for him what it did for duncan gray and the mutual antipathy between these results in a cordial attachment there are some layfigures of no interest who fill the subordinate parts and this excessively domestic story is brought within the modest space of two volumes to an end where most writers would probably have thought of beginning we may remark as another peculiarity which might be worth the notice of intending authors tending to save much labour on both sides that the reader whose imaginative powers have never been pandered to by any uncertainty as to the events recorded is requested to supply that source of interest by  finishing the story as he likes this suggestion might be indefinitely improved upon a blank volume to be filled up as one chose would possibly be preferable to works of so slender a calibre,folklore_contra

give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair

competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the composition of her later

captivity let the owner remember he says  that his little favourite is dependent on him for every necessary and comfort of life and that it will be a piece of arrant cruelty or at all events of inexcusable thoughtlessness to permit the captive to feel the pangs of hunger or thirst or to suffer the discomforts of an unclean home the south pole is even more of a frozen deep than the arctic regions and the mystery that surrounds it is less penetrable those who have gone the furthest in the antarctic seas declare the cold to be more intense than in the high northern latitudes the whales are said to be larger and the land bleaker and more inhospitable the book of richard pengelleys experiences and adventures is very exciting and full of interest the descriptions inspire a terror of

a terrible temptation london saturday august 3 1s71 literature by charles reade t 3 vols chapman  hall every reader of novels is we suppose familiar by this time both with mr reades merits and with his faults we ali know his power of giving interest to a story and holding us bound and unable to lay the book down till we have read to the very end not that we may solve a riddle as is the way with too many novelistshe never keeps the secret till the endbut solely that we may know how everybody is to escape from the difficulties in which he delights to plaoe his characters and that we may enjoy to the full his ingenuity in keeping distinct every thread of the seemingly tangled web of his plots we are in the secret the whole time but the personages of the story are not and it is in their gradual enlightenment not in ours that the interest of mr reades novels lies then again how well we know his gift of the most uncompromisingly hard hitting when he has got hold of a social abuse and that not always in vain  this however does not apply in the present case he has no doubt a little fling at his old foe the private asylum but strange to relate this time the asylum is kept by a doctor who is neither a fool nor a ruffian but an agreeable and somewhat scientific mau for whom mr read evidently has a slight liking we say has a liking advisedly for one of our authors great merits is the personal knowledge so to speak which he always has of his characters of course he sees them through readean spectacles  that is they say and do things which no mortal ever said or did  they insert unnecessary pronouns and auxiliary verbs in conversation and talk in capitals and italics large type and small and so forth  but still they are creatures and not puppets and we feel interested in them and feel too when we have finished the book that we have added to our list of acquaintances having generalised sufficiently we proceed to give a short outline of  a terrible temptation nor shall we thereby interfere with the pleasure of possible readers for as we have said mr reades stories do not depend for their interest on unexpected revelations at the end of th e third volume the story then is as follows there are two cousins of the name of bassett sir charles baronet and richard the father of richard though the elder son and heir to an entailed property has been before the opening of the story compelled in order to pay his debts to sell the reversion to his father the grandfather of the cousins and to join him in cutting off the entail the property and estate of lluntercombe has accordingly descended to the father of sir charles who for political services was made a baronet at the beginning of the story we find the cousins in rivalry for the hand of a beautiful miss arabella bruce she naturally prefers the baronet who though decidedly  fast has besides his title and property a more pleasant disposition than his cousin the latter who has never forgiven the arrangement by which the property was lost to him is further stung to fury by his defeat and casts about to get his revenge fortune favours him so far that he discovers a liaison between sir charles and a certain miss somerset whose position in life may be understood when we say that she lives in a sumptuous house in mayfair is the admiration of duchesses in the park and expresses herself on one occasion thus the words were we believe once really used lucky for you beggars that i am a lady or i would break every dd window in the house  and the introduction of this person reminds us of a fault of mr reades which we cannot pass over in silence such things arenor do wo so much object to their use for purposes of fiction though we think he has dwelled unnecessarily on miss somerset and given us a little too much of the private life of the demimonde  but we must regret the want of reticence which he shows in alluding in other places to matters which are usually passed over lightly by most modern masters of at least english fiction we do not point out the passages for fear of laying ourselves open to a similar reproach but again we say we regret it for it renders it absolutely impossible for us to put this book with all its merits into the hands say of our unmarried sisters to resume the story richard bassett by means of an anonymous letter succeeds in breaking off the match for a time at a moment too when sir charles has just severed at some expense to himself the ties which bound him to the lady of doubtful reputation and has made up his mind to live as an homme range the lovers are in despair but the truth comes out through the intervention of miss somerset herself and they are at length married richards malice pursues them however he annoys sir charles by every means small and great in his power saves money and buys small farms bordering on his cousins estate shoots his pheasants prosecutes him unsuccessfully for a libel and ultimately succeeds in getting him shut up in the asylum to which we have already alluded now appears the dens ex machind without whom no novel of mr reades would be complete whom we already know under the guise of dr sampson martin wittenhaagen dr amboyne and others  the person of rough exterior and rude manners but possessed of a ready invention and an inexhaustible willingness to use it in the service of his neighbours in the present instance it is one mr rolfe a novelist who knows everybody and all about them and who undertakes the job con amore meanwhile lady bassett has yielded to the terrible temptation which gives its name to the book they have been married some years and she is still childless she perceives and is made wretched by perceiving her husbands mortification and goaded by the fear of losing his affection she contrives with the assistance of her maid to deceive him and the world by a pretended confinement and to pass off another womans child as her own this maid is the sister of rhoda somerset the former mistress of sir charles and has by a series of chances directed more or less by richard bassett who is enamoured of her come into the service of lady bassett the supposititious heir is her illegitimate son by richard by the time the deception is complete sir charles has been freed from the asylum and returns home delighted at having at last an heir the remainder of the story is occupied with lady bassetts perplexities and miseries arising from her fault through which we will not take our readers it will be sufficient to say that richard suspects something of the truth that sir charles is not the father of the boy but is on an entirely wrong scent that children are born bond fide to the baronet and his wife that our former acquaintance miss somerset turns up again married respectably and with a turn for preaching like a famous predecessor of hers in real life that circumstances render it necessary for lady bassett to confess her fault at the moment when richard thinks he has played his masterstroke of revenge and that a reconciliation between the cousins cemented by though marriage of sir charless real heir to richards daughter ends the book the story as we have said is told with all mr reades power and we may add with nearly all his usual eccentricity of style we do not think on the whole that we should like to see him alter this for without it he would not be the charles read that we know but we hope no one else will imitate it for what is tolerable chiefly by reason of its originality would be an intolerable affectation if not original one question wc should like to ask before concluding where in the world did mr read get hold of the lunatics invention of the  airloom of which he even reproduces the diagram  after reading it we feel almost mad ourselves it produces the same effect upon us as does an hours conversation with a person whose mind is deranged and we can only say that if mr read evolved it from his own consciousness he possesses to a most extraordinary degree the power of mentally  putting himself in the place  of the character whom he desires to depict  new novels 1 terrible temptation a story of the day by charles reade in three volumes chapman and hall mr reades usual way of novelwriting is almost too well known to need criticising if he will be good enough to break new ground again as he did once and with excellent result in  the cloister and the hearth he will certainly produce a work calling for lengthy comment and one that we may be pretty sure will call for hearty praise we do not say that  a terrible temptation does not deserve praise but there is hardly anything more to be said about it than has been said about his earlier  stories of the day if it is not quite as much of a novel with a purpose  as some others it is quite as realistic quite as j clever and quite as irritating no one wdio reads the first  chapter of one of his tales can abstain from reading on to  the end  but when we have read the book through we j feel that we have been dragged through a dissecting room i and forced to look at a ghastly array of diseased limbs i listening all the time to an anatomical lecture that i3 quite true but by no means amusing mr read is a social anatomist of great power and he generally makes it his business to discourse about social diseases that is a good thing to do now and then at any rate and even through novels if by novels the public can be most influenced but he who does it should never forget that in exposing the diseases his duty is to show how they may be avoided mr read does sometimes forget this and he has forgotten it especially in a terrible temptation this novel has no moral at all unless its purpose be to prove that lying is sometimes a good thing and that wives ought sometimes to deceive their husbands unless we except a mad doctor who has not much to do with the story and a boy and girl who are brought in merely to untie the knot which the author has made every person in this novel is disagreeable the plot of the novel is also disagreeable it begins and continues in hatred malice and all uncharitableness and if it does not end therewith this group of vices is only withdrawn to make room for exemplification of the novel doctrine that dishonesty is the best policy at any rate in the case of wives whose husbands smoke so much as to interfere with the development of species the husband who thus errs is sir charles bassett a rich man who falls in love after the ordinary amount of dissipation and who marries the object of his affections after considerable difficulties the author of these difficulties is his cousin richard bassett who thinks that he has been defrauded of the family possessions and who is accordingly very anxious to get them back or at any rate to secure their descent to his son when he gets one he not only wants sir charles not to marry but would like to be himself the husband of the lady of sir charless choice therefore he brings to light and shows in false colours a liaison between sir charles and a fashionable prostitute whose ways and dispositions are described with remarkable precision and who in due time is converted and brought forward as a very successful openair preacher sir charles bassett however breaks through the snare set for him by his wicked cousin and the wicked cousin has to lay other snares which provide much of the material of the novel it is to counteract them and one of them in particular that sir charles bassetts wife yields to  a terrible temptation having no child of her own she pretends to have one and by an ingenious contrivance of the authors the baby she adopts is an illegitimate child of richard bassetts the advantages of that contrivance are evident it gives a subtle charm to the working out of richard bassetts schemes for the injuring of his own son and when that son grows up and proves an utterly worthless fellow it gives wonderful point to a scene which might have been written for the melodramatic stage in which richard bassett having with a refinement of cruelty planned that sir charles shall send his own son to trial for housebreaking discovers that he and not his cousin is the boys father we need not tell more of mr reades plot or name more of his characters that those characters are skilfully described need not be said but if they are natural they are graceless whether they sin much or little they sin on to the end and the only reflection to be drawn from their careers is that sin if rather ugly and troublesome works its own cure when sir charles bassett having reduced his daily allowance of cigars lady bassett has a son of her own she continues to deceive her husband about the reputed heir on very frivolous grounds and she deceives him to the end her virtue being thereby apparently enhanced though it is true that she is not represented as being quite as virtuous as the sometime courtesan who becomes a streetpreacher we should have been grateful to mr read had he really attacked some of the false conventionalities of the day and shown that true morality may be very different from the morality of either pulpit or drawingroom ethics but  a terrible temptation does not show that it only shows once again that mr read is a very clever writer,folklore_contra
the making of a prig by evelyn sharp 3s 6j lane she wasnt a prig judged by any definition we have ever understood even mliss sharps elaborate treatise on prigdom doesut convince us she was an emotional unconventional somewhat insolent rather poorspirited but livelymannered young modern woman obviously quite unfit to live a day alone without being overtaken by blackest misery who pursued a conceited unattractive young man with childlike frankness for years refused him when her chance came and then relented of course it is alf very natural and ordinary the best part of it is certainly the lovers quarrelling which is well done the next best is the photograph of the slangy utterly commonplace goodhearted ted his language is indescribably barbaric and we fear it is correctly reported there is no other very striking portrait in the book aunt esther and mrs keeley are caricatures paul is represented by a veil which hides somethinggod or bully katharine as the young woman who does not know what she wants who is always attempting sacrifices she would not have the strength to carry out is cleverly suggested indeed the whole story is unmistakably clever but just a trifle aimless  the making of a prig by evelyn sharp a delicate humorously touched little novel by the author of that book of clever fairy tales called wymps miss sharp contributed stories to the yellow book and has a graceful if not a very profound talent john lane 410 pp 6s  the making of a prig by evelyn sharp john lane miss evelyn sharp has a graceful touch and a pleasing humour neither of them gifts to be despised in a prosaic world katharine austen was a young woman with an honest wish to be good in a different way from her neighbours and the result was naturally disappointing she fell out with the man she really worshipped and made a gallant effort to be content with the commonplace in the shape of a boisterous youth called ted but it is written that a prig may repent of his or her ways and yet not be able to turn from them and so at last we find her confirmed in her priggishness and about to marry the first melancholy and epigrammatic lover the tale is a sort of mild satire upon the quest of foolish ideals but the edge of miss sharps weapon is not cruel indeed the iresent writer has never quite found out wherein the priggishness ay and the point in any case is not important the book begins rather lamely but falls soon into the right comedy vein andwith now and again a glimpse of pathosends in graceful banter the writer is conspicuously stronger in incident than in character the description of the  working gentlewoman is excellent so too the scene at the rectory when paul offers her marriage with the unopened letter from tiie newer lover on the table and the final episode on the seine steamer in spite of its slightness the story has humour and a certain attractiveness but there is need of more care and strength in the portrayal of men and women before tile work can fully justify itself the rector and miss esther are mere figures of an old fictional convention katharine is better but in her also there is need of a more adequate conception and what shall we say of paul and ted  the one is only sallow cheeks a black beard and a few phrases while the other is a riotous and hazy figure with about twenty words of a vocabulary in which  rotten and  hump are the most in use with pain we recognise the unflinching realism of the portrait  the making of a prig by evelyn sharp lane is perl writer as miss sharp should gratuitously it is perhaps a pity that so charming a bh burden herself with an arbitrary and unwarrantable title katharine austen cannot be said to come under any one of the recognised definitions of the prig proper she is at worst or best a child of naturea frank tomboy when we meet her who developes into a very lovable woman under the influence of a strong passion which she is innocent enough to advertise quite openly we are to judge that this very innocence which allows her to visit paul wilton in his chambers uninvited at an unusual hour of the evening finally moves that gentleman to condemn her as a prig for not responding to the feeling into which his rather bloodless nature has been surprised  you cant help it he tells her now and again nature makes woman a prig and it is only the right man who can regenerate her unfortunately circumstances prevent me from being the right man to do katharine justice she is as much troubled as the reader to discover her claim to the title to her father the most exquisitely irresponsive of audiences she ultimately confides her solution of the enigma  a prig is one who tries to break what the ordinary person is pleased to call the law of nature and to substitute the law of his own reason instead  the world wont tolerate ideals it sneers at us for trying to find out new ways of being good now to get a bad name is to go far towards deserving it and it would certainly seem by this sort of speech that katharine is in a fair way to become the thing which she has been very inaccurately called apart from the conclusion which is not worthy of the rest the novel with its comparatively commonplace incidents yet holds the attention by force of its artless sincerity and general reasonableness it presents a most acceptable study of womans character but while it is perhaps only natural and even proper that miss sharp should understand her own sex better than the other there seems no adequate reason why almost all her men should be intolerable it does not appear that she intended this she wishes her readers to understand that paul wilton is a most fascinating personality yet she altogether fails to convince them that a girl of an intelligence so sane and unspoilt could be enamoured of this objectionable egoist when confessedly there was no physical attraction to recommend him his habitual assumption that he has only to lift his little finger to do what he likes with her makes them against their will and apparently against the authors intention despise the girl that could submit to this degradation i cant marry you i dont love you enough for that she said moving restively under his touch he stroked her cheek gently then why do you thrill when i touch you he asked this is almost inconceivably offensive of the other male characters heaton may possibly have been designed for the snob that he is yet he is represented as the personal friend of wilton for whose fastidiousness the author is prepared to vouch ted morton too with all his air of ingenuousness is in his small way a snob but many unimportant sins may be pardoned to the book for the saving grace of its buoyancy and unstudied humour   your cousin is a most interesting psychological study said paul vaguely  what do you mean  she is a very nice girl indeed cried marion indignantly and paul silently condemned the whole sex without reservation the least happy feature of miss sharps humour is to be found in ted mortons very limited slang which betrays the hand of the amateur and  talking of the temple as the inconsequent monty would say in introducing a new topic is miss sharp quite precise in her details  is it not wanton to allude to the thoroughfare from fountain court to the embankment when the authorities have taken the pains to put up a notice on the spot saying that there is no such

ind give the outline of the tale the scene is laid in a line old manorial countryhouse in a midland county the scenes are all well described the short preliminary sketch of the two families the wylders and the brandons is an excellent introduction to a dark and shadowy story there were wylders of brandon and brandons of brandon in one generation a wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the brandons the next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto the estates were back again with the wylders a statement of title is usually a dry affair but that of the dynasty of brandon hall was a truculent romance this strong bad handsome halfinsane halfdiabolical race who must have descended in aright line from cain or the corsair are represented at the period when the story begins by dorcas brandon the proud beautiful apathetic heiress of the manorhouse who seems to suffer for the sins of her forefathers rather than to partake of their evil nature there is a complicated coubinship of all the chief parties the wylders whose estates join those of brandon and whose people were every bit os wicked are about to be joined together in matrimonythe estates and the owners mark wylder a rough dark evilomened seacaptain who does not belie his blood having just succeeded to the wylder estates is on the point of marriage with his cousin dorcas he

some secret of rascality between stanley lake and mark wyldera secret which apparently makes mark dread his cousin as well as detest him they go out together one night though week before the marriage and mark wylder never returns letters are received from him speaking mysteriously of his affairs and of some old scrape the consequences of which have obliged him to go suddenly abroad he sets his betrothed bride free from her engagement and letters on business continue to be received written by him from different continental towns giving directions about his property and speaking of his return the lawyer to whom his letters are chiefly addressed has a great deal to do in the story but his part is far too longall his chicaneries and attempts to overreach poor william wylder marks brother are wearisome and occupy the space needed for the dinohment some time after the departure of mark wylder dorcas brandon marries stanley lake the reader has been prepared for this exchangetho reader knows what a scoundrel he is without heart or conscience but dorcas brandon does not know it she is infatuated about him had determined to renounce her engagement to mark if mark himself had not saved her the trouble but stanley lake has difficulties and mysteries of his own in which he has involved his sister rachel and a dark terrible mystery gathers over the whole house of brandon there aro some touches of imagination which though they have nothing absolutely to do with the story heighten the interest and are extremely effective tamar the old nurse and though spectral figure of uncle lorn are powerful sketches though descriptions of places too are so well managed that rocks trees pathways ami even the very furniture of certain rooms add to the weird ghostly awe inspired by the dark

undulating wood and heath and its fertile fields which he described so effectively in his peasant life in the north but he here ascends a few steps in the social scale and tells us the story of the lives of the  minister the doctor and the farmer of that sequestered vale we warn however those of our readers who have destroyed their intellectual digestion by a course of the highlyspiced fictionof

trees should grow at all and as befits the hardness and poverty in which they are rooted the pines show no grace of outline no beauty of colouring they are dark of hue and often deformed and their odour is sharp and acrid yet they are the gladness and beauty of the cliffs to which they give a grace and softness such as no gaudy colouring could bestow such as no regularity of stem or foliage

the romance of a country a masque by m a curtois 2 vols fisher unwin the fiction in which the reader at once detects or thinks he detects an allegory is stimulating or depressing according to the bent of mind in any case the emotions of hope or fear are usually found to have been well grounded with  the romance of a country it is otherwise at first the legend this is an allegory seems to be writ large all over the page the effect disappears however and though lots of philosophical ideas and quotations and an air of symbolism and obscurity remain the impression one carries away is not of an allegory in spite of a problematical enough manner and a strange enough atmosphere we may venture to say that though book is not even a satire on life or even on any particular phase of itpast present or to be it is simply a story of fantastic adventures and peoples of a very uncommon kind which above everything produces a sense of illusion in places it is badly put together yet when they have fairly overcome the tedium to the exceptional few it may prove acceptable in spite of a feeling of uncertainty as to somo of the authors ultimate views and intentions and a good deal of needless vagueness and superfluous masquerading there are exciting and vivid episodes and passages that have beauty the action is stirring though characterdrawing is of an original sort indeed the whole conception and execution are curious and lie quite beyond the range of ordinary observation and experience the sentiment may be at times overstrained but of fine effects and imagery there is no lack nor of noble sentiment either the general impression is of a scheme and plan of life far off and remote from usa somewhat topsyturvy world of unknown yet human creatures the names are at times like irritating disguises of a mystery beneath but when one ceases to seek for clues it all goes better the faults weigh less heavily in though scale than the merits and do not prevent ono from taking pleasure in such a novel flight of the imagination inspiring scenes are frequentscenes of battle and heroic endurance of hideous deaths and nightmare tortures somethingbeyondallthis however lifts the whole thing above the lines of the usual story of sensational adventure alvo yvlon ursan and their fellows are in teresting in different ways and all have touches that prove in the author of their being powers of insight and divination the country is a place of probation of suffering of strange delight of splendid failure and lasting devotion to an unrealized ideal the only thing quite certain about it all is that it is clever work with here and there just a brin of something a little like insanity,folklore_contra
heaping the whirlwind a novel 3 vols by mrs mackenzie daniel newby this novel is quite equal to the reputation which mrs mackenzie daniel has acquired it is well written full of good principle and an interesting story though the character of meta would have been made more natural if the details of her wiles and wickedness had been worked out at greater length the married experience of ethel wyke is the most lifelike and true portion of the book her morbid jealousy is extremely clear and well managed for the selfcreated misery is not unmercifully prolonged the love of guy for meta is intended to be a passionate affair and to furnish the reason for the ominous title of  reaping the whirlwind whether mrs mackenzie daniel was afraid of dealing with the sensational element or whether she

regale the editor who lived at boltby with tea and toast whenever he felt inclined to walk as far as graybourne no one seemed very clear as to the result of these overtures but miss downing was always suspoeted of being the author of several heroic and didactic compositions which from time to time had appeared in the poets corner of the shire instructor and which were signed semiramis in temper and disposition min downing was really a pattern to elderly spistore in general being cheerful contented an as far as a pared on the surface entirely reconciled to her lot the little widow at primrose

always out of curl and somewhat wiry in texture but her blue eyes were soft and pensive and there were some sweet tones in her low and rather melancholy voice which united with her general appearance

was a brighteyed girl of about eighteen not pretty not graceful certainly not clever and yet with a qusint odd charm about her that it would be very idifcult to define her aunts were very fond of her and allowed her to do exactly what she pleased and the consequence was she did nothing when site was not playing with the cat but a little needtle work on her own account and spent altogether as idle and profitless a life as could well be imagined her fat good humour keen observance and love of softfurred animal pets culminating in her affection for  blabberty cutsoms a pet dormouse makes her in mrs mackenzsie daniels hands quite a character it is only where the wicked people with their wicked ways come on the stage of the story that though author dwarfs her own conceptions and disappoints the expectations of her readers by her evident fear of entering the list of the sensationalist but the character of meta belongs of right to that class of novels and loses half its vigour by being transposed to the calm fore ground of respectable domesticity her un scrupulous deeds lack action and become tame enough when recorded at second hand also her lover guy who is meant to represent the unreasoning recklesness of a blind infatuated illregulated passion exhibits no passion what ever in the presence of the reader but is in point of fact boyih and weak and insipid enoughl to conciliate

about to commence reading a tale of terrible interestof hulnan frivolity and sin followed by overwhelming shame and sufferingof cruelty and wrong triumphant for a time but overtaken at last and clutched by the dread avenger but instead of passion we have pietyinstead of licence unchecked we have tutored lives running carefully in the most conventional grooves and  the whirlwind so far as we can see has yet to be reaped the saints in mrs mckenzie daniels novel are many but the sinners indeed are few there is not a good thoroughgoing scamp in the whole book and the little fairhaired clever german girl who does the flirting and is for her very pardonable love of admiration supposed to  reap the whirlwind is thrown among a set so intensely proper and milkandwaterish that we regard the poor thing as more sinned against than sinning mrs daniels books will always be welcome at the dorcas society and often read aloud no doubt to the members thereof much to their edification but if she wishes to address that wider audience which is called the public she must make her books more human and the first step in that direction would be to make her country rectors men as well as parsons here is an outline of the story mrs beamish is the widow of a country clergyman and not being left particularly well off she agrees that her two daughters gertrude and ethel having finished their education should open a boardingschool in the large house at lindenhurst which the generosity of a friend had enabled them to take with this end in view arrangements had been made with their german cousin meta kauffman for her coming over to england and joining them in the labours of the school the two sisters have not yet finished their own education when they receive a letter from their mother announcing the rather sudden arrival of this german cousin and soliciting the return of one or other of them immediately in order that the stranger in a strange land might not be without a companion this letter rather puzzles the sisters at first but the younger of the two who is the teller of the whole story guesses very properly to this effect  it is simply as it seems to me that meta kauffman has turned out to be a young lady of sufficient personal and mental attractions to make a dangerous 1eteatete companion day after day for our sensitive if not susceptible brother and mamma who is easily frightened catches hold of the first straws that she sees floating towards her in this dire extremity if aleta had only been content to remain in her happy fatherland a few weeks longer guy would have been safe at cambridge and you and i quite free to devote ourselves to the young persons entertainment by the time ethel arrives however the mischief is done and her impressionable brother guy is the adoring slave of the goldenhaired meta the cousin moreover never joins in the school but accepts a situation as governess in a neighbouring family to which she is recommended by mrs arnott a lively young widow whose acquaintance she has converted into a friendship the fascinating manners and wonderful singing of the new governess gain the good opinions of every one and it is even whispered that young edmund hallam heir to the earldom of clinton thinks more of her than he does of alicia clarkson the young lady to whom lhe is engaged in the meantime the two sisters open school with three or four pupils among whom is included little maggie the delicate child of the new rector his visits become frequent and result in his engagement to ethel he is a grave man of middle age superhumanly modest and saintlike in his piety ethels affection for hin is also of the supernal kind she does not so much love as worship him meta kauffmans engagement as governess at the vivians ends abruptly and she returns to the sisters in disgrace it is now that the rev harold wvyke sees her and looking at her for the first time and much to his astonishment he recognises in meta kauffman mrs alan beresford to whose dying husband at heidelberg he had administered the last sacrament some four years ago on discovering the frivolity of her nature he had very soon repented of his marriage and in order that lie might ultimately shake her off he had persuaded her that that marriage was an irregular one and their little boy illegitimate this he told the clergyman when dying and that that same little boy whom he had placed with maiden aunts of his in devonshire was the real heir to the earldom of clinton it was for seducing the affections of edmund hallam the supposed heir to the earldom that meta was disgraced and now that she discovered that she herself was the mother of the future earl she loses no time in writing to the man whom she had betrayed disclaiming all future connexion with him and starts at once for devonshire to recover her lost boy this journey into devonshire where we pur posely leave the reader and the discovering of alan earl of clinton is by far the most powerfully written part of the 1ook and perhaps the most touching thing mrs daniel has yet written the various scenes with maggie too are all genuine transcripts from nature so no doubt re the teaparties but the eternal twaddle of a v tage the gossip of the old maids and the visits u the parson are not exactly the things with which a threevolume novel with any pretensions in it ought to be filled reaping the whirlwind is an advance upon miriams sorrow which we reviewed some time ago but if mrs daniel means to become a real artist she must broaden her canvas and work for the world at

palace under its masters eye and especial protection to gether with the counts sons to this hem isabel with whom he had been familji from boyhood all in the usual way gives her affections instead of as in duty bound reserving them for the far less worthy lea handsome less clever sir gracien de foix the remaining damsel also jane de bou logne at a splendid tournament in honour of the assumption of

indignation of de foix at his intrusion but at janes intercession with the promise of never marrying him without the counts concurrence is allowed to go away too now many years previous to these events one arnaut de bearn was holding the fortress of lourdes for england this fortress wsw invaded by the duke of anjou de foix was afraid of the duke and wanted his friendship he therefore beguiled de bearn from his stronghold of lourdes to the castle of de foix and as soon as he had the person of de beam in his power made proposals for the surrender of lourdes to himself under flimsy pretences which could not cover his insidiou ess de beamn rejected his requisition nd de foix thereupon stabbed him to the heart john de bearnp brother of the murdered arnaut succeeded to his inheritance and together with le mengeant a freebooting chief ruled over the free bands of lourdes and its neighbourhood these chiefs employed themselves from that time in planning vengeance against de foix and in

eustace and the two wards the story is built eustace turns out to be the son of the murdered arnaut de bearn and by means of a secret understanding between his widowed mother and the late countes de

she may not marry montpensier because de foix once in a passion made an oath against it the duke de berry therefore father of montpensier with a loving eye to the lands demands her for himself and the wily de foix is well content to purchase such an alliance with the resignation of his sons claim to her the professed object of the novel is to give an account of the manners and customs o the fourteenth century and accordingly throughout the three volumes we are not allowed above one page of genuine story to two of tiresome entangled and foolish description of the exterior and interior of buildings with all their confused intricacies together with the paraphernalia of monkish devotion and chivalric rites surely there is a full abundance of conventional etiquettes of this present day to be gotten by heart without an additional load upon the memories of youth of a mass of exploded reremonial what importance the author attaches to these transient peculiarities of past times is sufficiently manifested by her weaving them into a story the main and declared object of which is an elucidation of them but although there can be no objection to an acquaintance with chivalrous and monkish usages or the cobwebbed corners and passages of abbeys or feudal castles and although one gifted pen has graven their details like spells about our hearts and memories yet we must deprecate the cold study of a thing so evanevcnt and so little applicable to our universal wants and interests for the supply of which universal and permanent truth alone can suffice we consider the able representation of human character under whatever conventionalt forms it may be moulded or in whatever garb arrayed as of the nature of univei truth but the present novel has no claim to ability upon such a score or indeed upon any grounds at all and our duty alone and the sweet consciousness of discharging that zaously and impartially has enabled us to wade through the book,folklore_contra

  literature the roots of the mountains by william morris reeves  turner although the characters in mr morriss new romance are set among very archaic surroundings they appear to be essentially of a mediaeval type the men of burgdale are a people of german blood though many of their customs appear to differ from those described in the germania inhabiting a town or thorp in a valley  amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams of a fair land situate apparently somewhere in the southern tyrol the village or little markettown was set in a fortified pass shut in by cliffs and protected by a wall and towers on a knoll near the brow of the cliff the men of old times had built a strong and great watchtower and therefrom the thorp had its name and the whole valley also and it was called burgstead in burgdale there was a space of about fifty acres betwixt the wall and the wandering stream  and therein we are told lay burgstead in a space of  the shape of a swordpummel the houses were all of stone  with much fair and curious carved work of knots and beasts and men round about the doors or whiles a wall of suchlike work all along the housefront the dalesmen were as expert at stonework as their upland neighbours the woodlanders were at carving runes and patterns on their oaken beams the shepherdfolk higher up on the downs lived a ruder life in scattered homesteads and were not very curious in their houses and halls the three folks were united in the bonds of kindred and friendship and formed in fact one rustic state governed by one alderman and meeting in the same folkmote the men of burgdale were great producers of corn and a good red wine which was bought by the foreign merchants they were very successful in goldwashing but the silvermines in the neighbourhoodin silverdale across the mountainshad been seized by a dusky tribe of mongol or hunnish affinities with whose defeat by the dalesmen and their allies the story is principally concerned the men of the dale also sold weapons of such fashions as were used in the westland  and golden cups and chains and fair rings set with mountainblue stones and copper bowls and vessels gilt and parcelgilt and mountainblue for staining the woodlanders brought down woodcarvings and peltries and the shepherds  such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer with the neighbours the marketplace was wherever anyone cared to pitch a booth but we are told that for the most part this was done in the wide street between the gate and the bridge the gradual growth of a commercial town from the trademeetings of countryfolk and foreign chapmen the  nundinae barbarorum of classical description is indicated with great force and precision there is a particularly interesting account of the visit of the men of shadowy yale a murky region into which the wolftribe had been driven by the hunnish savages to the great springmarket at burgstead  gay was the show for the booths were tilted over with painted cloths and the merchants themselves were clad in long gowns of fine cloth scarlet and blue and white and green and blaok with broidered welts of gold and silver and their knaves were gaily attired in short coats of diverse hues with silver rings about their arms and short swords girt to their sides people began to gather about these chapmen at once when they fell to opening their dales and their packs and unloading their wains there had they iron both in pigs and forged scrap and nails steel they had and silver both in ingots and vessel pearls from over sea cinnabar and other colours for staining suoh as were not in the mountains madder from the marshes and purple of the sea and scarlet grain from the holmoaks by its edge and woad from the deep clayey fields of the plain silken thread also from the outer ocean and rare webs of silk and jars of olive oil and fine pottery and scented woods and sugar of the cane the headman of the merchants brings news of a great invasion of dusky men who had overthrown the armies of the cities in the plain and how they had piled up skulls into great hills beside the city gates  and how because of the death and the rapine grass had grown in the kings chambers and the wolves had chased deer in the temples of the gods the prince of the tribe from the murky vale arrives in glorious array with his sister the sunbeam whose courtship by goldmane of burgdale otherwise called faceofgod gives a romantic colour to the story and relieves the readers mind from the gloom of the guerilla war and murders grim and great and the tumult of the long battle in which the felon tribes in rosedale meet their wellearned doom folkright the prince of the wolfrace is a kind of robin hood who only robs a skinflint or occasionally holds a merchant to ransom and it is to be observed that he pays for the purchase of a dagger and a  web of gold and silk as well as a fine for robbery set upon him in the folkmote with the treasure of silver rings wbich his soldiers had taken from their dusky enemies the character of the princess is finely drawn she seems likely at first to be the bringer of strife and misfortune like another helen on the peaceful children of the vale but the threatened evils are fortunately turned full upon the horde of invaders the valiant and beautiful bride who loses her  goldmaned  chieftain is consoled with a new love for folkright and a happy life in the purified halls of silverstead there are plenty of songs interspersed with the story and some of the best are sung by the bride others are sung by an amazonian  bowmay  to the music of woodwonts goodly fiddle and goldmane is called upon for the song of the ford telling how the warriors returned to their cloverfields and meads of mowing grass after a wild battle upon the hills  in haytide through the day newborn across the meads we come our hauberks brush the blossomed corn a furlong short of home another fine poem occurs in the description of a journey to the fotest for mickb that would quarter best for bowstaves the brethren of the house of the face go forth at the aldermans bidding and find the bride waiting for them we have only room for a portion of the description which is noticeable for its extreme simplicity and directness  so came they to the yewwood and the brethren fell to work and the bride with them for she was deft with the axe and strong withal but at midday they rested on the green slope without the yewwood and they ate bread and flesh and onions and apples and drank red wine of the dale and while they were resting the bride sang to them an ancient song of the coming of the murdercarles no man can tell how many they be and the voice of their host as the thunder rolls the men of a little peaceful settlement hear the true story of the coming danger but determine to defend their home against all the world  it was summertide and the month of hay and men and maids must fare afield but we saw the place where the bowstaves lay and the hall was hung with spear and shield  when the moon was high we drank in the hall and they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe and they said come back when the chestnuts fall and the winecarts wend across the hythe  come oft and oer again they said wander your ways but we abide for all the world in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  yea come in arms if ye will they said and despite your host shall we abide for life or death in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  so she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreading wide before her and a robin came nigh from outof a tbornbush and sung his song also the sweet herald of coming winter and the lapwings wheeled about black and white above the meadow by the river sending forth their wheedling pipe as they i hung above the soft turf there is no space to quote the account of the gathering of the host in burgdale the bowmens battle on the edge of silverdale and the onslaught of the men of the steer the bridge and the bull and all the other banners of the united kindreds the reader will find plenty of homeric fighting with the victory inclining always to the right side the felons are massacred and peace returns to the desolated valleys the kindreds became one folk  for better or worse in peace and in war in waning and waxing meeting together in shadowy vale as a holy place when converse and council were needed and so in the words with which the book concludes  no more as now telleth the tale of these kindreds and

jewels in brass by jittie horlick duckworth and co 6s miss jittie horlick has accomplished two things in which many more experienced novelists fail in  jewels in brass  there is an arresting beginning and a graceful close the mythical continent of atlantis forms the scene of the opening chapters two characters figure here which are afterwards reincarnated in ordinary modern forms they consist of a charming young woman and a gentleman with peculiar eyes destined in his previous state to meet and be attracted by this same young woman the scene of their first meeting and the barriers to their union must be left to the reader to discover throughout the story there are several flashes of very good insight into the workings of the womans mind although there cannot be said to be any considerable development of it after her first great step the book consists more of a series of incidents and ordinary happenings rather than any particular delineation of character the whole forms very agreeable reading however and those who pursue the story to its end can be promised an hour or twos keen enjoyment,folklore_contra
nine tales by hugh de selincourt nisbet 5s net mr de selincourts work is extremely difficult to characterise the charm of it is elusive and those who want an appreciative analysis must be referred to the sixpage introduction by mr harold child enough for the moment to recognise the fine individual quality of this writers mind as exhibited in his unhurrying undelaying prose the undertone is the thing it is a sort of  burhido a captaincy of ones soul clean and responsive to a tangled but tremendously significant universe naturally this aim does not make for conventional storytelling and mr de selincourts audience will be more significant by its qaulity than its numbers but the numbers will surely grow,folklore_contra
bobin gray by charles gibbon blackie and son wherever the english language is spoken the touchingly pathetic ballad of  old robin grey  is one of the most familiar of household songs and never was poetic popularity more richly deserved it is perhaps the most perfect of all ballads in respect to conception and design and the execution is fully commensurate with its other merits latterly it would seem that a revival of interest in the sad scottish story has taken place for it appeared in a dramatic form at one of our westend theatres a few weeks back and now it furnishes the groundwork of a threevolume novel by mr charles gibbon we do not know what motive mr gibbon had in selecting the simple theme of a wellknown ballad upon which to build a rather elaborate superstructure of romance as it appears to us that that portion of the story which deals with the wellknown incidents is the least interesting from the simple fact of their being so well known it is only in the first volume however that we have to do with the familiar episodes of the departure of jeamie to sea the courting of old robin grey and the wedding and the return of jeamie for the other two volumes are occupied with matter entirely of mr gibbons invention for example when the young sailor returns and finds his sweetheart married he runs in despair to a neighbours house and sits down confused and stunned unable to determine upon his movements for the future by the machinations of a certain mr nicol mcwhapple a mean scheming wretch who has wormed his way into the rather important position of laird of clashgirn by fraud and treachery jeanie is lured to this house for the supposed purpose of bringing succours to her husband who has been falsely represented to her to have met with an accident robin is afterwards brought to the same place where he discovers his wife and jeamie together and this combined with other circumstances artfully contrived by mcwhapple raises in robin such a furious passion of jealousy that he spurns his wife from him and rshes from the place the body of a man is found shortly afterwards in the vicinity of the house and is identified as that of jeamie whom robin is accused of having murdered his faithful wife jeanie refuses to believe that he is guilty of this terrible crime although the circumstaoes are very suspicious and i i she makes the most superhuman efforts to ablish i innocence notwithstanding the cruel and injurious terms that he had heaped upon her in his unreasoning jealousy she visits him in prison in order to hear the truth from his own lips i wasna expecting ye he answered in a low husky voice no with a tone of sad bitterness ye couldna think weel eneuch o me to fancy that i would care what came o ye ye thought that i would just leave ye to whatever might happen without trying to help ye maybe i should hae done that but i couldna i dinna care what ye may think o me but i couldna sit idle at hame and ken ye needed help without trying to gie it ye91 rm thankfu to ye i dinna seek your thanks i dinna need them wi heavens will i shall do what a wife should do for ye in your trouble but when thats by yell find that i can keep awa frae yeaye as dourly as ye would keep awa frae me he passed his hand absently over his brow and his lips trembled it was a wretched sight this strong man weak and helpless as a child  im thankfu to ye he said again feebly and at that all her bitterness vanished leaving only the fond sympathetic woman she advanced to him and laid her band on his arm he trembled at her touch but he made no effort to thrust her from him as she had half feared he would do i hae just ae question to speir she said softly  and after that ill no fash ye any mair wi my presence im listening did ye meet jeamie falcon after ye left me in askaig house  did ye see him again or hear him or come near him in any way she watched him with terrible eagerness as she pronounced the twords the question seemed to rouse him from his lethargy he rose to his height erect and firm as he had been before this calamity he shook her hand from his arm and his eyes flashed angrily e you too doubt me  he exclaimed hoarsely i but what else scould i expect you wha never cared for me and loved himrwhat could ye do but be the first to think me guilty   r oh man dinna speak thae cruel fause words to me the noo ibut answer meanswer me frae your heart truly as though ye ewas at the judgmentseat and gie me strength to save ye he regarded her fixedly for an instant and then answered with ra steady voice only avoiding falcons name i never saw him or heard him or came near him to my knowledge after i left him and you in askaig house  god be thankedo god be thanked for that she cried dropping on her knees with clasped hands upraised and tears of grateful joy streaming down her cheeks he turned his back upon her for he could not look upon that face so bright with faith in him without a sharp twinge of remore for all he had done to cloud it she whom he had so readily doubted whose truth he had so doggedly refused to credit she whom he had spurned from him accepted his single word against all the evidence in the world that was the sharpest sting of all to feel that she could trust him so much when he had shown so little trust in her it is not necessary to enter into all the complications of the plot which are arranged in a very masterly manner and carry the reader along in breathless interest indeed so thoroughly skilful is mr gibbon in handling his materials that we regret he did not invent the whole of his story instead of forming it upon the basis of a ballad for by so doing he has spoilt the charming simplicity of the song and by no means added to the attraction of the novel it will suffice to say that robin grey is proved guiltless of the crime with which he is charged and although jeanies sense of outraged womanly dignity induces her to hold aloof from her husband after she has completed her task of duty in refuting the false accusations against him yet she is at last reconciled to him upon the birth of a child at last he looked at the mother whose pale face was turned towards him jeanie he cried with the bsby singing a chorus will naething move ye to forgie me winna our bairn dot  and he held the child in his outstretched arms as if to let it plead for him she took the bairn to her breast hushing its cries and then she answered with a low tender voice i hae done that lang syne robin for i ken ye maun hae tholed mucklesorrow but  d inna say but he cried bending over her god kens what i hae tholed and god kens that it was because ye were sae dear to me that i was sae blind youre een are open noo  aye but what guid is that to me if they are only open to let me see what i hae lost to let me see that there is nae hope for me o winning it back in this world dinna send me awa jeanie for the bairns sake dinna send me awa she looked straight in his eyes ye hae nae doubt left in your heart that i hae told you the truth   ye mind me o my ain shameye mind me that i wish the tongue bad been cut frae my mouth afore it had spoken the words it did ye mind me o my ain misery when ye speir that  but it might rise atween us again and that is what gard me think it would be better for us no to be thegither any mair 1 ye winna trust me bitterly 0 woman if there could be onything come atween you and me again the mindin o that night at askaig would make me crush it aneath my foot like the pooshen head o a serpent a pause she gazing earnestly in his face then satisfied i believe ye robin and yell come hame  another pause then very softly  for the bairns sake and yours as weelyes god be thanked he stooped down and kissed her and so the bairn came as the fable has it with an angel message and this particular message was one of grace to robin gray the work abounds in tender touches of nature and sweet appeals to the affections and there are also many truthful sketches of rustic life and manners the finest and most elaborate painting of individual character in the book is undoubtedly that of nicol mwhapple a creation that will not suffer by comparison with any of the famous portraits of scott this character alone places  robin gray decidedly above the ordinary run of novels but there are other excellences that stamp it as a work of peculiar merit i  v fe ti coidt of g itoddapo the diso f ihe guilt of thx laid of lhwgn and the long uslfunaakhg of the latter to jeage naoon are mniaet cnceived with remarkable imagative power and wrought out with true dramatic force in an age when wellwritten novels are as oommon as tthe blades of grw upon a lawn it is something to produce a work adistinotive a fiower and this mr gibbon has accomplished  robin gray by w gibbon london h s king and co to see the story of  old robin grey  in the form of a novel or indeed in any shape other than the words of the delightful old ballad itself is we must confess a matter of regret to us as however nothing seems too sacred to a novelist or a playwriter we must put aside our own senti ments and consider only how in our opinion a novel is written in the instance of the cheap reprint under notice we are glad to be able to endorse much of the praise that greeted mr gibbons work on its first appearance the writei has kept as much as possible to the letter of the story and has shown himself able to give a picture of scottish life with singular fidelity of detail nor is he wanting in keen insight into character in pathos or in descriptive power it seems to us a mistake to marry robin at the end of the book but with this exception we must congratulate mr gibbon on having accomplished very happily an exceedingly difficult task  robin gray it is just possible that the special merit of this simple and touching storyits subdued and truthful sketches of types of scotch charactermay be missed by the english reader for mr gibbon not only draws his lairds farmers fishermen and country lasses exactly as they are but he copies with an unusual minuteness the peculiarities of their speech and pronunciation burns and sir walter scott have sown a good many scotch words among us and many of these have been incorporated into our own tongue while in later days george macdonald has given us tolerably strong doses of that pronunciation which obtains north of the tweed most educated men have at least a literary knowledge of scotchthat is to say they know enough of it to understand burns as they know enough of old english to understand thomas sackville but in either case some effort is required and a novel should not present any feature demanding particular effort on the part of the reader mr gibbons reply is of course obvious he is describing certain types of people who speak in a certain way if he describes as faithfully as he can their appearance dress disposition and manners why not also their speech the argument is irrefutable but we beg mr gibbon to be a little more merciful to us in future works and to give us a somewhat larger leaven of english while on the topic of language we must add a word about the speech used by mr gibbons highlandmen and highlandwomen we know of no other book in which even a fair approximation is made to that extraordinary form of english which the highlanders have invented sir walter scott simply burlesqued this wonderful effort in language and most other writers who have written about the highlands have made the mistake of causing their highland characters to talk scotch some of mr gibbons examples we shall quote byandby the first volume of the present novel follows pretty closely the old and pathetic ballad which gives the story its name  old rob i grey  turns up as a scotch farmer  young jamie  is james falcon an orphan who has been brought up by the laird nicol mwhapple and the heroine is jeanie lindsay a fishermans daughter to make the crown a pound young jamie gaed to sea and old robin grey came acourting me says jeanie in the song and so it happens in the story but in the meanwhile tidings have come that jamie is drowned at sea for some cause or other nicol mwhapple the laird seems anxious to dispense with jamies presence on earth and as snbsequently appears enters into league with the skipper of the brig in which jamie sails to have the vessel set on fire when the planned catastrophe does occur all hands except the hero are saved in one of the boats and return to land with the story of his death misfortunes fall upon the lindsays and robin gray the welltodo farmer presses his suit with jeanie 1er father breaks his arm their cow is stolen and robin gray a very worthy and affectionate man assists them in an unobtrusive way then jeanie is persuaded by her parents to give her consent and robin is beside himself with joy there is a touch of genuine pathos in jeanies demeanour during this interview but i was gaun to say that im no my lane and for the sake o them that need my help for the sake o a that we are awing yew gin ye can take me understanin a that im ready to be your wife robin gray and ill try to be a hithfu ane ilits  bargain he cried lod wfith joy and catching her in his arms in spite of the plate which was smashed on the floor he kinsd her with a smack which certainly sounded of delight os a bargain and thats the erls he added  there never was lover so enthusiastic and there never was lady so cold she seemed to become aware that she was playing an ungracious part for she tried to smile and said softly robin gray a novel iy charles gibon author of dangerous connections three vol london blackie a son  ye winna heed me being a wee thixg quiet fur its ma i my heart to greet nor to laugh jamie returns to find his sweetheart married from this point the story is mr gibbons owvn and we cannot escape the conviction that he works better outside the trammels of the old ballad rthe extreme simplicity and tenderness of the song seem to have unwittingly compelled him to write this version of it in a subdued and minor key in the second and third volumes we find the same accuracy of portraiture as in the first but we find also an additional vigour and freedom which deal boldly with incident and detail and awaken a powerful interest the story after jamies return shows the simple materials of the ballad shaken into new combinations jamie sees his married sweetheart and has a brief and pathetic interview with her imprudently she conceals the fact of her having seen him from her husband who hears of jamies visit nevertheless it is the laird mwhapple who is trying to rouse the old farmer into jealousy and he effectually does so for he forges a letter which causes jeanie alone to set out and travel to a house in which james falcon is now living and then he tells robin grey that jeanie has gone off to meet her old lover robin follows her the night is frightfully stormy and he has to cross a swollen torrent in which his horse is lost he reaches the house finds his wife cruelly upbraids her and will not listen to her explanations finally he rushes out into the fierce night again jeanie rushing after him hears a loud scream and catches sight of her husband hurrying through the dark next day a dead body terribly mutilated is found among the rocks in the river when the spate has subsided the body is dressed in the clothes of james falcon for whose murder robin grey is now apprehended however james falcon again turns up explaining that he had lent some clothes on that night to a poor idiot lad who must have been mistaken for him and murdered robin grey is not the less in danger as the presumption is that lhe had thrown the lad over the cliff believing him to be james falcon jeanie comes to falcon and beseeches him to aid her in getting her husband out of danger this they do between them for it transpires that the real murderer of the lad was a certain ivan carragh the tool of mwhapple mwhapple is in the possession of property which ought to belong to falcon and fearing that jamie may discover the means by which he has been robbed of his birthright the laird resolves upon his destruction that the crime is brought home to him in the endthat he dies in prisonand that ivan carragh comes to the gallowsare details necessarily demanded by poetical justice but for the close of the storybeautiful and appropriate as it iswe are entirely indebted to mr gibbon we confess to have had a fear that robin grey was about to perish in some sudden and opportune manner to allow jamie to marry his old love but nothing of the kind occurs robin grays extreme affection for his wife is repaid by a loyal trust and love which are but the natural expressions of jeanies character and falcon having got the lairds property goes again to sea comes back a captain marries and is henceforward the fast friend of jeanie and her guidman how mr gibbon brings us to see that this end of the story is the proper oneindeed the only one which could possibly satisfy the readerwe cannot exhibit here in theso meagre outlines of the tale ivan carragh is a capital character indeed he is about as satisfactory a villain as we have ever met with in a book his sublime unconsciousness his coolness his splendid capacity for whisky and his excellent gaelic make him quite a treasure after he has gagged jeanie and carried her on board the brig he quietly remarks  youll no care to jump into the water and if youll doill no care then he asks her goodnaturedly if  shell hae a dram there is a fine touch of humour here which many readers might not perceive among the lower classes in scotland the general form of salutation addressed to any one entering a house is will ye tak a dramp accordingly mr gibbons characters whether bent on murderous or felonious intent invariably ask each other to  hae a dram there is something peculiarly odd in the notion of a mans being confronted by his bitterest enemy and yet out of custom asking him to drink whisky when carragh is drawn into conversation about the man whom he fancied he had murdered the old habit is so strong upon him that he drinks h good health here is a conversation between jeanie and ivan when the latter has carried her on board the brig  ie suddenly dropped his fat dirty hand on

probably no ballad has ever attained so great and lasting a popularity as that of old robin gray written almost exactly one hundred years ago by lady anne barnard daughter of one of the earls of balcarres it almost instantly upon publication excited an extraordinary degree of admiration which has scarcely diminished with the lapse of time the tender truthful and affecting picture of high principle in humble life which forms its subjectmatter and the simplicity of diction which marks its composition have from the first recommended it to all readers of pure and refined taste at the same time the evidences of real power which it unquestionably possesses the truly tragic depths of feeling which it lays bare and the dramatic ability strongly evidenced in the narration of the story entitle it to a high literary position as a work of art it has taken its place among those few compositions of any age which are the common property of allof the unlearned as well as of the learned in the novel form it would certainly be impossible to say that it has not suffered but it is no mean praise to say that it has not suffered very greatly mr gibbon is to be congratulated upon having performed a very difficult task better than was to be anticipated from the difficulties which necessarily stood in his way he has n only reproduced in prose the original story with remarkable fidelity but he hs provided a very reasonable and spirited continuation of it and has brought about his catastrophe withousviolating in any marked degree either the cd sistency of the characters or thc probabilities of the situation as pictured in thc poem it is true the dialogue is written in a somewhat unmanageable scotch dialect and this may be a difficulty with southern readers but north of the tweed it is doubtless an extra charm and besides being a perfectly justifiable artifice it has the strong precedent of the original to favour it altogether we are persuaded from our own experience that this difficulty once surmounted a perusal of the book will repay those readers who care for a pretty tale prettily told with not too much horror or sensation in it and some really fine touches of nature interspersed here and there the ballad closes with the dismissal of the returned former lover and the resolution of old robin grays wife to be true to him even in thought under all and any circumstances this period is in the novel the commencement of the catastrophe james falcon the first lover has returned and is known to be in the neighbourhood by an artfullycontrived scheme robin grey is rendered jealous of him and soon after what is supposed to be his body is found under circumstances which lead strongly to the inference that foul play has been resorted to robin grey is arrested and thrown into prison and jeanie his wife rendered desperate not so much by this circumstance as by the fact of his believing her guilty resolves to penetrate the mystery at all nazards in order to accomplish this she is made to embark in a series of adventures the recital of which is perhaps the weakest part of the book resulting of course in the triumphant vindication of her husbands innocence robin grey is released and restored to the arms of his affectionate wife the real murderer turns up in the person of ivan carrach a halfdrunken shipscaptain and falcon supposed to be dead explains how upon the night of the murder he changed clothes with an idiot boy who thus suffered in his stead all are thus made comparatively happy though we fancy it would have savoured more of true poetic justice were falcon to have been got rid of finally in some honourable manner and not to have turned up again married and thus untrue to his first romantic passion,folklore_contra
inina bc ka fie story of a maiden of ra in two volumes originally published in  blackwoods magazine blackwood nina balatkaa was a maiden of prague born of christian parents and herself a christian but she loved a jew that is the first sentence of this novel and the whole novel is a very simple and very chaming history of the maidens love and the troubles into which it brought her and through which it bore her it is a lovestory and nothing more but if we are tired of lovestorie we shall find the book delightful reading by reason of its lively pourtrayal of the ways of life half mediaval and half oriental in the quaint old capital of bohemia and if we want a novel with a purpose we shall find in it a very trenchant argument against the hundredheaded i prejudice which would raise up barriers between the membm of diferet religions or different uatioalitis or dissert iocaul anel instead of aseing bonds of univm  sympathyand kindliness in the goam on virtues gua muon nature nina father joseph balatha is a brokendwu mercat of prague mined it is supposed through the dishoest practises of his brotherinlaw and former parut and the father and daughter at the time of the sto ar living or

bad fallen into the hands of balatas brotherinlaw wbo like many other christians thinks it is no sin to rob a jew the jew is too generous towards his old friend to car about prng him for the deeds but he is anxious to obwn what is his by right and his son anton trendellsohn who now chiefly camres on the business of the house is yet more anxious on the subject he it is whom nina loves and her love makes her also anxious that the deeds should be restored to their owner therefore when she horrifies her rich kinsfolk by telling them of her betrothal to the jew she further enrages them by demanding the production of the mising documents they on the other hand find a new value in their possession as there is a chance of their being useful in breaking off the match therefrom grow nina balatkas chief troubles anton trendellsohn scornfully refuses to be bribed by the restitution of his own property into the relinquishment of a project from which his fathers threat of disinheritance does not for a moment deter him but when he is solemnly assured by christian after christian that the paper is in ninas own possession and is withheld by her for treacherous purposes of her own his suspicions are aroused thence comes much unhappiness to her to which is added the lesser troubletrue lover that she isthat her father is slowly dying nor are these all she knows that many years before her first meeting with anton it had been arranged especially by the elder trendellsohn that he should take to wife a beautiful rebecca loth and though she is assured that anton never loved rebecca she knows that his reversal of this plan and his marriage instead to a hated christian will bring upon him many difficulties she knew it before but she sees it more plainly after the visit which her rival pays to her nina rose from her chair directly she saw her visitor and came forward to meet her i suppose you hardly know who i am fraulein   said rebecca robe yer said nina with her pleasantest smile you are rebeccalt  yea i am rebecca loth the jewess  i like the jews said nina rebecca was not dressed now as she had been dressed on that gala occasion when we saw her in the jews quarter then she had been as smart as white muslin and bright ribbons and velvet could make her now she was olad almost entirely in black and over her shoulders she wore a dark shawl drawn closely round her neck but she bad on her bead now as then that peculiar hungarian hat which looks almost like a coronet in front and gives an spect to the girl who wear it half defiant and half attractive and there were there of course the long glossy black ourls and the darkblue eyes and the turn of the face wbich wa o completely jewbish in its bard bold almost repellant beauty nina had id that e liked the jews but when the words were spoken she remembered that they might be open to misconstruction and she blushed the same idea occurred to rebecca but she scorned to take advantage of even a successful rival on such a point as that she would not twit nina by any hint that this assumed liking for thu jews was simply a special predilection for one jew in particular  we are not ungrateful to you for coming among us and knowing us said rebecas then there was a slight pause for nina hardly know what to sy to her visitor but rebecca continued to speak we bear that in other countries the prejudice against us is dying away and that christi sty with jews in their houses and jews with christians eating with them and drinking with them i fear it will never be so in prague  and why not in prague i hope it may why should we not do in prague a they do elsewhere   ab the feeling is too firmly settled here we have our own quarter and live altogether spot a christian here will hardly walk with a jew unless it be from counter to counter or from bank to bank as for their livivg togeherr even eating in the s roomdo you ever see it  nina of course understood the meaning of this that which the girl said to her wa intended to prove to her how impossible it was that she should marry a jow and live in prague with a jew  ahi wife but she who bad stood her ground before aunt sophie who had never flinched for a

made by the hebrew in the gallery of fiction as a stronglymarked individual he has at one time or other tempted almost every fertile novelist who has dealt with serious passions and incidents it is noticeable however that he has principally figured in one of two types and those of the widest contrasteither as a cunning and vengeful fiend or as an oppressed sage and benefactor his diabolical or celestial qualities alike taking form and colour from what may be called the fatalities of his race it is further to be observed that the rehabilitations so to say with which the hebrew has been justly credited in fiction have frequently been consequent on representations made by his people as to the injustice of such wholesale blackening of their faces miss edgeworth owns herself to have

israelite and so passionately that no prohibition nor contempt could shake her heart loose from its moorings anton trendellsohn her lover was as devoted as herself but not without his share of trials on the part of his family and friends who could ill bear the thoughts of his separating himself from them to waste love on a christian girl the conflict of these sympathies and antipathies involving little or no episode and few subordinate characters make up the story which is told so clearly and tersely and with so much real feeling as to retain the reader to the last of course the marriage could not be allowed to take place without an all but fatal misunderstanding having been brewed by those whose interest it was to separate the lovers and in the agony of her heart nina was driven into the intention of committing suicide the night scene on the moldau bridge where she nearly effected her fearful purpose is well described and not too longdrawnout a picture more desolate more bitter in the despair it conveys cannot be conceived how nina was saved and by her rival rebecca lotha beautiful jewess in her own sphere as highminded and noble as rebecca in  ivanhoeis charmingly and naturally told the longdrawn sadness of the tale is in some measure redeemed by its close and we breathe freely when we know that anton and his christian bride went forth from amid though oppressions and family prejudices of prague to work out their lives under the conditions of a more liberal dispensation elsewhere to every thoughtful not vacant reader of novelsto those especially to whom the

warp and woof or the reminiscences of doris tlttcher by holme lee 3 vols  smith elder  co from the pen of holme lee this book is a disappointment the warp and woof are woven into a web sad in colour and of a minute and monotonous pattern doris fletcher relates a series of misfortunes very erettily no doubt and intersperses her own istory with very just and true remarks on life in general and the relative positions of men and women iu particular but we do not want to iv ad for our amusement and relaxation a catalogue of calamities which happen to people every day and may happen to ourselves before we die for aught we know there is no use in studying the subject of ruined fortunes broken hearts crippled limbs povertyscandal illnature from those of our own household and resentment and faithlessness in those we love and trust the most it is all true enough that thee tilings do constantly happen in the world and will continue to happen as long as the world lasts but let us bide our time it will not make our own miseries less bitter to know that it is only the common lot of man and that after all other people have been quite as unfortunate as ourselves or that a fabulous doris fletcher has been through more than wo have and yet born it very patiently in taking up a novel we hope to forget our little personal griefs and wrongs for a time at least we wish to be taken out of ourselves and amused and cheered and not to have the melancholy fact thrust back upon us that no one is to be trusted that women are persecuted injured beings who are not allowed to earn even an honest livelihood that our purest motives and our most innocent actions are sure to be misinterpreted and misrepresented  and that in short we have only to do our best and prepare for the worst it may be all very true but it is dishearteniug doctrine to preach and more likely to enervate and enfeeble than to strengthen and encourage the youthful novelreader and elderly people do not require warning and as a rule never read melancholy books  they have had too many troubles of their own to take much interest in  doris fletcher or any other heroine of romance  but a good joke or a cheerftd anecdote would b  pleasant to them we begin the story ofthe fletchers by finding them bankrupt and ruined the father irritable and querulous the sons emigrating the mother heartbroken doris the daughter by the first wife mourning her lover who though true to her died just as he ought to have married her and made her happy ursula the eldest daughter of the present mrs fletcher is odious and unnatural and connie is rather a silly little beauty who is petted by every one except ursula and perfectly worshipped by her halfsister doris who only wishes to be to her  as a special providence that she may guard her from all the evils and temptations of this wicked world on finding themselves ruined the fletcher family retire to a small village on the seacoast called redcross where they fall in with the usual amount of elderly young ladies and widows and doctors and clergymens families and go to tiresome little teaparties and dorcas meetings and picnics c just as people always do in country villages doris is quiet and demure and takes pleasure in seeing connie happy but ursula is fine about it and is bored to death and gives herself airs and grows jealous of connie ursulas character is overdrawn and as must sometimes happen in autobiographies the narrator is very onesided in her views thus doris gives us to understand that ursula had not one good or pleasing quality in her she cannot move look or speak without being guilty of some mean or spiteful action whereas connie is just as incapable of having a fault or a failing in the eyes of doris at least it is another version of cinderella and the cruel sisters but it is not true to nature they are both commonplace women to be met with every day the one sweetened by beauty and affection the other soured by adversity and thc consciousness that she is not appreciated at home in spite of herself doris gives ursula some fine traits and it is a decided mistake to make her refuse a good offer of marriage for herself and yet pursue constance with such vindictive and relentless spite because she also has a lover very poor and very disagreeable whom she does wish to marry and whom we are distinctly told ursula certainly did not love herself yet no other reason would account for her dislike to her young sister or for the very strong measures she took to sever her from dr julius eden who was but a harsh suspicious man after all and not worthy of all the wretchedness and illhealth the little one bestowed upon his shortcomings as for doris she hates ursula fully as much as ursula hates connie and judges her quite as hardly and a more uncomfortable family party can scarcely be imagined and yet one sees how it might be true if it were not so exaggerated and so partially delineated ursula is at last determined to stand it no longer and takes a situation in a noblemans family in the neighbourhood where we are led  to suppose she has every discomfort under though sun only she is too proud to own the fact and chooses out of spite to say she is very happy as indeed she probably might have been if doris could have believed it possible being out herself ursula cannot rest till she hunts o  connie out as well and she accordingly finds a mrs tom claridge a forsaken wife who wishes for a nursery governess dr julius is furious because old mr fletcher will not consent to his marrying connie till he has enough to live upon and still more irate at ins future wife  being a governess and finally when connie hastily comes home having been insulted by mr tom claridge and gone through a scene with his jealous wifejust at the very moment when her fiance should have stepped forward and guarded her from all evil reports and unpleasant stories dr julius cuts her dead sends back her letters without a word and breaks off all communication with her family and only because she did not in a letter tell him the whole particulars of her leaving the claridge family so naturally enough redcross and ursula begin to  talk  and to suspect connie must be to blame connies illness and nervousness and despair and ursulas cruelty are all related at great length and with painful minuteness and though the quarrel is duly made up at the end of the book and ursula is forbidden the house of her brotherinlaw we cannot help thinking connie must have had rather a trying time of it with her hard uncompromising doctor then there is another mistakedoriss heart being supposed to be buried in the grave of her true lover she thinks she is justified in setting up a iifrimdna dangerous amusement  but we have some pages of reasoning upon the injustice of the world in not allowing men and women to be friends without being  talked about doris is very devoted to her friend an eccentric and maundering kind of man and she goes to see him and his old mother and he comes to see her and they tell each other everything till at last one day doris sees him walking with another elderly young lady a mutual friend to whom it seems he was once engaged many years before doris declares and protests she was not the least  in love with mr westmore and we suppose we are in duty bound to believe her yet why if he were a mere friend need she turn so faint and blind and dizzy that she stumbles over a precipice in going home and so becomes a cripple for life i never loved mr westmore she says as my friend i prized himand as my friend only the sting of it was that he would want me no longer since he had found his earliest and best sympathiser in the woman he had been attached to formerly some persons seem to think thero is no jealousy except in the passion of love but friends can be very resentful of an intruder between them it would be rather inconvenient however miss doris if all women were to take the marriages of their  friends and their friends onlyso very much to heart as not to be able to walk straight or to see their way home after hearing of them what are they to do when they are in love if this is a specimen of pure friendship  if though friend had been a miss westmore would doris have cared either doris is not true to herself or the story is grievously  out of drawing,folklore_contra

the adventures of harry richmond the adventures of harry richmond by george meredith in three volumes smith elder and co mr meredith writes cleverly but his cleverness has been turned to very bad account in this latest and apparently most ambitious of his novels it is in the form of an autobiography tracing the history of the hero from his birth till he is about thirty years old and it is doubtless intended to teach us many grand lessons about hereditary weaknesses in particular and all sorts of political and social matters in general towards this end mr meredith sets at defiance all ordinary rules of composition and indulges in the wildest vagaries of plotmaking  but the net result of his efforts is a work so enigmatical and with such constant affectation of wit that it is very irksome reading and so disappointing in the end that the reader who has plodded through the three volumes is likely to vow that he will never take up another of mr merediths novels in saying this we believe we are speaking heresy mr meredith is a prophet to a few and his habit of jerking out commonplaces as if they were wisdom is likely to be fascinating to some young ladies it is a poor habit however and it seems to have worn itself nearly threadbare in  the adventures of harry richmond  is it any waste of time to write of love   says harry richmond  the trials of life are in it but in a narrower ring and a fierier you may learn to know yourself through love as you do after years of life whether you are fit to lift them that are about you or whether you are but a cheat and a load upon the backs of your fellows the impure perishes the inefficient languishes the moderate comes to its autumn of decaythese are of the kinds which aim at satisfaction to die of it soon or late the love that survives has strangled craving it lives because it lives to nourish and succour like the heavens but to strangle craving is indeed to go through a death before you reach your immortality those sentences are a fair sample of the meaningless sententiousness with which mr meredith writes and they are put into the mouth of an utterly selfish man who after keeping at arms length during many years a young lady whom he is only disposed to marry in case another love affair in which he is engaged should prove hopeless at last comes back to her with a lying assurance that he has loved her all along and attempts to induce her then to take him instead of another man to whom after waiting many years for the other she has betrothed herself it may be a good thing to write down the sentimentalism that abounds in novels but it is certainly a bad thing to encourage the view in favour with many fashionable gentlemen that lovemaking is a lordly pastime for the superior sex only culpable when it leads to actual seduction or adultery and that womens hearts are only toys to play with or coin to profit by  and this is the gospel that mr meredith preaches harry richmonds history would have made the thread of a good novel had it been told simply and without praise he is the son of an unprincipled adventurer who is  the son of an actress and somebody and who accordingly spends everybodys money that he can get hold of in carrying on a lawsuit for recognition of his claims upon royalty and is meanwhile living as much like a prince as he can when he is not in a debtors prison harry richmond has in squire beltham a rich grandfather by his mothers side and the blunt honest squires character is not ill drawn though the drawing is a rough and exaggerated sketch not a finished portrait the squire wishes to make him his heir on condition of his renouncing his father and in the hope though this is wit an absolute condition that he will marry his cousin janet harrys father plays at higher game he maintains tn underhand connexion with his son squanders his monmr and schemes for his marriage with a german prhuazl thus after an account of harrys childish and schoolboy life which is perhaps the best portion of the book t2a complications of the story are brought about mr men dith has some power in constructing his puppets au the leading figures in the novel are sharply cut and many of the minor characters are fairly elaborated and individual ised  but they are only puppets they speak and act un naturally and if taken one by one some of them are tolerable their combined action is as preposterous as that of the puppets in a punchandjudy show mr meredith describes english life not as it is but as it pleases him to represent it and his description is alike unpleasant and unprofitable this is the more to be regretted because he throws out hints and collects rough material enough to stock two or three good novels with proper handling,folklore_contra

literature more leaves from the journal of a life in the highlands from 1862 to 1882 smith elder  co it is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be the twenty years with which the journal has to do was indeed an eventful period it was marked by such important incidents as thc francogerman and russoturkish wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves but with these matters the journal is altogether unconcerned it deals solely with the queens life in the highlands and though it is quite natural that her majestys subjects should wish to know what were the queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it it records no thrilling adventures a carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the journal offers to its readers the interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective we look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her as a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray though selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect an art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic and the special value of the queens journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour in these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects it is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the queen is so fond of scotland this book answers the question it is because there and especially in the highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity the queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of though house of stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors heredity asserts itself mr galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone for we arc insensibly reminded of king george iii farmer george when wo read the queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping but although the journal recounts the queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied but we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern the book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author charles j robinson  more leaves from the journal of a life in  0f the highlands from 1862 to 1882 btf literature  tn smith i crq elder  co   j th from a purely literary point of view there  he is not a great deal to say of the queens new j th hook its style is of the simplest and it al has the charm of naturalness which belongs  al to simplicity the story is told without effort  w or affectation of any kind and produces its j tc effect entirely by though force of sincerity her  q majesty is probably a sympathetic rather  s than an acute and dispassionate observer  a1 and everything that she sees is seen through  o sentiment that the sentiment itself is tl always pure and often elevated is a reason i why these records of home life in the royal c circle will find a responsive echo otherwise o the experiences recorded are not altogether 1 such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character t the book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen it affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare but it is e its simple human interest that gives the  hook its strongest appeal the reader rises  from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learned something more of the good  i woman by whom it was writtenthat above all else he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be born by all to whom it comes how will the queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of st pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the queens consort had died at windsor this book contains the answer to that question its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope of the queens personal character the volume contains naturally enough many indications that character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will it was so in those early days of her sovereignty when lord melbourne told the queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could eve happily i for long without a mans arintb rest on and when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero this womanly trait is obviously a key to the queens intimacy with dr norman macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered though tribute of an i abundant gratitude a keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that principal campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of though statue of the prince consort at aberdeen when it rained in torrents in other places the manifest sincerity saves everything the book contains some few indications of the queens taste in literature we gather that she is a warm lover of scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the duchess of saxecoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell scotts stories  to prince albert and his brother the  queen herself appears to be familiar with scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j we are told that brown gave her a copy of the poems of the ettrick shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things it is said in various places that lady churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books this is to be regretted though anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure a similar silence is observed with respect to the queens tastes in the arts wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte that her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence it is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is though sole business of the book to present but while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the queen must have thought and written frequently the following passage on a visit to abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to abbotsford the wellknown residence of sir walter scott it lies low and looks rather gloomy mr hope scott and lady victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present duke of norfolk with their children the young duke of norfolk and some other relations received us mr hope scott married first miss lockhart the last surviving grandchild of sir walter scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of sir walter they showed us the part of the house in which sir walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his ms of ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx sir walter had himself collected then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of sir walter in the study we saw his journal in which mr hope scott asked me to write my name which i felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others we went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are sir walters last clothes we ended by going into the diningrcom in which sir walter scott died where we took tea in this connexion it may be mentioned that when the queens uncle and early guardian leopold king of the belgians travelled in scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the princess charlotte he was for a few days the guest of sir walter scott at abbotsford while there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way an aged scotch divine alluded to the fact that though king was descended from frederick the wise elector of saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the reformation and to become a protector of martin luther thereupon leopold said that he felt more honoured by though mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay the relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the queen herself says in these  leaves of the strong protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of scotland her majesty s love of the highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment that she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough above all things the queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to carlyle goethe was the first to say  come let us make a description it will be remembered that the passages of the queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her majestys visits to poor highland women there was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to though queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman the present volume contains two such peep into highland life and the one we quote fresents us with though last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow grant on sunday august 22 1869 i went to see old mn grant whom i was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and i fear dying of dropsy on august 20 i again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way i took her hand and held it on the 27th she died on the 28th i stopped at her cottage and went in with louise and leopold we found all so clean and tidy but all so silent mrs gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death she had on the socks i gave her the day before yesterday she was in her eightyninth year probably the most enjoyable of these  leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the highlands here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep at a quarter to twelve i drove off with louise and leopold in the waggonette up to near the  bush the residence of william brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep this is a practice pursued all over the highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man james brown my shepherd though elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then william and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry to the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tyre and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough a very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping it was a very curious and picturesque sight more pathetic is the following  tuesday june ll 1872  brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time i was dreadfully shocked it was the child of a man named rattray who lives at cairnnacraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper abercrombies house not far from monaltrie farmhouse in the street at a little before five set off in the waggonette with beatrice and janie ely and drove along the north side of the river we stopped a little way beyond tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest they were searching everywhere while we were there the ol grandmother catenach by name who lives at souttar hole came running along in a great state of distress she is rattrays mother we drove on a little way and then turned round we heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at monaltrie burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below mrs pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the dee this burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen the little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the dee and carried along too dreadful  it seems from what i heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one we drove back and up to mrs grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  wednesday june 12  drove up to the bush to warn mrs william brown never to let dear little albert run about alone or near to the burn of though danger of which she was quite aware she said her husband william had started off early at three this morning some people went down to abergeldie and as far as the girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle no word of the poor child being found all were to start early to search that the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the queens domestic life in truth her majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment so long ago as the year of the queens accession the marquis of londonderry writing to the duke of buckingham said i hear melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection thia fact her premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience that these  leaves contain much moro about mr john brown than about lord beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise the book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers naturally enough brown became essential to the queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy it is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of browns robust independence and simple usefulness we do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness

strange true stones of zoiiaia by george w cve kegan tiltia co all men except a few belated partisans of slavery will be sure to welcome this charming biok from the chronicler of old creole days the

even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed romance have been faithfully translated or preserved whore this firsthand eviience is unattainable the romancer in deposing the editor has nevertheless chosen some true tradition for the groundwork of his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie brouillard the last is the best and the first as decidedly the weakest  salome muller  is loosely and lengthily spun ou end is hardly worthy of so skilled a practitioner as mr cable it also makes too heavy a call upon our interest in the extinct legal luminaries of new orleans fifty years ago too much is said about these phantoms and they are no convincingly reanimated  though the advocate christian roselius deserves his niche for his long duel in behalf of a most injured woman frankly what attracts us most in this and the succeeding stories is less the story itself than mr cables own combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables pencil at its best it must suffice to extract from attalie brouillard a description of the rascal quadroon camille dur our  fancy a small figure thin let us say narrowchested roundshouldered his complexion a dull clay colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own and his linen last weeks it doss not appear whether mr cable has any authority for these traits  but somebody mut surely have sat for such a portrait which we treasure as a bright scrap of reality a living face though it be but a sorry scoundrels saved from oblivion how great i the contrast between this trained portraiture of nature and the remaining four papers where nature herself meets us in all her leisurely process her repetitions her thrilling surprises produced by simple expedients these papers ere all written by women they are translated in three case and abridged in one but otherwise are published

only a pity that sa little could be printed of the french originals for the sake of their illspelt cager utterance the translations in most cases read well save that mr cable either in order to

incidentally how all through the dangerous journey and the siege this brave woman had been nearing her confinement and that the child as might be expected died when it came a reading of this journal might be recommended to those who aro for ever preaching the ennobling and awakening effects of war such may be the effect upon the side that is in the right but how of the wrng side is that ennobled the truth appears to be that people who in private life are just and humane often simply have the sleeping brute and maniac in their composition awakened at the sound of cannon all the more deserving

amongst the aristocracy of the ghetto by adolphus raymond ani anna buxni 8s 6d stanley paul the reader who arrives successfully at the finish of this uncommon book will certainly deserve credit for plenty of perseverance if he has done so without several interludes for steady perusal provokes a sense of monotony practically the whole of it is in the form of conversation and the best method of dealing with it is to pick it up at odd times for a leisure quarter of an hour so read it will not lack entertainment  sketches drawn from life of the newrich  is the subtitle and we must assume that the authors know intimately the types of which they write but truth to tell they are a class of people with which the average reader will have little acquaintance that is all to the good perhaps even though as a group they are not prepossessing some of the names detract from reality such as  mrs showoffski  and  miss bragger but the intimate revelation and discussion of jewish customs and beliefs compensates for this it is a peculiar book neither novel nor story and if the authors could have condensed their material the effect would have been improved the final chapter depicts a general squabble between the unwearving conversationalists the result of which we gather will be commemorated in another book if the authors will accept a friendly hint this second set of records should be pulled together and more strongly knit to give a more satisfying impression from the mistress of purity gap casselli i datk swu tie felulw out dmoepuno him to thu noum,folklore_contra
1 kifpps the story of a simpie soul art iiinovels with a philosophy by h g wells london macmillan  co 1905 2 the divine fire by may sinclar london constable  co 1904 3 the difficult way by mabel deamer london smith elder  co 1905 4 the garden of allah by robert ehcimhns london methuen  co 1904 mjore than once in this review at least an opinion has been expressed that the novel as a literary form is falling somewhat from its pride of place that its best period closed say before stevensons appearance and that the finest work of the prose imagination shows a drawing towards the compacter less redundant expression to be found in drama yet it must be owned that the novel if indeed it be dying dies hard and that the drama if indeed it be destined to renascence comes feebly and slowly to the birth merely considering literature as a source of amusement we note that in point of fact romances are as popular as ever whether their heroes handle rapier or revolver whether they dominate palace intrigues in france under the valois or in some imaginary principality lying about the balkans but on the stage where is their equivalent melodrama  submerged under a sea of musical comedy driven out by a mob of entertainments in which anything matters but the words even farce is disappearing unless it comes as part of a spectacle yet mr jacobs loses none of his vogueand long may he continue to make us laugh but those of the public who look as we have said to literature simply to be made to laugh to be excited over a story depend more and more on the novel or to be accurate they depend less and less on the play as for the others the intellectual party who not long ago were promised so much from the drama of ideas they poor people have little but disappointment to look back on they were to get plays which would make them think would bring them vividly face to face with the central emotions of modem life and they went with great expectations of the purging by pity and by fear which aristotleand mr walkleyhad taught them to desiderate it was not simple amusing comedy they were looking for mr pinero to do him justice was already giving them that in the happy days when mrs john woods company was playing the magistrate and kindred productions it was not simply moving situations they wanted mr h a jones if one did not look too critically was already achieving those for instance in the scene of the middleman where cyrus blenkarn burns his last sticks of furniture to keep the furnace going for his final experiment what they hoped for and what they were promised was something on a higher intellectual plane something to stay with you to modify your mindas unquestionably ibsen had modified the minds of his countrymen and their kin through scandinavia that was the programme and mr pinero mr jones and the rest were very serious about their mission and their message but unhappily it soon became apparent and increasingly apparent that there was only one matter which these gentlemen cared to think about or make other people think aboutthe interesting but by no means paramount concern of sexual relations and their social bearings if you wished to be harrowed with a tale of lapses matrimonial prematrimonial or extramatrimonial and their allotted punishment the dramatists were ready the rest was silence it appeared that none of the other issues of life were suitable for stage presentation this we repeat was disappointing for those who had expected from the regenerated stage representations of life so arranged as to suggest if not a philosophy at least a novel range of reflections and who had reflected to the point of weariness upon the various situations arising out of breaches of the seventh commandment so it has gone on recent years have seen one comedy of firstrate literary merit full of a farreaching irony achieve a considerable successas successes go but there has been only one admirable crichton and meanwhile mr g b shaw has been for all these years in play after play tossing about ideas as deftly as freely and often almost as aimlessly as a conjurer juggles with balls and the stage and the public have barely noticed his existence nowadays indeed he begins actually to be produced at london theatres and from any point of view but the orthodox theatrical one he is famous but if his talent so ingenious so witty so observant and with all its freakishness so sane had thrown itself into novelwriting who doubts that mr shaw would have been accepted long ago not only by a small number but by a very large public for the public shows no repugnance to ideas so long as they are produced in print indeed it might be argued that the characteristic type of the novel in these days is that which makes its appeal to readers not so much by the story it tells as by the range of ideas which it presents and illustrates mrs humphry ward has strong claims to be regarded as the typically successful novelist of this generation and mrs ward someone said sees men and women as ideas walking true niece of her illustrious uncle she provides each of her heroes and heroines with a complete and logically interdependent system of ideas and the drama in her best novel helbeck of bannisdale is the collision between two such complete and logically interdependent systems this is not to deny that helbeck and lucilla are human beings but if one calls up tom jones and his sophia becky sharp and rawdon crawley clara middleton and sir willoughby and as many more figures as one chooses from the great assembly created by the earlier novelists even by men interested in character rather than in action it will seem clear that their creators value them primarily as human beings whereas mrs wardand in some measure george eliot before heris concerned chiefly with the influence of certain intellectual convictions on the lives of certain human beings being only human herself when it comes to dealing with opinions she does not withhold her adherence from this or that belief she preaches and she teaches explicitly rather than implicitly a philosophy a system of thought detachable from the particular relation in which she presents it and this we contend is increasingly the way of the modem novelist though that way has many variations to illustrate our view we have chosen from the books of this present year two stories that have absolutely nothing in common but merit linking with each a novel of an earlier crop by its natural affinities in the one case of subject in the other of ideas the first of our cases is peculiar it is highly probable that nine readers out of ten will ignore the philosophy which underlies mr wellss admirable novel and to be quite candid that philosophy is not explicit is not even adequately suggested in kipps yet anybody who has read mr wells for the last three or four years and considered his work as a whole will readily concede in the first place that mr wells has a philosophy and in the second that he is in black earnest about it mankind in the making was a desperately serious study of the problem which mr wells presented characteristically by picturing mankind as human beings massed in one great room into which a gigantic spout discharged automatically eight babies per second the question was how to deal with the babies and the supply of babies it is no part of our purpose to criticise his constructive philosophywhich aimed at creating a sort of platonic state governed by a committee of men of sciencefarther than to remark that of all nightmares which mr wellss prolific fancy has brought forth this is by far the most terrifying but consider in the light of that series of grave economic and political essays his extravaganza the food of the gods and its allegoric intention becomes apparent the food of the gods is a chemical preparation invented casually by a man of science which so supplements the waste in tissue that it renders growth continuous instead of jerky and by consequence increases tenfold or thereabouts the development of every living thing treated with it in the first instance rats and other vermin get hold of it and become a scourge but the human beings produced under this treatment are more than a match for gigantic rats they grow so portentously that society endeavours to prohibit the manufacture of the famous food and the end is wara war of a few gullivers against the lilliputians here you have in a figure mr wellss view that if only men of science had a free hand they could alter the race of man and the face of the globe out of all recognition give to your committee of savants first of all a control of marriage so as to ensure a physically and mentally sound offspring then a control of education so that the fruit of these selected unions may be properly brought up and you will very soon have a breed of physical and intellectual giants but for the moment the men of science have no control nature and society pull along together not very equally yoked hampering rather than helping each other and what is the result  the result iskipps mr kipps is produced for our inspection firstly to amuse and interest us but certainly also in order that we may all of us know what the present system does in the way of turning out citizens that we may realise what it means to be bred up in that state of life which naturally prompts a young man to become a drapers apprentice for in truth we are made to feel acutely that mr kipps is a worm and no man that he is socially physically intellectually contemptible and it needed an artist of no common order to convey at the same time that morally kipps is more than respectableto command for him actual liking and sympathy the practical suggestion is just thisthat birth education and the whole fabric of our world have conspired to unfit kipps for any but the meanest uses but that there lie in him possibilities which rationally developed in a sane social order would have made himwell a very goodhearted and courageous little gentleman yet mr wells is too studious of his art to stress his moral careful not to harrow our feelings unduly he prefers to insinuate ideas under the cloak of drollery and above all he is too fond of mr kipps to deal ungently with him we are left to think out for ourselves the gloomier reflections which flow as corollaries from the natural history of this amiable little counterjumper the natural history is contained in the early part of the story which describes kippss education and early career before chance removed him from his normal sphere and set his qualities and endowments in a new light and here mr wells is absolutely relentless let us thank providence that he felt no hankering after realism for a story of kippss life as it would have been lived out barring the sport of fortune which tossed him to the pinnacle of twelve hundred a year would be of all imaginable books the most depressing mr wells is content simply to shadow in the possibility with a few trenchant phrases he finds a humaner and pleasanter way of commenting on mr kippss education by showing how the training which made him readily and without more than common reluctance take the mould of a drapers assistant had also perfectly unfitted him for freedom kipps was an orphan and illegitimate moreover his mother left him to the care of an uncle and aunt who kept a small shop in a southern seaside town the illegitimacy did not greatly matter as his uncle and aunt after the fashion of their class in england kept themselves to themselves and did not willingly associate with their neighbours nevertheless kipps in early boyhood and in school holidays made a momentous friendship with the boy next doorsid pornickand also with ann sids sister mr wells describes with a fine gusto the days of playing pirates along the foreshore somewhere by dungenessdays which were all the more delightful by contrast to school for kipps since he was too well come of to be sent to a board school went to an academy for young gentlemenand it is quite evident that in mr wellss ideal commonwealth no such private adventurers in pedagogy as the head of this institution will be allowed that brief section is written in vitriol as to the resultsonly incidentally does mr wells indicate that kipps retiring from his intellectual trainingground to begin the practical business of life could not read penny novelettes with the same facility as his comrade sid pornick that was at the age of fourteen in that same lucid interspace between school and apprenticeship he  made his first tentative essays at the mysterious shrine of love a race with ann pornick the sight of her flushed face and tossed hair began it sids penny novelettes and sids own declared passion for the rectors daughtera distant goddessinflamed the desire to ave a girl just to talk to and all that and the emotions culminated in a walk with ann and the endeavour to break a sixpence it was ann who accomplished the breaking of the coin in time to hand itas a peace offering after some coolnessto kipps setting out on the bus for folkestone and mr shalfords drapery bazaar kipps when inexorable fate in mr wellss words propelled him towards the distributing branch of the social service was by the nature of his training indistinct in his speech confused in his mind and retreating in his manners had he been so unfortunate as to be born a german mr wells hints he might have been educated in an elaborate and costly special  school to fit him for his end but in a country of robust individualism he was left to be trained in a practical manner by the man who having himself succeeded as a draper should best be fitted to make others succeedin this case mr shalford vitriol again supplies the fluid for the description of this new stage in the training of  an imperial englishman the flesh and blood of the picture has to be left out here but we may quote a passage where the dramatic method is abandonedand where at least the destructive part of mr wellss social philosophy becomes tolerably explicit  the indentures that bound kipps to mr shalford were antique and complex they insisted on the latter gentlemans parental privileges they forbade kipps to dice and game they made him over body and soul to mr shalford for seven long years the crucial years of his life in return there were vague stipulations about teaching the whole art and mystery of the trade to him but as there was no penalty attached to negligence mr shalford being a sound practical business man considered this a mere rhetorical flourish and set himself assiduously to get as much out of kipps and to put as little into him as he could in the seven years of their intercourse what he put into kipps was chiefly bread and margarine infusions of chicory and teadust colonial meat by contract at threepence a pound potatoes by the sack and watered beer if however kipps chose to buy any supplementary material for growth mr shalford had the generosity to place his kitchen resources at his disposal freeif the fire chanced to be going he was also allowed to share a bedroom with eight other young men and to sleep in a bed which except in very severe weather could be made with the help of his overcoat and private underlinen not to mention newspapers quite sufficiently warm for any reasonable soul in addition kipps was taught the list of fines and how to tie up parcels to know where goods were kept in mr shalfords systematised shop to hold his hands extended upon the counter and to repeat such phrases as  what can i have the pleasure  no trouble i ssure you  and the like to block fold and measure materials of all sorts to lift his hat from his head when he passed mr shalford abroad and to practice a servile obedience to a large number of people but he was not of course taught the  cost mark of the goods he sold nor anything of the method of buying such goods nor was his attention directed to the unfamiliar social habits and fashions to which his trade ministered the use of half the goods he saw sold and was presently to assist in selling he did not understand materials for hangings cretonnes chintzes and the like serviettes and all the bright hard whitewear of a wellordered house pleasant dressmaterials linings stiffenings they were to him from first to last no more than things heavy and difficult to handle in bulk that one folded up unfolded cut into lengths and saw dwindle and pass away into that mysterious happy world in which the customer dwells kipps hurried from piling linen tablecloths that were collectively as heavy as lead to eat off oilcloth in a gaslit diningroom underground and he dreamed of combing endless blankets beneath his overcoat spare undershirt and three newspapers so he had at least the chance of learning the bleginnings of philosophy two sentences may be extracted from the detailed description of the servitude in which kipps found himself his work began at 630 am and rarely much later than nine a supper of bread and cheese and watered beer awaited him downstairs and that consumed the rest of the day was entirely at his disposal for reading recreation and the improvement of his mind    the front door was locked at halfpast ten and the gas in the dormitory extinguished at eleven as promotion occurred kipps became so much less of a slave that he had apprentices under him and might cuff them but it is to be feared that in mr wellss judgment even carshot and buggins the chief shopwalkers were not absolutely free men the deeper aspects of the question are presented to kipps by a refractory apprentice  when you get too old to work they chuck you away said minton  lor  you find old drapers everywheretramps beggars docklabourers busconductorsquod anywhere but in a crib dont they get shops of their own   lord  ow are they to get shops of their own  they avent any capital  hows a drapers shopman to save up five hundred pounds even  i tell you it cant be done you got to stick t6 cribs until its over i tell you were in a blessed drainpipe and weve got to crawl along it till we die  all the misery of the business is presented by mr wells only in the beginning while kipps was still raw dimly he perceived the thing that had happened to him how the great stupid machine of retail trade had caught his life into its wheels a vast irresistible force which he had neither strength of will nor knowledge to escape this was to be his life until his days should end no adventures no glory no change no freedom when he went home for his first holidays mr shalford allowed ten days in the year sid and ann had vanishedthey also caught he had a brief moment of despair but no revolt and thenhere mr wells shows his geniussuffering ceased kipps settled down into his position one sectionthe lastsection of the preliminary part of the bookis devoted to the distractions of his adolescence the love affairs of the drapers shopaneemic paltry flirtations engagements which as mr wells explains are essentially more refined less coarsely practical and altogether less binding than the engagements of the vulgar rich puerile silly ineffectual paddling where it is decreed that men  must sink or swim perhaps on the whole it is only an exceptionally careless reader who will not realise that mr wells is intimating some dissatisfaction with the existing order such a life as kipps is living is no life for a man even mr kipps himself realises the narrowness of his cage and by reason of the spark unsubdued yet unsuspected that is in him he cranes over the edge till he topples over out of his allotted place the day comes when he falls in love in other wise than in any of his six engagements here is the history some vague desire for selfimprovement took him to a woodcarving class on the thursday evenings mr shalford had been impelled to fall in with an early closing movement and at the carving class miss helen walsingham presided she was beautiful and her conversation upon general subjects with friends of hers who frequented the room filled kipps with an abysmal sense of his own inferiority for a series of evenings he adored living from one thursday to the next and miss walsingham was conscious of his adoration as a droll and not unpleasing fact then the classes ended and with their ending comes the transition to humorous extravaganza on the first vacant thursday kipps moodily pondering suicide collides with a bicyclist who in making compensation by lavish hospitality announced himself as an unacted dramatist kipps in his genial company gets drunk spends the night out and next morning is dismissed by mr shalford a few pages suggest grimly though vaguely the process of  cribhunting but worse than the uncertainty of employment is the prospect of exile from folkestone and the carving class then upon kipps in his blackest despair mr chitterlow the dramatist descended with an advertisement inquiring for arthur kipps five days later mr kipps was in the possession of a fortune and after a reasonable interval engaged to miss helen walsingham here is where the analogy with miss sinclairs book comes in the divine fire records also the history of a young man who loves out of his class but miss sinclair can hardly be accused of a philosophy her task has been to reconcile readers to a hero without aitches savage keith rickman is a poeta poet indubitable triumphant accepted straight oif by those who know more than that physically a fine specimen of young manhood and under no embarrassment in his relations with the ladies who share his boarding house or even with miss poppy grace of a celebrated musichall but confronted with a lady who inherits money culture and everything else in a concatenanation accordingly he becomes like mr kipps retreating in his  manners like mr kipps terribly embarrassed with a teacup and in moments of emotion he is liable to drop an aspirateworse still to know that he has dropped it miss sinclair does not challenge the accepted code she gives their full and appalling significance tothese trifles literally light as airthese breathings more or less to make up for mr rickmans omissions she endows him with a quixotism that would be almost preposterous were he not a poet and she is careful to delay his final triumph till the english tongue has no longer any pitfalls for him at the same time she is careful to guard her heroine lucilla from the reproach of any unheroic insistence on social qualifications influences are constantly at work which display mr rickman in a false light but essentially miss sinclair conforms rickman with good looks education and the assured success of a genius which imposes itself by sheer mastery is nevertheless all but impossible as a mate for the finely bred lady because of social inexperience and a trick of speech that society has chosen out for a special stigma mr wells on the other hand is by implication a challenger of convention kipps in his shopman period is a person with whom helen can shake hands across the counterto show her largeness of mind kipps with twelve hundred a year is a person whom helens relations regard as a suitable match for her with twelve thousand or thirty thousand or a hundred thousand a yearthe precise figure does not matterhe would be regarded as a suitable match for a lady of miss lucilla hardens standing miss sinclair would doubtless declare that no amount of money would induce lucilla to overlook deficient aitches but miss sinclair is obliged to provide her aitchless hero with what is as rare even as the possession of a million or two and in certain societies carries as much distinction the supreme literary gift she as we have said is conformist and practically accepts the principles that certain purely formal defects mi education should constitute between a man who is liable to them and a woman who is not a gulf which only some portentous accident can bridge over whereas mr wells is evidently of opinion that the whole framework of society is absurdly adjusted as anybody can see from the case of mr kipps kipps is a person artificially made vulgar with a mind that has acquired nothing but vulgar ideas because none but vulgar ideas were ever put into it yet possessing in his own nature springs of generosity and chivalry and high aspirations after honour the beautiful helen is a person cultivated up to the limit of her capacity conscious that nothing but the lack of larger financial means debars her from a distinguished social success and therefore willing to accept mr kipps and his income as a means to the way of life that she desires confiding in her own ability to make even of kipps something not wholly discreditable intellectually kipps is dominated by his surroundings all the guidance in his mind teaches him that in marrying helen he is on the way to undreamed promotion if he is saved he has to thank his instincts for from the moment of his engagement helen has no charm for him but instinct has a tough battle and without the vigorous help of ann pornick it would certainly not have won even so after kipps and ann have eloped from the very scene of his detested splendouror rather from the kitchen below the diningroom which was the arena of his social ordealthe influence of helen and her circle still makes itself felt kipps continues to try to impose upon ann the standards of behaviour which they laboured to instil into him nature does not triumph over vulgarity till helens brother has made away with kippas fortune and left him and ann free and happy in a rational existence in the earlier days of their union it seems as though the whole social order conspired against themmore especially in the persons of house agents and architects against whom mr wells frames a venomous indictment the kippses cannot manage to live as they want to live they must live as is expected of people with twelve hundred a year ann the wholly untutored contends for common sense but kipps still has hankerings after the proper thing and there is a scene of true pathos where ann is left crying beside the uneaten buttered toast because kipps has banged the door in disgust on learning that she had denied herself to the visit of the local dean and his wife it would be grossly unfair to call mr wellss very delightful and humorous story a tractate on education but nevertheless there is hardly a page of it which does not bear evidence of the authors central concern mr wells does not mean to imply that money is a bad thing but surely he does imply that it is a bad thing to train a young man so that he cannot use the opportunities which a command of money offers he does not assert that shopkeeping is a degrading occupationon the contrary he grows lyrical over the charms of owning a drapers shop but he does emphasise the degrading effect of service in a shop conducted like mr shalfords and he certainly does not regard mr shalford as an exception and at the back of it all nowhere expressed but everywhere implied is an angry even a bitter assertion that the foundation of any rational social order ought to be selfrespect while the foundation of the social order under which imperial englishmen like mr kipps exist is servile veneration for something which they cannot be it is a far cry from mr wells and  kipps to mrs dearmer and the difficult wayfarther still to mr hichens and the garden of allah yet there is just this in common to the three books each ends as a novel should end on a sense of stable equilibrium something is settled for good and all in a life or lives kipps at the last end discovers himself and that is the end of education to that point also mrs dearmer and mr hichens have to bring their chief charactersand the chief figure of each book is a woman let us first sketch mrs dearmers it begins where so many novels leave off with a marriage nan the art student marries the reverend john pilgrim and goes to share his poverty in a south london cure of souls but nan has no concern with the souls frankly pagan she regards love as the whole of existence and her single object is to squander happiness on her husbandto pamper him with love in the moments when he is free from work which she regards as irrelevant and alien in other ways too she is bent to pamper him he has no sense of what things cost and though bills accumulate he guesses nothing and she determines to monopolise this trouble so the seed of tragedy is sown springing out of kind intentions pilgrim forbids his wife to try to earn money holding that if she wishes to work her energies should go to the parish and she cannot explain to him her need of money without betraying what she chooses to keep from him she prefers to attempt earning without his knowledge and so concealment begins her first essay is at selling her verses but this fails then when creditors grow importunate she has the inspiration of offering to sit as a model to roger wentworth her comrade of artstudent daysand though she does not dream of it her lover thus between the two lie growing reticences john pilgrim is only half convinced by his wise old friend and hers father peter that it is better not to force religion on nan but to trust her love to work out its own salvation while nan on her side has her secrets and the link between them reduces itself almost to bare passion john pilgrim is more and more conscious that his wife forces him to a choice between her and the whole tenor of his life that she does indeed make his happiness and his misery and the sense of his abasement is keen when he discovers lighting by chance on a letter from some editor respecting the verses she has tried to sell that she deceives him for that once father peter can console him by explaining that nans object has been to earn money not for luxuries but for his food and a flaming scene follows when there seems a new beginning a new marriage for husband and wife yet even in that moment a light word bears in upon john pilgrim how precarious is his happiness how he holds nan and her warm beauty  precariously  and by the connivance as it were of death a memorable phrase surely that mrs dearmer has created and even in that moment nan eager to unbosom herself to the utmost sees her husbands face wan and withholds from him the truth of her sitting to roger lest he should refuse to allow these earnings to continue there is nothing in the book more pathetic than the suggestion of the girls misguided selfmartyrdom her unutterable longing for the peace of full understanding her impulse to give up the whole game and thenthe sound of her husbands coughing fit that checks her on the very brink of explanation the tragedy bursts full of course when the time comes and some busy lady in the parish writes the lamentable result of her observations john pilgrim forgets that he has already misjudged his wife and only remembers that she has already deceived him secret now as herself he tracks her to roger wentworths door and nan returns radiant from the last but one of her sittings her hands full of primroses and wallflowers to find a very madman before her for disease has conspired with jealousy to work its will on the man that night nan spends in the passage beating till she is worn out at the locked door of her husbands room and in the endless hours her soul goes down into torment her husband has ceased to love her what was physical pain to this  softnessease yet here in this purging by fiery torment was the beginning of triumph mrs dearmers philosophy is a glorification of the uses of pain she would say we fancy that her nan had always shrunk from painpain to herself the pain which she most dreaded the pain of fear for her husbands health yet had always conceived of herself as shrinking from giving pain to her husband now her discipline is by scourging until the very faculty to feel is,folklore_contra
poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr

she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,folklore_contra

yorkshire oddities incidents aud strange events by s baringgould ma in two volumes london  john hodges 1875 to ono familiar with the stories and traditions of yorkshire there is perhaps not much new matter to be gathered from this amusing compilation it is no slight acquisition however to county literature to have such biographical curiosities collected within the compass of two handy volumes and new interest is imparted to the subject by though literary skill displayed by mr baringgould in handling his materials he is very happy too in his attempts to reproduce on pajier the dialect of that part of the west riding with which he seems best acquainted among the less widelyknown characters whose history has been unearthed by mr baringgould is dr john hildrop rector of wath near ripon about the middle of last century he was a man of obscure birth who had worked himself up in the world by his talents aud great conversational powers the story of his presentation to the living is well worth repeating lord ailesbury the patron surprised hildrop with the offer of it at a time when he was regarding himself as utterly hopeless helpless and friendless amazed at such generosity he waited upon his lordship to express all decent and grateful acknowledgments but was roughly though goodnaturedly cut short with  sir pray spare your speeches and keep your compliments to yourself you arc under no manner of obligation to me for had i known a moro deserving man in england than yourself you should not have had it dr hildrop published anonymously many volumes and detached essays little known at the present time though some of them were clever and witty enough in their own day to be attributed to swift some very good anecdotes of this gifted man are told in these pages memoirs of remarkable clergymen indeed fill up no inconsiderable space in this enumeration of yorkshire oddities the living of leaseholme in the north riding was held by three successive generations of the wikeses for upwards of a century all of them men of great literary talents popular preachers eccentric in character and much given to the bottle the first of the family who held the living was presented to it by charles h not for any theological attainments which he possessed but as a reward to an old soldier of his father for wikes when a captain in the army of charles i had received a wound in his leg which incapacitated him from further active service and no more economical method of pensioning him could bo suggested another instance of rewarding bravery in arms by promotion in the church we have met with in the case of samuel drake vicar of pontefract after the restoration whose chief qualifications for though dignity of doctor of divinity appeared to bo judging by the certificates of his acquaintances his having served in the marching army or the garrisons of newark and pontefract throughout the whole civil war one of though most amusing portions of though book is the account of jemmy hirst a native of rawcliffe who used to wear a broadbrimmed hat of lambskin fully nine feet in circumference a waistcoat and breeches of many colours and yellow boots instead of pictures he would hang the walls of his room with bits of old iron and coils of rope in one place an old fryingpan in another a rusty sword a piece of a chair or a jug the eccentricities of this man having reached the ears of george the third the king desired to have an interview with him  the following report of the conversation which passed has been preserved his majesty  asked jemmy how he liked london  i like it weel enow answered the oddity   but i hadnt any idea afore yesterday and today there were sae niony fools in it   indeed  said the king  you pay us a very poor compliment mr hirst i did not know that we were so badly olf for wisdom in london perhaps that is an article in such demand in yorkshire that thero is none to spare for cockneys   why ill tell thee how it were said jemmy  when i come into t toun yesterday and to thy house today the streets were full o crowds of folks gathered as thick as owt to see me just a cause i happd to ho dressed different frae other folk  and as i were waiting out yonder i t forechamber there were one o thy sarvants burst out laughing at me but i reckon i spoiled his ruined shirt for him and punished his impertinence one o thy sarvants was a noble duke in attendance whose loss of gravity hirst had insisted upon treating as a fit of convulsions by dashing water in his face pulling his nose and using other pretended endeavours to bring him round again strict historical accuracy even in the humble matter of dates is hardly to be looked for in such a work  unless indeed we are to accept some of these characters as greater natural oddities than mr baringgould seems to bc awtare of himself among facts related of  nancy nicholson the termagant it is hard to believe that she was born in 1718 and died in 1854 aged sixtynine that she wrote a certain letter when seventyfour years old and that important events in her career happened on february 29 1845 an eminent pedestrian we are informed walked from canterbury to london bridge twentyseven years before he was born  while a distinguished blind joiner had but sixty years of life though he was born in 1808 and died in 1873 we feel the less hesitation in drawing attention to these curious facts

the jungle book ti by rudyard kipling misc millans hitherto we have been accustomed to find inequality in mr kiplings work he has never yet given us a book entirely good each collection of his stories is a mixture of suooess and failure naturally this peculiarity has always stirred some annoyance and perplexity in his critics for at his best he is not easily surpassed while at his worst he is almost puerile there is a popular superstition not without an element of truth in it that equality and mediocrity are interchangeable terms but though no author however gifted can always be at his best the inequalities of mr kiplings work offer too startling a contrast his frequent falls from the heights to the deeps his dazzling leaps from the mire to tne mountain top cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any theory however respectable so we are unable to take up a new volume of his without knowing our hopes are dogged by a most uncomfortable fear faith in his ultimate suooess is founded tpon the fact that the more di cult his task seems though greater though certainty that he will be successful consequently if he wishes to sustain his reputation he must refuse resolutely to write on subjects commonplace or indifferent the jungle book has been cordially welcomed and it is only just to confess at once that it is more carefully designed than anything he has yet given to us there are no serious blemishes in the style and grammar as a pieoe of technique it is quite blameless but a serious doubt arises as to whether the matter of the book is at all worthy of the labour bestowed on it again it is certain that thoso flashes of genius that used to dazlo us seldom illumine its pages in them mr kiplings finest qualities are to seek we prefer to hear his men and women talk as only mulvaney or mrs hawkesby can talk be bagheora and baloo never so ingenious it is impossible to rid oneself of the conviction that any author rather more clever than the average could have contrived though greater part of th jungle book there are indeed a few pages that no one but the creator of soldiers three could have written and one new friendship is cemented for whioh we are grateful rikki tikki though only a mongoose fights his way stuantly enough into the list of mr iplings immortals the history of his war with the cobras is entirely delightful and refuses to be forgotten there are times when plain speaking is necessary and then the most ardent admirer of an author must if he be honest say the truth though truth is that the jungle book had it been written by a person unknown might have stirred a languid interest and a cor ta in reasonable hope of better things to come as the work of a man of recognised genius it compels disappointment it is generally true that to gain a worthy success a writer must toil hard must choose his words with discrimination but there is no rule without an exception and in this case mr kipling would seem to be that exception his best work achieves itself apparently spontaneously it is a startling nay dangerous thing to say of a man that he places failure far from him only when he is most careless but mr kipling may at any rate be advisedadapting a remark of mr henleys not to concern himself again with words and phrases but with the greater truths of destiny and emotion his last bcok prompts this reflection few authors know the human heart so well as he let him forsake thereforo mowglis and mules and monkeys and remember that his vital phrases have ever been born not made percy addleshaw  the jungle book  the jungle book is made up of story and song both of them rich in vitality and imagination but every time a verse occurs as the heading of a chapter one is inclined to think that mr kipling should write nothing

fought for freedom and it is yours eat it o wolves there is something sternly grand about all the mowgli stories imaginative children whether or not they follow the narrative with perfect comprehension will be impressed and even awestruck by the solemnity and dignity of jungle life as mr kipling paints it of the habits of the animals of the scenes amidst which they live he has a marvellous knowledge it is this picturesqe knowledge joined to a vigorous interpretation of not their own character but the ideal nature he has constructed for them a nature at once remote and familiar to us that makes the success and the fascination of the stories man without his intellectual power but with his natural faculties of sight and hearing infinitely intensified and without the enfeeblement the deceit the pettiness that are the fruits of his civilisation would be something like this conception of the beast that obeys the jungle law we are grotesquely reminded here and there of the ideals of rousseau and the natural state idealists their primitive man they would have desired to be like mr kiplings loyal beasts there are stories in the book where he is not at his highest point of vigour  the white seal  comes near to being a failure and so does  servants of the queen the adventures of rikkitikkitavi the mongoose that fought with nag the cobra and nagaina his wife are too deadly to be amusing and the glamour of imagination does not play round them to turn the terror into fascination the temperature of ones admiration having been reduced by these we find several other things to wonder at not all admiringly mr kipling cannot resist opportunities of political allusion indeed invents them and his love for playing the schoolmaster grows on him it is this quality that is at the bottom of the imperfect sympathy which runs parallel in many readers minds with a warm admiration for him the pedagogue in him hides under free and vigorous and unconventional speech but he is mostly there were he to fall asleep a bit oftener and let some careless lawless fellow take his place if even only for a few minutes mr kiplings range of understanding of human nature would be greatly widened but grumbling at mr kiplings temperament is not very relevant here it does not greatly offend in  the jungle book more to the purpose is it to point to the feats of imagination in these beast stories next to the three mowgli tales for great qualities comes  toomai of the elephants toomai is a little boy who saw what few be lieved in and none had seen the great  dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the garo hills he was on the back of the tame elephant kala nag that he tended and when kala nag got the signal for the dance the boy was born away up the wooded hill through the thick underwood through the bed of a river to a space of three or four acres where the grass was trampled and hard the assembling elephants crashed through the trees and entered the danceplace and rolled their eyes and tossed their trunks and clicked their tusks and flicked their great tails  then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs and a dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little toornai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the ground onetwo onetwo as steadily as tripbammers the elephants were stamping altogether now and it sounded like a wardrum beaten at the mouth of a cave the dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall and the booming went on and the ground rocked and shivered and little toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound but it was all one gigantic jar that ran through hinmthis stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth    the morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills and the booming stopped with the first ray as though the light had been an order it is a magnificent sight that toomai saw that night when the favour of the elephantfolk and of the gods of the jungle was with him mr kipling has some splendid visions for all his love of discipline and order it is when his spirit gets away into the wilder paths of nature and human nature that he touches

wideawake stories a collection of tales told by little children between sunset and 8unrise in the panjab and kashmir by f a steel and r c temple bombay education societys press london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the

wonderful stories from northern lands by julia goddard with an introduction by the rev george w cox ma longmans  co this is not a xeya 3ixov and so far not a fjeya kolkov it is a volume consisting of xxivf208 pages large clear print and containing thirteen stories nine of which are eddaic the rest with the exception of the romance of frithiof and ingibjorg purely legendary miss goddard informs us that no use has yet been made of the materials of the eddas and sagas of northern europe for the amusement and the instruction of the young a statement which if it is meant to have the sense the words convey does not speak very highly of miss goddards knowledge of the history of english literature  in the belief therefore that these materials may be presented in a form as delightful as that of the old stories with which all are familiar we do not know what old stories she alludes tomiss goddard  has clothed a few of the edda and other narratives in language which she trusts  the youngest child may understand with ease and from which even they who have left childhood behind them may derive some enjoyment this the  author  considers to be the object of her work and a sufficiently insignificant object it ia to be sure if eddaic lore is meant to pass through a process of worddilution in order that the verbiage thereof may be suited to the intellect and the capacities of the nursery we really think the old book had better be left alone the beauties of its contents do not consist in words nor will any clothing of them into language which the youngest child may understand make any difference as to their actual import but before we argue this point further it is neces sary to take mr coxs introduction into consideration to mr cox most things are solarmyths and every tale which happens to have some one point in common with another tale is forthwith declared to be identical with it we do not understand how in the misty region of legend and fancy all things can be fused together into a sort of living organism on the score of common external similarities unless these resemblances are ascertained to be something more at all events than purely accidental the everlasting recurrence of kindred ideas in a similar dress does not in our opinion constitute any inner kinship beyond this that the impressions of similar external circumstances will act upon the intellectual faculties of man in such a way as to bring about similar evolutions and expressions a sunset inspired the heart of a greek and that of a hyperborean most probably with similar sentiments both might possibly give vent to them in similar language the symbols and similes made use of by either might be of striking resemblance but what is the nature of the relationship between both 1 what right have we on the strength of their external appearance to declare them to be one and the same tale none they are two different expressions of a universal human feeling the true similarity between this tale and that is only found in the radical and originative elements of both not in the often accidentally similar accessories of their outward form when outward points of resemblance are taken as infallible criteria of the identity not only of myths but also of mythic heroes and gods we do not wonder to find baldr the fair identified with 7r6cas ukvs axtaacis by mr cox on the ground that both are  vulnerable only in one part a theory which becomes sufficiently preposterous when we take into consideration that the common point of resemblance alleged has no existence at all in the case of baldr this one instance may serve as a specimen of mr coxs introduction which in reality is nothing but an index of tales which he considers similar to or identical with those contained in the present volume that baldr means the sun and that the myths about him are pure solarmyths seems to be a settled matter among students of myths but we believe that mr cox stands alone in the identification of the northern god with achilles and with all possible deference for mr coxs opinion on the subject we venture to doubt that the two have anything in common at all perfectly possible and probable as it is that the myth of baldr is a solarmyth we cannot withhold here the observation that it may also with full justice be considered as a myth of life as well all myths are poems the deeper the poem the wider its relation is the more profound its philosophy the more clear its application for genius is allsided it is not to be supposed that the ideal and creative faculty of humanity in ancient ages was unfit for any poetical productions but solarmyths pure and simple or that man was merely endowed with a faculty of gazing at the sun and personifying him in all manner of conceivable and inconceivable adventures and yet was unable to penetrate into the mysteries of the human heart the myth of baldr seems to us to be quite as much a poem of blighted hopes as of the sun being slain by the darkness of winter the mistletoe a parasitic sapling the most trifling of causes becomes in the hand of a blind and unmeaning agency an element of destruction whereby the most cherished aspirations in lifethe very delight of gods and men is buried in the dark night of sorrow and the light of hope love and affection is engulfed in despair even at a moment when every one had given himself up to the fullest enjoyment of it in the fond belief that their watchful care has been rewarded by the full security and safety of the object of their admiration and love on the other hand it is a lesson the victory won by the gods has rendered them listless in continuing their watch and regardless of a trifle which at a glance seems by its very insignificance to preclude the possibility of any hurtful element being inherent in its nature this disregard of the possibility of danger arising from even the slightest causesthis want of an allsided heed and unsparing selfresearch bears in itself the germ of its own revenge let innocence and virtue rear ever so strong a defence against temptation and passionlet it be proof against any open forces of the dangers which beset its path there always must remain unguarded some byway or other offering an access no matter how narrow  for absolute perfection is unattainable this weak point the tempter is sure to find out he awaits the moment when he can turn it to his best advantage and the sunbright innocence is stung to the heart and faints away into the arms of death and darkness and a cry of lamentation goes through the whole of nature and the universe is changed into a fountain of tears this interpretation without at all precluding the solar theory will force itself upon any one who has carefully examined the mode in which antiquity regarded life and nature in their everlasting reciprocity of impression and reacting emotion the more we try to master the ancient philosophy and poetry of the north the more we shall become convinced that their range is far wider than a deified personification of the changing seasons of the year they who give themselves up te the confident belief that all ancient myths are solarmythr pure and simple will find themselves in the end we fear much in the case of baldr and be wounded by the mistletoe of onesidedness hurled from the nevermissing hand of the blind hbftr what we have said already may we think suffice to convince our readers that the eddaic lore is essentially unsuited for the nursery so long as nothing more is done towards revealing its spirit and meaning than clothing several of its tales in nursery speech we therefore strongly object to the venerable book being taken in vain as our author has done merely that children may have a thoughtless glance at this tale or that and then throw the book away not a whit wiser than they were on receiving it to render the tales of edda into a fancy language without one hint at the deeper meaning of the subjects treated is fruitless labour are not the stories of edda parables or allegories are children not expected to comprehend the lessons of the parables of the gospel 1 are the former so much more difficult to explain than the latter as to render the task unfeasible  by no means the obvious points in a parable no matter what its nature is suggest themselves to any intellect almost and if children cannot understand eddaic lore when its deeper sense and import is explained to them is it to be supposed that they can find any desirable enjoyment or instruction in that very lore when left totally unexplained 1 but people will answer what good would that do to children  and our only reply is the counterquestion what good is the tale itself to children unless their thought is awakened by teaching them what they cannot understand by themselves we have seen in mr freemans old english history for children that the nursery is really not too humble a hovel for science to visit we do not see why mythology should lag behind the first step to making eddaic tales acceptable to children would be to translate the names of them the local no less than the personal ones this our author has not even tried to do  but what she has attempted is to form such monstrosities as asi nominative plural of ass instead of jesir the northern gods hela for hell gyall for gjoll or gjallar bru the yell or yellbridge c why our author should presume to improve upon edda in the narrative of thors journey to utgartsaloki and let the old hag with whom the god of thunder has to fight be death instead of elli or eld old age one of the most poetical points in the whole of that late concoction of illusions we confess we are unable to understand if it were not for the venerable source whence the stories in the present volume are drawn and the manner in which they are done which it is quite desirable should not be imitated in future we should not have found this item of the english literature of 1871 worthy of notice  iflontvefu stories from arorhern zands  by juiia goddard longmans 2nd edition 1871 whatever miss julia goddard takes in hand whether it be a tale or a poem for a magazine or an essay on a more solid and serious subject she is apt to execute with so much of good sense and taste and in such a simple easy style that we are apparently saying very little in her praise when we assert that among all the writers of the day there is no one who stands before her as a masteror mistressof the art of writing for children accordingly we were quite prepared on seeing wonderfful stories on the table before us to find in its pages the old norse tales which for ages have delighted so idndy boys and girls in homes in other northern nations retold in such a way as ought to make them near and dear friends in english nurseries and schoolrooms we are quite awareas miss goddard in fact reminds usthat these stories are lot new for the  household stories of grimm and dr daserits popular tales from the norse have long since introduced a very large proportion of the ancient german legends to their cars but then it is equally true that little or no use as yet has been madie in england of the materials of the eddas and sagas of northern europe  these however miss goddard now unseals to the gaze of our young people and in a style so simple so charming and so captivating that we feel sure they will never wish to have them edited by another hand it is almost needless to specify which of the contents of this volume are original and which are not but we may of course assume that our readers are none of them unacquainted with balder or thor and his hammer or iduna sips golden hair or volund they will however recognise new acquaintances in  king olaf  frithiof  christins trouble  thorwalds bridal to the volume is prefixed an admirable introduction by the rev g iv cox showing what relation these prose balladsfor such they arebear to the legends of the early greeks romans and of the natives of the indian leninsttla  or to express ourselves in his words we have thus in our hands thz clue whichn may guide uts through the mazes of folklore stories to fountains of delight which can never be drained dry it may be impossible perhaps to bring back the precise feeling which these stories may severally have inspired in those who knew but few of them but even young readers at the present day will probably have devoured not only the household stories of grimm and the norse tales of dasent but the whest highland legends of campbei the deccan tales of aliss frere the icelandic legends of powell and magniisson and many more that all these stories exhibit the same elements he must soon discover it is well that lhe should learn to draw pleasure from sources which will never fail hiim and withal grow wiser as he recognises old friends under new forms in the legends of greeks and hindus of norwegians germans spaniards and englishnen of miss godlards charming style the following passage from  king olaf may bc taken as a specimenout came running the little elves for the sudden rising of the floods had disturbed him  vho art thou bo0l mariner who sailest over our homes  behold the mountains shake with fury fell us what is thy name  quiet ye quiet ye little people answered king olaf i am saint olaf turn ye into stones until i come this way again so the little elves turned into stones and rolled down the mountain sides and the good ship went on her way she had not gone far before out came an old carline and said saint olaf i know you with your beard shining like red gold wherefore do you bring with you the waters to mock us in our dwellings your ship has burst through the wall of my chamber evil luck be with you  then saint olaf for lhe was a saint as wvell as a king fixed his glance witheringly upon the old carline  be thou turned into a flint rock said he  and so remain for ever and ever and the carline was turned into a rock and saint olaf and his crew sailed on and on so fleetly flew the good ship ox that anyone must have had good eyes to see her as she flashed past for so she sped on that if saint olaf drew his bowv and shot an arrow forward it fell far behind in the wake of the vessel this was fast sailing indeed and with such speed it is not wonderful that thoulglh harald haardradc had had the start of his brother yet saint olaf reached home three days before him  harald haardrade was wild with rage when he came those three days later and found saint olaf king of norroway and lie raged and raged until at length be became a dragon and this is the last that we hear of harald haardrade  now as saint olaf had prayed for the blessing of heaven before hie set out on his voyage it was natural that his first act upon landing should be to go to the nearest church to return thanks for having so mightily prospered  and as he walked up the crowded nave a golden glory beamed from his fair hair and the people of norroway learned a great lesson from the faith of king olaf the saint it only remains to add that the book is adorned with six exquisite illustrations by mr iv j weigand  wonderful stories from northern lands

can be too refined or beautiful for the early and familiar use of the young the standard given them in literature as in morals cannot be too high elevation need not be obscure any imore than purity need be dull the taste for creative art latent in every child who scribbles on his slate or builds his toy model cannot be too early cultivated or too soon directed to graceful and lofty forms but the growth must be gradual or it will not be permanent and the appreciation will be imitative rather than intelligent the eddas and sagas of the north with their weird yet stately mournfulness recording the anxious yearnings of humanity for reunion with its beloved after the dividing sleep of death and for an embodied divinity whose fiat would shift some of the burden of responsibility from mortal hearts too weak to bear it are sources unfit to be drawn upon for nursery amusement true the clayfooted idols wor shipped by the rude northern races were like unto themselves stern rugged often vindictive but the legends of their lives though alwayss wild sometimes grotesque are none the less sorrowful allegones of life and nature which cannot and ought not to be understood by the very young the paring and condensing and simplifying necessary to suit them to childish comprehensions narrows their purpose and obscures their meaning miss goddard has done her best with the selection before us but she was mistaken in endeavouring to adapt it to the use of the youngest child had she bestowed equal taste and care on a version for older readers her task would have been a more repaying one mr cox in his introductory essay tries to reconcile us to this utilisation of the eddas and sagas by a clever and comprehensive comparison of the legends of all countries bringing into strong relief their points of assimilation and tracing a family likeness which at the first glance seems ludicrous between the greek psyche and our homely  beauty and the beast he cites in support of his theory of unity max mullers exhaustive study of  comparative mythology yet even allowing for the sake of argument that his point is proved it does not follow that every branch of this wide family of fable affords equally appropriate material for childrens stories the disguise in wvhich thor recovers his magic hammer and slays his enemies the neglected trifle which causes the death of balder the hopeless conflict with thought and death old age in the original to which utgarda loki tempts his unwary guests have neither symmetry nor purpose when they cease to be treated as symbols the mere narrative outlines of the sagas denuded of their soul of poetry and grief are bald and colourless the result is the more to be deprecated as we are made to feel it to be so far beneath mliss goddards

legends of number nip by mark lemon illus trated by charles keene macmillan and uo the better part of the public ought to be heartily thankful to mr mark lemon for the character of the additions he has been lately making to our current literature we owe to him two original novels that are english novels in the healthiest sense good stories without distorted incident and with truth and variety in their sketches of english character he has given us our amplest budget of good sayings in an english jest book full of the genius of the people whose wit it expresses a store of pleasant occasional reading not easily to he exhausted and with the quality too rare in jest booka of containing not a line that could give offence to the moat sensitive and now here is more pleasant reading of the wholeaomest in a book that while it pleases may do something to educate the english fancy into a right sense of fairy lore it is an incorporation into english literature of the series of rubesahl legends from musseus who before the grimms were boru delighted germany with the embodiment in it literature of some of the best fairy lore found current among the people johann karl musmus who died eighty yean ago at the age of fiftytwo gave up early in life theology fur literature and began like fielding with an instinct for the parody of our bichsrdaon then very popular in germany the success

apfswod as a jest upon lavater from that time the lively wit of muemus who waa one of the kindliest of men eontinned active in the direction of all others meet kindred to his genius his charming collection of volksmhrchen or popular legends gathered from the line of the peasantry was not surpassed in the pleasant graces of narration even by the fairy tales that tieck told in his phantasus musams wrote also novelets and tales for children and some grave satire of lim and death he was rather an artist and a man of original genius than a literary antiquary and the tales he heard by the peasants spinningwheel went to the world enriched and perfected into fantastic grace half comic half poetical but always fascinating to both old and young by passing through his mind mr mark lemon has entered into the spirit of mussaus nnd tells again in the old pleasant vein how the gnome king gave a charmed wand to his beloved princess wherewith she could turn turnips into any form she chose and liow his clever bride slipped out of his enchanted castle and rejoined her mortal lover on a juicy turnip turned into a horse while the poor gnome king with his attention distracted by love was making at her desire an exact calculation of the number of turnips in a certain field because said the lady she would have them all for bridesmaids he had to count three times before he could be sure that he had got the number right and was called in derision by the mortals of his region of the riesengebiirge kiibezahl or number nip from that day forward this gnome king was a popular fairy hero and what fantastic tales are told of him we may now read in mr lemons english storybook the genial play of invention in these and like stories seems to be very difficult of attainment in this country it is wonderful to think how few good fairy tales have been produced in england as a branch of our literature they are almost unrecognized and when they are invented for the benefit of children the inventions are too commonly confections of crude wouldbe childishness with no fairylike delicacy of conception no swift ingenious imaginative turns to which the writer has for the time given heart and soul producing them with as good faith and as pure enjoyment as the poet ffeels in exercise of his own higher but not more spiritual tform of creative power our few english attempts at a ttairy tale are usually written with a visible sense of coming down to some theoretical point vulgarly supposed in this country to be the capacity of children every natural child reads under instinctive protest this makebelicve literature and should be trained to detest instead of to enjoy the part goody and part bogy style that is thought moral and educational by too many purveyors of literature for our english nurseries  legends of number nip by mark lemon illustrated by charles keene macmillan  co old playgoers will recollect how in the early days of the first of the clever family of mimes the paynes a piece founded on the famous rube zahl was produced and had a long run at covent garden what the stage then effected for the  turnip numberer mr lemon has now done through this very pretty and pleasant book he has placed  rube zahl or  number nip in the most attractive form possible before the public mr lemon has not translated the legends traditionally related by musajus but has compiled them  from a translation of musaus works published in london shortly after his death the translator introduced much that was extraneous and more that was objectionable these errors have been carefully avoided in the present volume such work may appear humble but it really is not so its usefulness cannot be disputed  and there is no want of dignity in the labour which is directed towards dividing

cossack fairy tales and folktales selected edited and translated by r nisbet bain lawrence  bullen mr nisbet bain continues his unwearied activity the success of his volume of russian folktales has induced him to give the public a selection from the stores of the malorussians or ruthenians as some people affect to call them of these miirchn there are three chief collections those of rudchenko dragomanov and kulish  and of these the richest is incomparably that of rudchenko which appeared at kiev in two volumes in 1870 we entirely agree with all that mr bain says of these tales there is a very atmosphere of legend floating about the southern russian provinces and galicia it was from these tales that gogol a malorussian by birth drew his inspiration and many others of his countrymen such as osnovianenko storozhenko and mme eugenia markevich the lady who wrote under the pseudonym of marko vovchok followed in his wake but not only those writers who used the malorussian languagefor after the opinion expressed by miklosich we hardly dare say dialectbut also polish authors have drawn largely from these sources we need only mention michal czajkoweki of the legendary poems we will on the present occasion say nothing the language has as yet been but little noticed in the west and indeed the materials for the study of it are wanting in the old times there were only a few meagre vocabularies by way of dictionary such as those of piskunov and verchrateki and there was a germanruthenian deutschruthenischen dictionary published at lemberg but the study was facilitated when the work of zhelekhovski appeared which was completed on his death by nedilski moreover there is a good little ruthenian grammar explained in german in the series now being published by hartleben of vienna whereas the excellent work of osadtsa is written in malorussian and therefore only useful to natives thus much zur orientirung mr bain has chosen his tales well and translated them with spirit and accuracy we have taken two as tests the originals of which are to be found in rudchenko  the magic egg  yaitseraitse and  the fox and the cat lisitsa ta kit they are rendered admirably and we can only sincerely congratulate mr bain on having broken ground so vigorously the tales like all those of slavonio countries aro wonderfully wild and fanciful the translators notes are few but certainly to the point we take the word div explained by zhelekhovski as bose gottheit der finsternis ot wunderthier to be of the same root as the samodiva or solitary fairy a being with malignant proclivities so often met with in the bulgarian songs pokuie the place of honour in the peasants cottage is an interesting word as the root kut is the same as the german kante english  cantle we do not quite like mr bains description of ruthenian as he terms it as a language intermediate between russian and polish of course it belongs to the southeastern branch to adopt the usual division whereas polish is a member of the western certain polonisms have undoubtedly crept into the language but this was owing to the people having been for so long a time subject to the poles as mr bain of course knows very well in fact their whole history is a constant struggle with the polish elementa struggle which has not ended in our own times aa lemberg can testify however the reader of these charming tales need not make himself uncomfortable with any of the gruesome stories about the cruelties of bogdan khmelnitski jeremy wisniowiecki or at a later seriod zheleniak and gonta mr bain as provided us with some excellent fairytales which must be new to almost all english readers it is a great pity that prof dragomanov never finished his fine work on the malorussian dumi but we can see by his contributions to the bulgarian sbornik that he continues to take an unflagging interest in folklore we there lind some of his most valuable labours in conclusion we think that mr bain is too severe in asserting that the russian government  rigoiously represses the ruthenian language the facts of the case appear to be that russia does not favour the production of new works in the language but the old are allowed to be reprinted certainly we know from our own experience that at kiev for example there is no difficulty in procuring malorussian books w r morfill,folklore

serbian folklore popular tales selected ana translated by madam csedomille mijatovies edited with an introduction by the rev w denton ma author of servia and the servians london  w isbister  co 1874 the servian stories collected by vuk stefanovich karajich and published by him at vienna in 1853 have been rendered so familiar to all students of popular tales by his daughters literal german translation which appeared at berlin in 1854 that there is no occasion to dwell upon the selections from his work which form the first third of the volume now before us of his fifty stories  madam csedomille mijatovies  has translated about a dozen the rest of her book being devoted to about as many specimens of  the  bosniacke narodne pripovijetke collected by the  society of young bosnia the first part of which collection was printed at sissek in croatia in 1870 these stories are not likely to be familiar to our readers and therefore some account of them may prove of interest in the bird girl a prince who cannot find a suitable wife is about to fling himself from the top of a high hill when he hears a voice behind him crying  stop for the sake of the three hundred and sixtyfive which are in the year then there appears an old man who tells him that on a neighbouring hilltop sits  an old woman with golden hair holding a bird in her bosom whoever can seize her by her hair without her having seen him and can take away that bird will become the happiest man in the world but the hill is covered  with the stony forms of princes whom the old woman has petrified while they were striving to gain the bird the prince of course succeeds forcing the hag to breathe  a blue wind towards the men of stone who straightway revive and to transform the bird by a kiss into a beautiful maiden who gratefully presents him with her hand and an allcompelling staff the first part of the story of  sir peppercorn is that of a wondrous child  so extremely small that they christened him  peppercorn who plays the part of our jack the giantkiller a giant has carried off peppercorns sister and killed his three elder brothers  but he rescues her and slays their murderer thc story is one frequently met with but a curious incident in it is the agreement entered into by the giant with each of his visitors that whoever of the two can devour a halfsheep first shall be at liberty to kill the other the elder brothers succumb under this trial but the youngest succeeds  at last peppercorn by trickery managed to get rid of his share of the sheep and according to the arrangement killed the giant the  trickery  is not explained it may have been similar to that which under similar circumstances jack employed towards the welsh giant the second part of the peppercorn story is that in which a demoniacal being successfully overcomes all but one of a party of companions but by that one is itself vanquished and pursued into its subterranean abode the conqueror being left to perish there by his perfidious friends but always escaping generally by means of a friendly bird the european adaptations of the story are generally somewhat commonplace as compared with the striking form it assumes in the calrauck version julgs kalmitkisclie miirchen no 3 and the bosnian variant offers no very remarkable features  bashchalek  is a curious version of the story of a prince whose three sisters are married to as many supernatural personages in this instance the kings of the dragons the falcons and the eaglesand is by them saved from a demon who has carried off his wife the demon is almost always found by the hero in a bluebeards or forbidden chamber and is freed by him in the present story the prince finds within such a room a man fast bound in iron and unable to reach though water which flows before his eyes touched by pity he not only gives the captive three draughts of the water but he also pours some of it over his head whereupon all the chains snap and the freed demon flies away with his liberators wife the story always ends with the discomfiture of the demon whoso life depends upon some external object frequently called his heart which is enclosed in a series of protecting envelopes in bash chaleks case his  strength  is in a bird which is inside the heart of a fox which is within a very high mountainan inferior series to those which figure in many of the numerous variants of the story of which  punchkin  and the giant who had no heart in his body  are the bestknown representatives in most of its features the shepherd and the kings daughter resembles other stories about an impostor who for some time enjoys the reward due to a true man but ono of its incidents is peculiar the hero acting under an old womans advice has bought a cow killed it and filled a pot with its suet this suet has the faculty of turning black people white so he carries it to  though black world where all the people aro black as chimneypots and realises a largo fortune by whitewashing its inhabitants and especially its king who is the blackest of all  one good turn deserves another  is the same story as grimms  eisenhans a supernatural being is imprisoned by a king but freed by the kings son who is consequently banished the grateful being assists the prince in all his undertakings eventually enabling him to win though hand of a fair princess though biter bit is a curious variant of the favourite tale of how a youth  who has fallen into the hands of a wizard or magician is rescued by his father ending as is thc case in many versions of the story with a series of transformations almost identical with that which the narrative of  the second royal mendicant in thc arabian nights has made so familiar bnt the opening is singular a man blessed with a hundred sons goss out in search of wives for them he long wanders fruitlessly but at last he finds a priest who is cursed with a hundred daughters and who therefore is obliged to plough his land without the aid of even so much as a boy a century of matches is arranged between the two families but on his way to the wedding the father of many sons leaves one of them at home and as the hundred brides and the ninetynine bridegrooms and the two hundred brideleaders and the two hundred witnesses and the hundred runners and the three hundred standardbearers and the rest of the party are going over a bridge it contracts and holds them all tight then a black giant appears and demands as a kind of toll that which the father of the bridegrooms has forgotten at home which is of course his overlooked son the sarao story forms the theme of  the trade that no one knows but its opening scene is formed by a valuable variant of the bluebeard story the forbidden chambers are three in number and are in a castle belonging to four giants the hero finds in the first chamber  a golden ass bound to a golden manger in the second  a very beautiful girl dressed all in gold and silver who sat combing her hair and setting in every tress a large diamond   and in the third a collection  of human heads these heads once belonged to young men like himself who having obeyed faithfully and strictly the orders of though giants had been killed by them  the three suitors  relates how three  nobles loved the same princess each having an equal claim on her affections they refer their dispute to the king her father who recommends them to settle it amicably so they all leave their native country and go into a faroff desert to live like hermits  the goldenhaired twins  is the wellknown story of the calumniated queen who is charged with having brought into the world puppies instead of princes in this variant her children are bnried alive and from above their grave spring up two trees bearing golden leaves

the blinding of an old man by vilas his eyesight is restored by means of a herb which a captured vila is forced to produce the vila being peculiar to servia and its neighbourhood all stories relating to that supernatural female are valuable the present story seems to be the original of the bohemian tale of the wicked wood fays see academy june 6 1874 p 628 the three brothers  is a strange and fatiguing medley of scraps of familiar tales but there figure in it two supernatural females of interest the first is a devouring girl who cuts her mothers throat and roasts her corpse saying the while i shall do the same with my three brothers one after the other and then i shall remain alone the mistress of the entire property she then having sharpened her teeth eats up the body of her mother all except the head the other singular female is an old woman who turns into ashes all that she touches with her little finger or the little toe of her left foot the story of ani mais as friends and enemies  is a somewhat clumsy variant of one of the numerous tales in which a hero is assisted by animals whom he has treated well the last story in the volume  the legend of st george is one of the most interesting treating as it does of the heathen people of  the troyan country a fabulous district dear to south slavonic romance on the whole these bosnian stories are not very good specimens of popular tales but they offer several points of interest to students mr denton has prefixed to the volume an introduction which ought to prove of service to the general reader containing references to a great number of authorities on folklore and giving from the writers own experience some interesting information about servian storytellers or rhapsodists we do not know if he or the translator is responsible for the references to  grimm  which figure as footnotes to the stories taken from karajichs collection jacob grimm wrote a preface to the german translation of the servian tales but that is not a sufficient reason for ascribing the book to him no reference is given in the case of  papalluga or the golden slipper  p 58  the stories are not numbered but the german version

the legends of smokeover principal jacks is better known to most of us as editor of the hibbert journal than as presiding over manchester college oxford or again as the author of a volume called  the alchemy of thought  than as the biographer of stopford brooke he has written stories beforewitness  philosophers in trouble and in and out of them has given specimens of ability as a man of wit and satire in his quarterly review we meet with him more especially as one who is versed deeply in the deeper thought of the day the present volume is at once characteristic and unexpectedcharacteristic because it has something of all the qualities just intimated and is original in its own way as he is always but unexpected also because it is like nothing that he has done previously it is in any case a book which will set its readers thinking in several vital directions if they are capable of anything that it is worth while calling thought it is not what ordinarily people would call religious and yet it makes for righteousness for one grows better in the reading as if the value of things that matter had risen suddenly in our esteem and the false values had come down to their proper level of nil smokeover is  a city much like london as shelley said once of another place which it would be invidious to mention in the present connection in a sense its legends belong to a world philosophised its economics to faerie its dramatis personae to a realm not realised where daily life is exercised normally in heroics but in a second sense which is perhaps truer the place is just like this one the people are just like some of us but a little lifted up in a motive light of otherwhere it should be said that smokeover is a state a presiding spirit rather than a place and it happens that its legends are those of rebels who are on strike for a kingdom  not founded on smoke it comes about therefore that all its personalities are types written over with eloquent meanings from head to foot and all its events are omens yet it is in the sense that we also are types full of messages for those who can read and our every event is a portent the fact that the book claims to be one of legends the divisions of which are marked plainly by italicised paragraphs after the manner of interludes does not prevent it from being an ordered story in continuity from beginning to end and the fact that it is a parable  with child of great intent does not prevent it from being as much like a novel as such a thing can well be very living too in the telling it begins in smokeover and ends on the verge of utopia amidst largess of poetical justice for those who concern the reader it is arabian nights if you like or a scheme of universal reconstruction of a very practical kind which is perhaps the same thing if it is not a guide to the perplexed like that of maimonides principal jacks is to be congratulated on a brilliant book which can be approached and appreciated from several angles including paradoxical philosophy a e w   the legends of smokeover by l p jacks us 6i hodder  stoughton,folklore
science the prowlers by f st m1ars nisbet  co a romance of animal life must needs be founded on fact if it is to carry conviction this is far from saying that nothing is to be left to the imagination of the chronicler it suffices that no behaviour incompatible with ascertained habits no incident beyond the range of probability should be introduced and that the local colour should be true that mr st mars has actually been an eyewitness of all the strange scenes he depicts is extremely unlikely but there is no question that he knows what he is talking about and that his knowledge has been acquired in the right school equally important for the narrative is his exceptional power of expression his language is virile and strenuous never slipshod and he is a master of terse and graphic description it would perhaps be ungrateful and certainly uncharacteristic of the spirit of the age to suggest that the eyes sometimes al e apt to ache with so much movement and might welcome an occasional lull battle and murder and sudden death there are on every page here are two paragraphs selected almost at haphazard after that there was a jet of flame and a report that seemed to knock the natural tranquillity of the place to little pieces it seemed also to have literally burst pigeons upwards out of the wood and to hurl them into space it scattered finches out of the hedges as dew is scattered from a bough that is shaken at early morn and it conjiured up an eruption of bronze bodies from the spots where the pheasants gathered thick and sent them into apparent hysterics again in description of the sudden vengeance of the peregrine falcon upon a usurping kite a steelcoloured flash a burst of feathers a wild hurtling feathered mass shooting earthwards at appalling speed thena division of the mass into two parts the peregrine wings  threshing furiously tail outspread body thrown back checking her miad career the kite blasted from life a smashed and crumpled heap turning over and over as it fell and finally vanishing crashing into the upper branches among the oaks this is undeniably vivid on the other hand the candid critic may here and there see traces of incipient mannerisms and twists of languagewhich effective enough in themselves tend to become inept by repetition we presently detect the juggler in words who is too prone to repeat his tricks to take one example only there must be a score of sentences beginning thus followed an infernal chattering  followed a leap a thud a dry rustle of feathers a squawk   followed a swirl a hissing bubbling boiling rush andchaos followed a sudden chaos and a miniature whirligig i is there not something amiss with mr st marss title  there is perhaps no reason to apply the name  prowlers exclusively to fourfooted animals but we were a little surprised to find that about half of the dramatis per8ona in the book were birds the marauders is the title of one of the tales and would be appropriate enough for the whole collection it is entirely a matter of individual taste which of these thirteen stories should be awarded the palm for excellenceany one has just as strong claims as another while it would be a still more invidious task to determine which should be excluded if their number had to be reduced to twelve some of them have been previously published in magazines and it is curious that in their present arrangement the first appears to be properly a sequel to the seventh in three only does mr st mars resort to dialogue one being that which tells of the thrilling and unsuccessful attempt of a family of stoats to stop a  flitting  of rats and how the desperate siege in a woodpeckers hole was raised by the white owls incidentally we may note that among all the  prowlers  the author seems to show a partiality for any of the weasel tribe whereas he has not a good word to sav of the rats he endorses the stoats estimate of them as garbageeating carrionhunting flatfooted goblineared ullagesmelling cannibalistic offal and again  nakedtailed nakedfooted scum and the part they play is indeed revolting though the scene of these adventures is laid in england mr st mars has boldly declined to be handicapped by the limits of our fauna and has introduced such characters as the covote the american crow and a pair of minkseach in the guise of an escaped desperado the great grey shrike too is hardly a typical british paterfamilias but we are not disposed to quarrel on that score with the telling of his fascinating career which among other things reveals the origin of his curious name the  sentinel of special interest is the remarkable account of a fighting rabbit which became a terror even to the dreaded ferret a note by the author tells us that the facts as observed by himself have been independently confirmed by two of his correspondents the outcast tells the more or less familiar story of a rook who is a pariah among his fellows and his pathetic struggle against long odds we have no space even to hint at the startling experiences of the fox the otter the hedgehog the pomatorhine skua and the sparrowhawk mr st mars pauses now and again to emphasise certain features of animal existence that are not always appreciated he shows that the reason why the raiders habitually prey on animals so greatly their inferiors and avoid combat with their equals or superiors is in no way due to cowardice but simply that they see no fun in getting mangled without a cause the lot of a wounded creature being a pitiless one he points i i out too why a bird is so voracious it is simply  to balance the enormous expenditure of energy  it must gorge to fly and must fly to live the fullest enjoyment can perhaps be derived from this remarkable book by reading it once for the story at the authors pace which is anything but slow and then at leisure for a proper appreciation of the writing in this respect it will be worth more to the reader of mature judgement than to a juvenile but at the same time it can hardly fail to touch the enthusiasm of the young,folklore

  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust

tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he affects to adopt the opinions of duchinski about the great russian race he looks for the sources of his tales in any other direction at least two of the pieces given by miss hodgetts are russian bilini or legendary ballads the last of the russian warriors  and the celebrated chant of ilya muromets whose name is somewhat disguised in the form which it assumes in her book this ulina is interesting as giving us a glimpse how vladimir the first christian sovereign presented himself to the popular imagination in russia strange to say we find next to nothing about him in his religious character if we except his contest with the idolater ilya is the most popular hero of the old yolksepos vladimir is holding high court at sacred kiev  elie ilya galloped straight into the princes court jumped off his noble steed and tied bim up to an old oakpost this done he went to the sacred avieuomu bright p palace of the prince to pray and after having offered np thanks for his recovery he made a low bow to the prince and princess now the great prince vladimir was holding a feast there were princes and grand nobles present and many a valiant warrior when lie muromitch lija marorxtets had finished praying a mighty bowl large as a modern pail was handed to him foll of green wine elie ilya took the bowl and raisirg it to bis lips drank off the contents at one draught then up rose the great prince vladimir sud spoke for be and

readers of a passage in the frithof saga ej tvenne miin debt tomde some manner aro nu  not two strong men in these new days could drain that mighty cup lt will be observed that the wine is green the favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious stories we can only say that for

the myth of hiawatha and other oral legends mythologic and allegoric of the north ame rican indians by henry r schoolcraft lld philadelphia lippincott  co london triibner  co prof longfellow in the notes to hiawatha recognises the works of dr schoolcraft as the chief source from which his legends are taken the notoriety thus gained has moved this gentleman to reproduce with additions and in a revised form his algie researches which have been out of print for some years the peculiar opportunities which the author has enjoyed during a lengthened residence among the ojibways on an exploring expedition have not been lost he has collected a large number of the wild tales of the indians and he relates them with a simplicity which creates confidence in the accuracy of the translations made by the author and various friends named in the preface to the algie researches but not mentioned in the present work that there is a want of variety in the legends is not the fault of the author and that history and fiction are blended in them is assuredly not a circumstance peculiar to indian myths nor does it detract from their value their true interest beyond the quaint poetry which is occasionally to be traced in them is the insight which they give of indian character in them the man appears no pompous enunciator of commonplace truthsno cold abstraction of courage and enduranceas he has been represented by some novelists we see him with all his sagacity in small thingshis lack of extended vision and of the art and power of combinationhis suspicions ignorance and superstitions even hiawatha or manabozho in prose is a very different person from that hero in the poem those who have formed his acquaintance when decked in his poetical garb will be shocked to find that he is a notorious liar even among his compatriotsthat he invites his friends the birds and beasts to supper and firings their necks as they march by him at his request with their eyes shut  that he murders his hospitable friend the beaver in cold bloodand in short is hardly more respectable than his mythological brethren of greece old nohomis also in prose is said to have had a paramour in the shape of a beara strange form by the by for a lover however it might have fitly represented a married partner but while we recognise the value of these traditions as illustrations of the character of the indian they by no means possess the charm of the poetical versions during the perusal of some of them we felt to adopt the indian creed that the little servants of the great weeng the spirit of sleep were hammering at our temples in a manner that prevented our keeping our eyes open the indians admit however that these little spirits have no judgment which accounts for the sleep which occasionally overcomes them when floating above a fall or in other positions of danger and which may explain certain phenomena sometimes observed in our own churches while some are dull however others have a certain poetry of conception and strangeness of events that may amuse even after the rela j tion of the same or kindred tales by prof j longfellow but the most generally interesting portion of the book is that denominated  wild notes ofthe pibbigwun which contains some songs and small poems in the simple ideas of which though the metre and treatment are different much of the charm of the poem of hiawatha may be traced a very pretty allegory of niagara we extract an old grey man on a mountain lived he had daughters four and one and a tall bright lodge of the betula bark that glittered in the sun he lived on the very highest top for he was a hunter free where he could spy on the clearest day gleams of the distant sea 41 come out come out cried the youngest one  let us off to look at

sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in such a state as to

three of these irish legends the first is entitled the lrg end of bottlehill come listen to a tale of times of old come listen to me it was in the good days when the little people most impudently called fairies were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times that a farmer named mlick purcell rented a few acres of barren around in the neighbourlhood of the once celebrated preceptory of mourne situated about three miles from mallow and thirteen from  the beautiful city called cork mick had a wife and family they all did what they could and that was but little for the poor mans had no child grown up big enough to help him iii his work and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children and to milk the one cow and to boil the potatoes and carry the eggs to market to mallow but with all they could do twas hard enough on them to pay the rent well they did manacre it for a good while but at last came a bad year and the little grain of oats was all spoiled and the chickens died of the pip and the pi got the measlesshe was sold in m1allow and brought almost nothing and poor miick found that he hadnt enough to half pay his rent and two gales were due why then mlolly says lie  what 11 we do v  wisha then mavournene wlhat would you do but take the cow to the fair of cork and sell her says she and monday is fair day and so you must go tomorrow that the poor beast may be rested agaim the fair and what 11 we do when she s gone says mick sorrowfully  never a know i know lick but sure god wont leave us without him mick and you know bow good he was to us when poor little billy was sick and we had nothingr at all for him to take that good doctor gentlemen at ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk and how he gave us two shillinos and how he sent the things and the bottles for the child and gave me my breakfast when i went over to ask a question so he did and how lhe came to see billy and never left off his goodness till he was quite well  oh you are always that way molly and i believe you are right after all so i wont be sorry for selling the cow but ill go tomorrow and you must put a needle and thread  rough my coat tor you know  tis ripped wider the arn molly told himi he shouldl have every th1inhg righlit and about twelve oclock next dav he left her getting a charge not to sell his cowv except for the higlles penny mick promised to nliud it and went his way along the road he drove his cow slowly through the little stream which crosses it and rtins under the old walls of mlourne as he passel lie glanced hlis eves upon the towers and one of the old elder trees which were only then little bits of switches oh then if i only had half the money thats buried in you tisnt drivinx thlis poor cow 1 d he now why thenr isn t it too bad that it should be there covered over with earth and many a one besides me wvantingr it well if it s gods will i ll have some money myzself coming lack so sayigs he moved on after his beast twas a fine dav and the sunt shone brightly on the walls of the old abbey as hie passed under them  hie then crossed an extensive mountain tract and after six long min es lhe came to the top of that hillbottle luill tis called now but that was not the name of it thlen and jtust there a mnan overtook him g good morrow says he  good morrow kindly sas amick looking at the stranger who was a

your duty and you will see the end of it  and is this all  says mnick no more said the stranger  good bye mlick ipurcellyou are a rich man god grant it  said mlick as the old man moved after the cow and mlick retraced the road towards his cabin but lhe could not help turding back his head to look after the purchaser of his cow who was nowhere to lbe seen   lord between us and harm  said mick  he cant belong to this earth but swhere is the cow  she too was gone and iick went homeward muttering prayers and bolling fast the bottle and what would i do if it broke thought hie  oh  but i 11 take care of that  so he put it into his bosom and went on anxious to prove his bottle and loubting of the reception he should meet from his wife lbalancing his anxieties wvith his expectation his fears wviti his hopes he reached home in the evenina and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney oh mick are you come back sure you werent at cork all the way w that has happened to you where is the cow  did you sell her ihow much money did you get for her wx1hat news have you tell us every thing about it wwhy then molly if you ll give me time ill tell vou all about it if you

about it  but what bottle is that under your waistcoat  said molly spying its neck sticking out hy then be easy now cant you says mickf till i tell it to you  and putting the bottle on the table  that

mlick  cant you hearken to reason didnt i tell you how the old man or wh0jatsoever he  was nmet me no did not meet me neither hut he was thlere with meon the lig hill and how he tnmae me sell him the cow and told me the  hxotte was the only thing for me  yys indeed the only thing for you you fool i said molly seizing the biottle to url it at her poor husbands head but mlick eaught it a quietl for hie ininded the old i inwas adviice loosened lis wifes gsp aud i the bottle again in his bosom poor placed tle bottle arain in him bosom poor lolly sat down crying while mick told her his story with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm his wife could not hell believing him particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest who indeed never liscouraged her belief in the fairies may be he didnt know she believed in them and may be he believed them himself she got up however without saying one word and began to sweep thfe earthen floor with a bunch of heath then she tilied up every thing and put out the long table and spread the clean cloth for she had only one upon it anl alick placing the bottle on the ground looked at it and said bottle do your duty  l look thiere  look there marnmy  sail his chubby eldest son a loy about five years old look there  look there  and he sprung to his mothers side as two tiny3 little fellows rose like liglht froin the bottle and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver full of the finest victuals that ever were seen and when all wvas done wvent into the bottle again alick and his wife looked at every thingr with astonishment they had never seen such plates and dishles before and didnt think they could ever admire them enough the very sight almost took away their appetites but at length amolly said come and sit down mick and try and eat a bit sure you ought to be hungry after such a good days work w hy then the man told no lie about the bottle lick sat down after putting the children to the table and they made a hearty meal though they couldnt taste half thle dishes now says molly  i wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these file things again they waited but no one came so molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully saying  why then mick that was no lie sure enough  but you ll be a rich mhan yet ialick purcell  mick and his wife and children went to their bed not to sleep but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want and to take more land amick xvent to cork and sold his plate and bought a horse and cart and began to show that he was making money and tley did all they could to keep thle bottle a secret buat for all that their landlord found it out for hie came to alick one lay and asked him where he got all his mnoneysure it was not by the farm  and hie bothered him so much that at last amick told him of the biottle eis lanidlord offered him a deal of money for it but mliek would not give it till at last lhe offered to give hinm all his farm for ever so alick whco was very irich thought hed never want any more money and gave limn the bottle  but mlick was mistaken  he and his famnily spent money as if there  as no end of it and to make the story short they became poorer and poorer till at las tipev hlad nothing left but one cow and mick once more drove his cow before him to sell hier at cork fair hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle it was hardly daybreak when lie left   1 home and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill the mists were sleep ing in the valleys and curling like snoke wreaths upon the brown heath around hin the sun rose on his left and just at his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured forth its joyous matin song ascending into the clear blue sky  till its form like a speck in the airinesn blending and thrilling with music was nmelting in light m mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark 1ut thinking notwithstanding all the time of tile little old man when just as he reached tfie summit of the hill and cast his eves over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voice well mick purcell j toll you you would be a rich man  nieed then sure enough 1 was thats no lie for you sir good morning to you but it is not rich i an nowbut leave you another bottle for i want it nowv as much w i did long ago so if you have it sir here is the cow for it an ad here is tthe bottle said the old man smilinr  you know what to do witiit c s4 oh  then sure i do as good right i have well farewell for ever mlick purcell i told you you would be a rich man and good bye to you sir said mick as he turned back  and good luck to you and good luck to the big hillit wantsa namebottle hillgood bye sir good bye so mick walked back as fast as he could never looking after the whitefaced little gentlenman and the cow so anxious was he to brings home the bottlewell he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw molly oh  sure ife another bottle   arrah  then have you  why then you re a lucky man amick purcell thats whifat you are  in an instant she put ev ery thing right and alick looking at his bottle exult inglt cried out  bottle do your duty in a twinkling two great stout men with bio cudgels issued from the bottle i do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they event again mlick as soon as be recovered got up and looked about him he thomudht and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him lhe wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to mick v well what do you want now nothing sir only i heave another bottle 01 ho is it as good as the first yes sir and better if you like i will slhow it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen c come along then so saying mick was brought into the great hall where he sat bis old battle standing hi h uwn a shep ah ihail says he to himself if may be i woat have you by and by tic now says his landlord show us our bottle mick set it on the floor and 4nered the words in a moment the landlord nvas tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaringr and sprawling and kicking and 5hrieking wine  cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out  stop those two devils mick purcell or ill have you hanged   they never shall stop said amick till i get my own bottle that i see up there at top of that slhelf 4 give it down to him give it down to hnim before wve are all killed  says the landlord m mick put his bottle in his bosom in iumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried them home i need not lengthen mv story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upoil i it ay and so twill be always bottle luill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story the next legend we shall quote is entitled tihe field of boliauns torn fitzpatrick was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who lived at ballincollig tom was just turned of nineandtwentywhen he met the following adventure and was as clever clean tight goodlooking a boy as any in the whole county cork one fine day in harvestit was indeed ladyday in harvest that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the yeartom was taking a ramble through the ground and went sauntering along the sunny side of a lhedge thinking in himself where would be the great harin if people instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all were to shake out the hay and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge specially as the weather had been rather broken of late he all of a sudden heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge dear me said tom  but isnt it surprising to hear the storieclhatters sinainry so late in the season  so tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if hie was right in his guess the noise stopped but as tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hledge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee dinny dony bit of an old man with a little innffy of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head and a deeshy daushy leather apron hangingbefore him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a ittle piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and thern sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heelpiece on a bit of a broglue just fitting for himself well by the powers  said tom to himself  i often etad toll of the cluricaune and to tell gods truth i never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest if i go knowingly to work i in a made man they say a body must never take their eyes off them or they 11 escape  tom now stole on a little farther with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse or as we read in books the rattlesnake does withl the birds he wants to enchant so when he got up quite close to him  god bless your work neighbour said tom  the little man raised up his head and thank you kindly said he  i wonder youd be working on the holiday  said tom t hats my own business not yours was the reply w jrell may be you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there  said torn i  that i will with pleasure said lhe its good beer b eer  said tom  thunder and fire where did you get it  w where lid i oet it is it why i made it and what do you think i made it of  devil a one of me knows said toin but of malt i suppose what else  there you re out i made it of hcath of heath  said tom bursting out laughint sure you dont think me to be such a fool as to believe that  i io as you please said he  but what i tell you is the truth did you never hear tell of the danes   and that i did said tom  werent them the fellows we gave such a licking when they thouglht to take limerick from us  hen  said the little man drily is that all you know about the matter  well but about them danes said tom  why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in mny family ever since  twill you give a body a taste of your beer  said tom  ill tell you what it is young manit wouild be fitter for you to be lookiing after your fathiers property thaii to be botherino decent quiet people with your foolish questions there now while you re idling away your time here theres the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corni all about  tom was taken so by surprise with this that lhe wvas just on the very point of turnincr round when he recollected himself so afiraid that the like might happen again hie made a grab at the cluricaune and catught him up in his hand but in his hurry hie overset the pitcher and spilled all the beer so that hie could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was isle then swore what lhe would not do to him if he did not show him where his money wats tom looked so nwicked and so bloodyminded that the little man was quite frightened so says hli 1 conie along n itll j11c a 0o111 le of fields off and ill show vvu a tvtw k jf gold i i i i i so they went and tom held the cluricaune fast in his hand and never took his eves from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog for the cluricaune seemed out of pure mischief to pick out the hardest and most con trary way till at last they came to a geat field all full of boliaun buies ragweed and the cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun and says hie  dig under that bohiaun and youll get the vreat crock all full of guineas tom in his hurry had never minded three bringing a spade with him so he thought to run home and fetch one and that hie might know the place again he took off one of h red garters and tied it round the boliaun i suppose said the cluricaune very civilly youve no farther occasion for me no says tom you may go away now if you please and god speed you and may good lick attend you wherever you go well good bye to you tom fitzpatrick said the luricaune and much good may do you with what youll get 6so tom ran for the dear life till hle came home anid got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the tield of boliauns but when hie got there lo arnd behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very identical model of his own tied about it and as to diggi g up the wnhole field that was all nonsense for there was more than forty good irish acres in it so tom cane horn again with his spade on h is shoulder a little cooler than he went and inany s the hearty curse lhe grave the cluricaune every time he thoulght of the neat turn he had served him the last we shall quote isthe little sh0e now tell nie amolly said mlr coote to molly cogan as hle met her on the road one day close to one of t1se old gateways of kilmallock ldid you ever hear of the cluricauine is it the

king arthur and the knights of the round table by d o r i s ashley 6s od raphael tuck the fascination of the legends which centre in king arthur never fades but it is not always that younger readers can wrestle with the story in its customary form in this beautifully illustrated volume the language is simplified and to a certain extent modernised  a difficult task but carried out with good taste and a feeling for the period and the exquisite illustrations by mr arthur a dixon give a real amplification of the magical and mysterious atmosphere some of the fullpage colour plates are works of art on a very highplane particularly those depicting the encounters of the knights we assume that  linet should have been  ynette but arthurian critics may differ in any case the point is not an important one aid does not detract from the artistic value of this fine production,folklore

  thc prince of the fair family illustrated childrens books by mrs s c hall chapman  hall bright thoughts for the little ones with prose and verse by grandmamma cassell petter  galpin lightsome and the little golden lady by c h bennett griffith  farran washed ashore or the tower of stormont bay by w h g kingston jackson walford  hodder three hundred sfsops feibles translated by the rev g f townsend routledge  sons the princess i late a fairy talc saunders otley co mrs s c halls latest publication is a very pretty and rather whimsical story about little peoplewe can hardly call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of sounder work and better art are several wellexecuted landscapes from drawings by messrs e m wimperis and w s coleman mr w j allen is a very happy contributor of vignettes and tailpieces bright thoughts for the little ones is a book for infants the novelty of which consistsso far as we see the notion is a new onein the fact that little pieces of verse are made to alternate and proceed from little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him the event of the scorpion that attacked skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds grim hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend jack there is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told the illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  washed a shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved from its violence one of these is a dashing midshi pman who tells a young laxlya very young ladythat man friday was notablackwhatever defoe might have written there is also a very good blind pedlar a hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers especially as a considerable amount of local colouring is applied to descriptions of southern islands and the manners of their inhabitants the discovery of the longlost son of the old seacaptain who lived in the ancient tower and the narrative of that sons adventures make up jjr a sort of robinson crusoe stry that is well worthy the attention of the readers for whom the book is written three hundred esops fables purports to be a newliteral translation from the greek the work of th rev george fyler townsend who supplied new applications morals c to an edition of croxaus old version which we not long since reviewed croxaus production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation the illustrations which are thu work of mr harrison weir are very unequal in quality some are good as the fawn and his mother the crow and the  pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures the worst of i the book as a whole is that their author has not  the slightest sense of the eopian humour here i as in other respects no one of modern times has i approached the happiness of thomas bewick in his old age the princess ilsee is a fairystory of which the producer of the book before us be she translator or author hus no mean opinion it begius i with an account of the deluge and dryingup of  the earth and gives a rather fantastical description of the process of the latter by the hands of angels with huge besoms made of the wind and enormous brushes composed of sunbeams ono of these angels being rather tired with the  cleaning up sits down on the top of a lofty mountainalpine teak  our writer styles it and meditates on the terrestrial and moral prospect before him much in the manner of a serious and highlyrespectable  young lady in a drawingroom this angel is spoken of as male his notions are those of neither one sex nor the other  which is orthodox no doubt although the effect on the reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has our peculiar abhorrence tried by its own standard there is however ample evidence of care and even of delicacy in writing on the authors part she has carried out her intentions with exactness neatness

the high history of the holy grail trans lated from the french by sebastian evans 2 vols 44 temple classics dent  co tne 4 roman de perlesvaus to quote the title given by the colophon of the only fairly complete ms of the work is not without interest for students of the arthurian cycle although obviously a very late production it has retained a more archaic form of the grail quest than some romances which were almost certainly composed at much earlier date it knows nothing of galahad the character of gawain has not suffered from the process of degradation which affects many of the romances used by malory here and there incidents are preserved which may date back to as early a stage in the development of the legend as that represented by crestien or wolfram as for its other merits some of the mystic scenes e g arthurs visit to the chapel of st augustine are full of beauty and fervour there is occasional spirit in the dialogue and in the conduct of the story as when lancelot rights a damsel who complains of breach of promise of marriageoccasional nobility of sentiment as when lancelot proclaims to the hermit his love for the queen the writer has at times a keen eye for realistic detail a convincing way in setting forth a situation or an incident on the other hand he displays in more than common measure the usual faults of arthurian romance he has no architectonic gift he ludicrously misunderstands the gist and purport of the story he relates in place of an orderly sequence of coherent incidents he provides a jumble of inconsistent adventures like the author of the  queste del saint graal and like gerbert he is fond of interpreting in terms of mystic allegory the knightly feats he found in his sources and if his mode of interpretation is less frequently nauseous than that of the queste it is oven more preposterously silly compared with the  queste familiar to english readers as having passed almost entire into malorys  morto darthur  the present romance is for the general reader glaringly inferior the one has at least a dominant conception to which the separate incidents are subordinated with no little skill the other is a mere hotchpotch and on the whole a dull one dr evanss translation is a remarkable piece of work seldom has the style of malory been reproduced with happier grasp of its essential excellences here and there the translator indulges in needless archaisms going somewhat beyond his model but on the whole the effect is given not by slavish imitation but by sympathetic mastery of its power and charm the tone and movement of the original are rendered with equal skill and with close fidelity without being a supereminent specimen of its class the  roman de perlesvaus well exemplifies the charms and graces of the exquisite mediaeval french prose one of the most admirable mediums for continuous narrative that the skill of man has contrived dr evans does ample justice to its merits it is unfortunate that the translator should have seen well to add some critical comments upon the date and nature of his text which are calculated seriously to mislead readers of a popular series like the temple classics the more so as they may seem to receive endorsement from the few words affixed by the editor of the series mr gollancz dr evans is of opinion that the romance is the earliest in which the story of the grail is set forth such a paradox should either be seriously defended or not mentioned at all luckily it is hardly likely to lead astray even the most ignorant of readers the secondarynay tertiary or quaternary character of the work stares one in the face out of every page not an incident but presupposes a considerable existing literature darely one but betrays marks of deformation or curtailment or unintelligent vamping moreover dr evans is at some pains to prove the comparatively late date of the story which he assigns to the middle of the thirteenth century whence if one took his statement quite literally one must needs conclude he holds the poems which pass under the names of crestien and wolfram to have been written many years after the death of their alleged authors a minor paradox is the attempt to prove that the wellknown passage of helinand refers to f  the present romance and not to the socalled  grand st graal here again the facts of the case are so patent that no one who knows them can be deceived but the average reader does not know them and he ehould not have paradoxes which he cannot control sprung upon him without one word of their revolutionary character on the other hand the argument that helinands mention may be much later than the year 1204 to which it has hitherto been assigned deserves serious attention and is welcome to those who like the present revewer have found great difficulty in dating the  grand st graal as early as the opening years of the thirteenth century,folklore

the folklore of rome collecte by waord of i mouth fro the people by r h busi author of  patralias   sagas from the far east c london longmans  co 1874 miss blsk deserves great credit for the perseverance with which she has collected her extensive store of roman folktales and for the pains she has taken in grouping and marshalling them in almost every respect her present book is far superior to the other volumes of a similar nature which she has compiled and we may fairly look forward to receiving from her if she unflaggingly continues her studies such work as may be praised without reservation at present although her method bas decidedly improved there is still room in it for further improvement for instance a collector who takes down tales from the mouths of the common people ought if professing to work in the cause of science to give the names and address of every storyteller otherwise the world has no guarantee fbr the authenticity of the transcript this duty miss busk has entirely ignored and consequently we have no means of testing the accuracy of her impressions this is the more to be lamented inasmuch as these roman folktales are often told in language unlike that in which their sister stories are narrated elsewhere we may take as an example the passage in filagranata p 9 which depicts one of those wellknown scenes in which a prince having kissed a relative in spite of his wifes warning not to do so forgets that wife and prepares to take to himself another we have seen the kissing incident described a hundred times but never in such a style as this then all in the palace went to their sleepingchambers but the prince as it had been his wont from his childhood upwards went into his mothers room to kiss her after she wats asleep and when he saw her placid brow on the pillow with the soft white hair parted on either side of it and the eyes which were wont to gaze or him with so much love resting in sleep he could not forbear from pressinf his lips on her forehead and giving the wonted kiss as miss busk holds forth a promise of a second series let us hope that she will follow the good example set by mr campbell in his tales of the west highlands in which the name and address of the narrator of each story are conscientiously recorded as well as the date and place of its narration in that second series we would suggest also that as a general rule not more than one version of the same story shculd be given at length the repetition of all but identical incidents soon becomes wearisome on the other hand variants such as those which miss busk has given in small print are always valuable to comparers though they are apt to prove tedious to ordinary readers miss busk does not appear to be well acquainted with what has already been done in italy or is nfow being done to illustrate the folklore of its various provinces it seems that she  had heard it so often positively asserted that modern italy had no popular mythology and no contribution of special versions to offer to the worlds store of traditionary tales that she long refrained from attempting to discover any current italian folktales at last she took to hunting through the bookshops new and old to find any sort of collection of traditionary tales ready made but only with the effect of establishing the fact that no italian grimm had yet arisen to collect and organise them and put them into available shape it is true that she has heard of professor de gubernatis but she did not see his book on zooloyical iytlhology academt vol iv p 221 till after her ms was in the printers hands moreover she tells us the comparatively recent collection of sicilian tales by laura gonzenbach it was published in 1870 we may as well observe mentioned by irot ssor de 4ubernatis i did not know of and have not been able to see now to send information from london to a student of italian folklore residing in the capital of italy might seem to be equivalent to sending owls to athens or coals to newcastle it may be of use however to other explorers of the field to which miss busk has devoted herself if we give a few references to some of the books which have already appeared or are now in preparation upon the subject of the italian folktale as it happens two of the best edited collections of popular tales which we possess come from italythe volksmndirchen aus

by angelo de gubernatis in 1869 and the novelloja fiare a tin a and the norellaja milanese both edited by vittorio imbriani the former at naples in 1871 and the latter at bologna in 1872 in all parts of italy indeed at the present moment the tales current among the peasantry are being diligently collected and sedulously compared before long the italian folktale will be better represented than almost any other member of the widelyspread family to which it belongs it is of course unnecessary to say that there is very little that is absolutely novel in the rounan folktales the fiarole which occupy the first third of miss busks colleoc tion are variants of the old familiar  fairytales  to which we have so often listenedtales which if we are not mistaken have passed from the pens of professional eastern storytellers to the lips of the roman peasantry some of the details are curious thus in  the dark king a variant of the cupid and psyche story or that of  beauty and the beast combined with  blue beard the girl who opens the door of the forbidden chamber finds within it  a num ber of beautiful maidens weaving glittering raiment and  a goldsmith and all his men  making ornaments all of whom state that they are preparing the wedding apparel of the dark kings bride but beyond them is 4a little old hunchback sitting crosslegged and patching an old torn coat with a heap of other wornout clothes lying about him and he says he is mending the rags for the girl to go away in who was to have been the bride of the dark king and soon afterwards she has to retire in rags and disgrace after having driven a knife into the breast of her sleeping and unsuspecting lord in a variant of the story the deccan punchkin the russian koshchei the norse  giant who had no heart in his body the external object with which the demoniacal personages life is mysteriously connected is a stonewhich is lodged inside the head of a bird which lives inside the head of a leveret which resides inside the central head of a sevenheaded hydra when this stone is placed under the pillow of the demoniacal being who is represented as a wizard or magician he gives three terrible yells turning himself round and round three times and falls dead the incident has been interpolated in a version evidently derived from a literary source of the story of  aladdins lamp in a roman version apparently borrowed from modern greece of the strange myth of the king who insists upon marrying his daughter because her foot is exactly fitted by her dead mothers shoe the princess escapes from her father inside  a figure of an old woman just like life fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it just like a real woman in  the two hunchbacked brothers  we have an unsatisfactory version of a fairy story well known in coltic lands a hunchback is surrounded on a wide moor by a whole host of little hunchbacks who dance around him chanting plaintivelysaldbbto domouica many times at last he chimes in with the word  lunedi   whereupon both he and i they lose their humps his equally hunchbacked brother having tried the same ecepriment and having added the line  martei   to the song of  a tribe of hunchbacks which ransabbato domoenica lunedi   receives from them a drubbing and an added hump the story is unintelligible and unreasonable in its roman dress in the form in which it appears in the siddui kmir it is perfectly intelligible and certain premises being granted completely reasonable more   over the celtic tale is fraught with but a small amount of moral teaching while the italian tale can boast of none at all but their mongolian elder sister is absolutely replete with edifying doctrine after the favole in miss busks collection follow a number of  legendary tales ghost and treasure stories ciarpe c the ghost stories are disappointing and the jooular tales have unavoidably suf fered greatly in transit still there is much that is

literature  i basque legends basque legends collected chiefly in the i labourd by the rev wentworth webster with an essay on the basque language by m julien vinson london griffith  farran 1877 ligecldes et ricits populaisres due pays basque par m cerquand parts iii paris leon ribaut 18756 about the language and literature of the basques trustworthy information has never been overabundant but about their po pular tales scarcely any has until quite recently been vouchsafed we ought therefore to be grateful to mr webster and to al cerquand for the conscientious works on the subject now before us what they have made known will serve as a fair sample of the basque contribution to comparative  storiologry as al cerquand has given the basque texts as wvell as french translations his work wvill be the more valuable of the two to linguistic students but on our side of the channel mr websters is lihely to be far the more widely read there is very little in these basque stories which is specially characteristic except the names of the supernatural beings who figure in them it is quite impossible for even the most imaginative reader to construct out of them the faintest picture of basque life as distinguished from that led by ordinary spanish or french or even german or italian peasants nor can they serve to convey any idea of the peculiarities of basque thought or feeling their moral and physical views are utterly destitute of local colour nor do these stories differ in aught but their supernatural nomencla ture froin the tales current in almost all parts of europe among this nonaryan people just the same stories circulate as are familiar to the aryan europeans we find no new tales of any length nothing of importance wvhtich has not been repeated un numbered timnel by german scandinavian and slavonic lips as with the hungariain so is it with the basques speaking a tongue alien to the aryan family of speech thse tell stories wvhich have been described as

ilidtdindleztltv evolvel from comluolioi  gesrilis unless inideed the slp porters of the indeiendiet evolutioli hypi0 thesis are prepared to suppose that the stories of europe the basque and magyar specimens being included have been inde pendently evolved from mythological germs common to the human race before there was any difference between aryans and nonaryans the other explanation of the like ness between the basque and the rest of the european folktales seems at least simpler if spaniards and frenchmen borrowed their folktales of any length from the east of course the basques were likely to do the same there is not a single story of any length in the collections now before us for which either prof licbrecht or dr k61hler would be unable to quote close parallels from all parts of europe mr webster has been partly conscious of this and out of 218 pp 82 are devoted to  tales like the keltic and 33 more to  fairy stories derived directly from the french but if he had more often consulted what germans have written about popular tales lie would have seen that the tales of the west high lands and other similar stories from scotland ireland and brittany are not peculiar to kelts but are spread all over europe only once p 2 does he refer to a german book so we may infer that the special source of information on folktales has not been used by hiim and never does lie allude to any serious book on slavonic myih ology except m chodzkos now it is too much to expect that all comparative mythologists should be acquainted with slavonic tongues and it seems to be even too much to expect that they should be conscious of 1what has been done in the way of translations from the slavonic but unless a critic has studied what germany has taught his opinions on the mytlho logy of popular tales are apt to seenm less valuable to others than to hinmself he may be invaluable as a local collector or as an editor or translator of what others have gathered but he will act wisely if he keeps in reserve his ideas about the origin or the meaning of the stories he introduces to the world m cerquand observes a pleasing moderation in favouring us with his ideas about the solar myth but they obtrude them selves provokingly now and then thus in speaking i 34 of a being of the ogre or troll type who not unnaturally walks fast by dlay and sleeps by night in caverns lie

webster tell more quaintly of the marriage of the sun and dawn  the sun decking the morning clouds with his light and beauty and they again robing him in their soft and tender colouring  p xii in another place p 2 while speaking of the cyclops myth mr webster must needs suggest not only that the monsters single eve is that of the setting sun but that  the redhot stake is the ruddy mountain peak or the tall fir  trunk seen against the western horizon and illumined by his descending rays on the next page while speaking of those heroic fools who are not as he supposes them to be by any means peculiar to the basques lhe enquires can it be that the power which put out the suns fiery eye was looked upon as a beneficent being in a burning tropic land while as the legend travelled northward the act seemed more like that of madness or of senseless stupidity if anyone admires this sort of interpretation lhe will find at p 130 a specimen of it which covers more than a page a  suggested explanation  of an example of what may be called atmospherical or climatological myths but we will dwell no longer on what seems to us the one drawbiack to mr websters book we would not have alluded to it at all so grateful do we feel for what he has done aright were it not necessary to take every opportunity of warning collectors of local tales against attempting to explain them unless they have fitted themselves by special study for that arduous task much better is it to keep to facts than to venture on fancies all the trust worthy information which can be given about themythological drainatis personae of the basque tales will be gratefully received by specialists who can explain them more or less for themselves but who never before had any number of genuine basque tales to work upon we have already said that the stories or at least the longer ones have nothing new about them so far as their incidents are concerned but their supernatural agents are interesting

mechanically chews the four seeds which he finds in his hair while scratching his head to stimulate his wits whereupon the demon disappears thenceforth the man never left his house without having

cries  he has eaten something tell him that i will return but tell tell him i beg you to eat nothing in ordinary versions of the tale the hero is sent to sleep by a malicious magician but in the basque story the mere act of eating appears to pro duce upon him an effect not altogether unknown among ourselves another strange idea is that of the basques that no work ought to be done by nightout

popular tales from the norse by g webbe dasent dcl with an introductory essay on the origin and diffusion of popular tales edinburgh edmonston  douglas these quaint stories are translations from the

of an author the translator has gone upon the sound principle of omitting stories unfit for modern eyes but has wisely refused to soften blunt rude tales the value of which to the philologist and ethnologist consists in the faithfulness and truth of their rendering it was a severe rebuke to the pedant of a former age to find from grimm that latin and greek were not the foundations of all language that great scholar proved not only that teutonic laws were codes as valuable as those of justinian that though german minnesingers were not inferior to the occasional versewriters of though anthologia but also that our old norse mythology had been a source of poetry and fable as prolific as the old greek the discovery of the harmony existing between the language and creeds of the east and west began with the jesuits studies and thc researches of anquetil de perron at the end of the last century nursery tales became henceforward the study of the scholar so that the child laughed in the nursery over what was racking the scholar in his library it was as when the antiquary finds his child playing with a golden daric of a special rarity nursery stories were discovered to bo small

turks mongolians and samoyeds it is evident that though it may have happened to tell and that geslers cruelty may have been stimulated to inventiveness by the old legend the fable is of great antiquity and common to all archer nations it proves on the greek principle of the origin of myth that in certain ages stories have ft tendency to gravitate towardb a favourite national hero eventually to crystallise round his memory and become incorporated with hi fame it is the same with the loose wit of an age which comes down to the next generation as the jests of erskine or of sheridan half a wit says is forgotten half he is supposed to say is invented for him he is both better and worse than tradition allows one of the stories in dr dasents book called the master thief is we believe in the gesta bomanorum certainly in the sanscrit hitopadesa in herodotus and in german italian and flemish popular tales it is the same with the welsh story of gellert that the guide tells you as you stand wrapped in white clouds on the peak of snowdon the story is of the faithful dog who saved his master s child from a wolf and is slain by mistake as its supposed murderer this is a sanscrit and arabic storythe monks knew it pilpay records it and there is an old english version of it it is like  the dog of montargis which is told by plutarch and is an old french story also of the days of charlemagne sindbad and aladdin hassan and noureddin are of a common family with jack the giantkiller and puss in boots gentlemen all of unquestionable descent and whose genealogical tree is no mere walkingstick sapling iesop himself 13 not a bit superior to old pilpay nor is meagre phsedrus to be compared to the great german beastepic reynard the fox it is true that these wide analogies set us thinking but do not lead us very far on our way back to babel and eden we come however at last to the two great primaeval distinctions totheshemsand japhetsthe doers and thinkers the conquerors of europe and of india who now meet again after their long wanderings to quarrel once more for the empire of hindostan these two people of central asia were those of iran the tillers and those of iwran or the horsemenwanderersthe indoeuropean and the mongolian the author traces very ingeniously the corruption of the frost giants whose skulls thor had such a habit of splitting like walnuts to the meaner lubberly trolls whom jack always got the better of he shows us how in myths from the foes of the gods these giants became the largeheaded weaklegged dolts of our pantomimes and nursery stories as for odin he turned into the wild huntsman just as heathen wells became the founts of churcheschristianity putting its broad arrow on all the old pagan goods and chattels the monkish stories made the saints wander about and have adventures just as odin did who used to stroll into the forges of village smiths and get his heavenly horse newly shod frigga odins wife the goddess of industry and plenty is still worshipped under the name of the virgin of the fabulous golden agean old pagan tradition annexed and christened by the monksdr dasent tells us a very strange and epical legend that we cannot for the heart of us forbear copying the remembrance of the bountiful frodi echoed in the songs of german poets long after the story which made him so bountiful had been forgotten  but the norse skalds could tell not only the story of fredis wealth and bounty but also of his downfall and ruin in frodis house were two maidens of that old giant race fenja and menja these daughters of the giant he had bought as slaves and he made them grind his quern or handnull grotti out of which he used to grind peace and gold even in that golden age one sees there were slaves and frodi however bountiful to his thanes and people was a hard taskmaster to his giant handmaidens he kept them to the mill nor gave them longer rest than the cuckoos note lasted or they could sing a song but that quern was such that it ground anything that the grinder chose though until then it had ground nothing but gold and peace so the maidens ground and ground and one sang their piteous tale in a strain worthy of eschylus as the other restedthey prayed for rest and pity but frodi was deaf then they turned in giant mood and ground no longer peace and plenty but fire and war then the quern went fast and furious and that very night came mysing the searover and slew frodi and all his men and carried off the quern and so frodis peace ended the maidens the searover took with him and when he got on the high seas he bade them grind salt so they ground and at midnight they asked him if he had not salt enough but he bade them still grind on so they ground till the ship was full and sank mysing maids and mill and all and thats why the sea is salt perhaps of all the tales in this volume none could be selected as better proving the toughness of a traditional belief than no ii which tells why the sea is salt the norse had no idea of that devil whom the monks magiclanterned till he grew so large as to be all but omnipresent and omniscient as for hel she was the goddess who kept the nine keys of the place of death where all went who were unlucky enough not to die laughing on the field of battle waning for odin in some of these stories of our philologist the heathen clement and antiquity is singularly perceptible as in  the master smith where the hero thinks he has done a silly thing in quarrelling with the deviland in not a pin to choose between them where peter the husband of the silly goody goes about begging for alms from door to door in paradise the transformations of men into beasts are numerousas in the greek and roman stories which perhaps are of scythian origin the werewolf or manwolf is a frequent character in the old legends but the favourite beast for norse transformation is the bearwhose strength and sagacity made him an object of wonder and respect with the sturdy woodmen of norway who even now think the finns and lapps can assume the shape of animals the lapps disowning this magical power still call the bear grandfather look on him with awe beg his pardon as they cut his throat bring him back to their tent with apologetic ceremonies declaring that  grandfather whom they have killed had the strength of ten men and the wit of twelve greylegs wolf is a kindlygrateful beast in the old storiesand the horses save their masters out of peril and bear them to fortune the dog makes no great figurebut the goat occasionally being sacred to thor appears in force and with supernatural attributes the trolls seem to have been more pucklike and malignant than the giants they were weaker and therefore more malicious they seem to have devoted their lives to injure man and mans works sometimes they are represented as thieves and cannibals they dwell in the spins of the fells in the dried pineforest in dens to which they carry off the children of men helpless lads and beautiful maidens they guard the riches and sit in clefts of the rocks surrounded by threadneedle streets full of gold and silver they haunt the dark forest by day and feast by night to see the sun was fatal to themif once it looked them full in the face they burst in sheer spite fear horror and disgust about all these storiescrystalsided and sparkling with fancies rare and fantastic as the shapes that icicles assume  there is a bluff honesty refreshing as the rough wind that chills one minute and the next sends the warm blood in a red gush to the buffeted cheek hindu stories are tropically overlaid with imagery the arabs are keen and bright as their sabres and damascened with tropes and episodes the german are simple hearty and full of kindly humour the swedish are stiffer and more matteroffact but the norse are full of birdmusic and have a fragrance about them of wild flowers and the aromatic pineforest the men they paint are norsedaring fellows who die making the best of it fighting with the last inch of sword and after thattill the hand is lopped off they speak bluntly but never pervert morality or deny the true principles of right and wrong they delight to sketch the neglected and snubbed genius the younger brother who is what the norse call the coalbiter who broods over the firethinking but doing nothingwho is the drudge and fag of the familywho basks in the quiet selfconsciousness of hidden strength and who at last uprises like david to slay the philistine or rather to tame the magic horse ride up the slippery glass hill and win the princess though good the brave and the true are always praised this shows the just moral standard of though norse writer as for the women they are not very strongly drawn  but then they are generally bright good tender and helpfulforgetting themselves in their eagerness to help others as dr dasent says of the heroine justly   when she goes down thc well after the unequal match against her stepsister in spinning bristles against bax she steps tenderly over the hedge milks the cow shears the sheep reueves the boughs of the appletreeall out of the natural goodness of her heart when she is sent to fetch water from the well she washes and brushes and even kisses the loathsome head she bebeves what her enemies say even to her own wrong and injury she sacrifices all that she holds most dear and at last even herself because she is made to believe that it is her brothers wish and so on her too the good powers smile she can understand and profit by what the little birds say she knows how to choose the right casket and at last after many trials all at once the scene changes and she receives a glorious reward while the wicked stepmother and her ugly daughter meet with a just fate nor is another female character less tenderly drawn in bacon grizzlebeard no v where we bee the proud haughty princess subdued and tamed by natural affection into a faithful loving wife we sympathise with her more than with the patient grizzel of the poets who is in reality too good for her story has no relief while in bacon grizzlebeard we begin by being angry at the princesss pride we are glad at the retribution which overtakes her but we are gradually melted at her sufferings and hardships when she gives up all for the beggar and follows him we burst into tears with her when she exclaims  oh the beggar and the babe and the cabin and we rejoice with her when the prince says  here is the beggar and there is the babe and so let the cabin burn away there is something in very truth inimitable about these storiesas for instance the yankee vein of lying in the boots who made the princess say  thats a storywhich is a narrative of a witty younger son who is promised the hand of an exaggerating princess if he can make her express her wonder at his yarns about others as the gutnt who had no heart in his body there is an inexhaustible vein of imagination which even the  arabian nights though fuller of colour cannot rival in this as in so many of the norse stories there is a younger son who from natural kindness of heart on his way to other adventures helps neglected animals who in their turn aid him in moments of emergencya kindly moral not unuseful in its way he feeds a halfstarved raven slopes a salmon stranded on a shallow into deeper waterand gives his old horse to feed a wolf who in gratitude leads him to the giants house at this cannibals house he finds a princess who promises to aid him in killing the giant her masterbut the difficulty is that he does not carry his heart life about with him and keeps it a secret where it is hidden the faithful couple look everywhere for the giants heartunder the doorsill in the cupboardeverywhere but in vain like samson he will not betray his secret to dalilah till after much treacherous wheedling and pressing at last the very foolish monster confesses that far away in a lake lies an island on that island stands a church in that church is a well in that well swims a duck in that duck there is an egg and in that egg his heart like the house that jack built these stories run round this sort of wheel and back again off goes boots the coalbiter the wolf carries him to the island the raven flies to the tower for the churchkeys the salmon fetches the egg from the well where the guardianduck had dropped it he squeezes it the giant screams and begs for mercy 500 miles off boots treacherously makes him under a tacit promise turn six brothers of his back from stone to fleshthen breaks the egg and the giant dies of course the story ends with a wedding and with the usual quip which has drawn down thousands of peals of laughter if they have not done feasting why they are still at it  popular tabs

the children are likely to give this book a very hearty welcome it consists of a series of the most delightful fairy tales from norway that land where the supernatural still lingers some of course are very old friends and have been read in the pages of hans anderssen grimm and ferrault but even they have a flavour of the north as if the author had gathered the variants from the lips of his neighbours and the translator deserves congratulation on the success with which his work is done he does not always attain the same level but more than once his rendering is divinely felicitous we might take  the lad with the beer keg  as an example and but for its length would quote it in justification of praise that may seem extravagant the subject itself is a singular mixture of the gruesome the humorous and the fantastical but the story is related as all fairy tales should be in the matteroffact unconcerned supremely natural style that pays no heed to the auditors reflection any more than to the credibility of the story god the devil and death come after the beer in the intimate and familiar yet not irreverent manner in which we can imagine they used to figure in an easter play or a christmas mumming and the racy colloquialism is maintained without recourse to slang or its equivalent the english is very pure as well as being simple and familiar we have alluded only to one story but dozens might be quoted in many the usages of modern life are introduced into the stories in a manner that seems to show that the norwegians believe as sincerely in trolls and fairies as ever they did nor would it be fair to omit from mention the very clever illustrations they are the original pictures made by three norwegian artistse werenskiold t kittelsen and 0 sinding it might perhaps be objected that they are too clever and original for children but the book is likely to be often referred to and a picture is none the worse for being able to bear a third or a fourth scrutiny nor does it after all demand a very mature judgement to recognise the character that beams from the three troll faces on p 15 or the brightness and humour in nearly every cut the book deserves the very highest

chinese folklou tae by rev j macgowan macmillan 3s net in these days we demand very rightly that the follcqists shall do their best to give us verbatim reports and not vague adaptations of the stories they gather mr macgowans folklore is coloured in too high a degree by the memory in which it has been stored and by the authors consciousness that he is addressing a western audience regarded as stories for the general reader the tales are both entertaining and highly moral but if the author had had more artistic sense he would never have sacrificed so much of the oriental atmosphere to a conventional english way of storytelling  chiice folklore tailecs by the rev j macgowan dd i macmillan and co 3s net this interesting book of folkstories conveys a good idea of theto western ideas topsyturviness  of china that country where the roses have no fragrance and the women no petticoats where the needle points to the south and where to wear white is to put yourself into mourning human beings are protected and aided by fairies sent by the rulers of the western heavens and tormented by a world of bad spirits or demons so that as dr macgowan says the minds of the people are filled with romance and poetry relieving in mysterious ways the dull greyness of their lives a very marked feature of these tales is the profound respect shown by everyone for the ideal standard of conduct or divine righteousness tienli  it is the standard by which kings and princes and common people direct their conduct whether in the highest affairs of state or the ordinary engagements of everyday life and these tales are concerned chiefly with the rewards of those who have practised and the punishment of those who have failed in this respect,folklore
sagas fkom the fab east sagas from the far east or kalmouk and mongolian traditionary tales by the author ofpatranas c griffith and farran  the word  saga applied to eastern fables and legends may prove a cause of offence to some hypercritical readers but if not strictly accurate its employment in the present instance is highly suggestive the dreamy pathetic spirit of oriental storyland is thus shown in contrast with the rough and vigorous genius of the north and without establishing invidious comparisons or hinting disparagement of the prowess of viking or berserker we cannot but feel that the tender reverence for life and the pervading pity which throbs through the humour and pathos of the east beam out in sweeter brighter relief like a star against a stormy sky scenes of reckless valour and slaughter of broadbreasted chieftains wrestling naked cleaving each others skulls with mighty axestrokes robbing quarrelling wreaking vengeancethe whole shown in a flow of heroic sunlight may well fascinate those who can find nothing in their own day to call forth strength or struggle but the man to whom participation in the woes and trials of a living world makes it difficult to regard pain and bloodshed from the ideal standpoint and who accordingly will find more to repulse than delight him in the glad and ruthless temper of scandinavian lore may welcome the music of the gentler bishi as a wholly soothing power let him consent to the influence and it will lure him forth into a wild fantastic country illumined by the tender radiance of a starlit night where under flowery trees and amid rich scents and sights a hundred quaint innocent beings will exchange confidences with him whilst around them the scene shifts and changes like firepictures or landscapes wrought of cloud nor is there in this fanciful extravagance anything grotesque or discordant it is the parable of the oneness of life of the brotherhood of all nature repeated in evervarying toneslistening to which from time to time has benefits for the heart and imagination beyond the lifting of cares and responsibilities though no stronger charm could be devised to make these indeed  fold their tents like arabs and as silently steal away the present tales chiefly mongolian but of indian origin have lost somewhat of their exuberance of colour in the process of transplantation to a less ardent soil by the help of german translators and chiefly of professor julg the author of  patranas desires we are informed in the preface to give these stories an english form as readable and at the same time as literal as circumstances will allow on the latter score some too palpable slips and flaws have handed over our hapless author to the tender mercies of outraged dryasdusts but notwithstanding such enormities as putting a hegoat where a ram should be and mistaking a lark for a swallow we would suggest that these heinous sins against the letter may to some extent be compensated by the delicate appreciation of the spirit of the original and that to have maintained the quaint simplicity humour and gentleness which characterise oriental thought is after all more valuable than a closely accurate translation lacking as by the way such productions almost invariably do these essential attributes beaders acquainted with captain burtons charming version  vikram and the vampire  will find the plan of the story of  the wellandwisewalking khan familiar and no doubt both legends have one and the same origin but besides that they serve as introductions to a distinctly different series of narratives there are some conspicuous dissimilarities in the kalmuck rendering of the tale like vikram the wellandwisewalking khan is charged to bring a peculiarly animated and ingenious bogy from one spot to another without exchanging a word with him by the way in both instances the crafty prisoner offers to enliven the journey by telling stories and thus the captors irresistible love of moralising is repeatedly made to betray him into expressing either indignation or approval when of course his charge escapes him and he has to recommence his journeyings but in the present case the siddhikur is a vastly more desirable acquisition than vikrams vampire   from his waist upwards he is of gold from his waist downwards of emerald his head is of motherofpearl decked with a shining crown also the incidents which cause this task to be imposed upon the khans son are different pursued by seven magicians he has taken refuge in the cavern of the holy master and teacher nagarguna and by an ingenious device manages to destroy his enemies upon which the master reproves him for having taken seven lives to save one the wellandwisewalking khan excusing himself on the plea that this one life being his own was naturally exceptionally precious to him notwithstanding professes himself willing to discharge any penitential labour nagarguna may deem fitting accordingly he is sent to fetch the siddhikiir on his road rise up before him the dim shapes of the giant dead the pigmy dead the child dead all of whom he quiets by magic passwords finally he discovers the siddhikur as he has been warned in a cool grove and the creature catching sight of him scampers off and clambers up a mangotree then as directed the khan threatens to cut down the tree  but the siddhikir has an extraordinary fondness for his mango fell not the mangotree rather will i come down to thee which he accordingly does and is tied up in the khans sack and shouldered until such time as his companions irrepressible sententiousness gives him a chance of escape when with diabolic glee he exclaims  forgetting his health the wellandwisewalking khan hath opened his lips and with the cry  to escape out of this world is good he speeds him through the air swift out of sight among the stories by which this crafty imp manages to beguile the way are many which possess interest for the comparative mythologist as for instance in how the widow saved her sons life where we have king midas and his asss ears with scarcely any alteration and again in the story of  the white bird and his wife which is virtually the myth of  psyche and eros the same idea reappearing in the tale of the goldspitting prince of the second collection of legends entitled by our author the saga of ardschibordschi and vikramaditjas throne the vikramaditjas more properly vihramadityas alluded to is the same vikram of the hindi legend he being a personage of as great importance in indian traditions as king arthur in our own and having as many and as marvellous feats ascribed to him as a fair specimen of these stories and of the present writers treatment of them we may cite the beautiful fable of who invented woman  the wonderful deeds of vikramaditjas are being related to ardschibordsehi so as to make him diffident of mounting the throne of one so illustrious ifc is told him how the magnanimous king amongst other triumphs once succeeded in arousing a certain beautiful princess narandakini from the silent contemplation in which she appeared hopelessly sunk vikramaditjas goes to visit the silent haughty one in her lonely cavern taking with him four ministers whom he transforms respectively into the altar the lamp the vessel for burning incense and the rosary he holds in his nandi then according to the usual plan he proceeds to tell narandakini a story long ages ago there went forth daily into one place four youths to mind their flocks and when their flocks left them leisure they amused themselves with pastimes together now it came to pass that one day one of them rising earlier than the rest and finding himself at the place alone said within himself  how is the time weary being here all alone  and he took wood and sculptured it with loving care until he had fashioned a form like to his own and yet not alike and when he saw how brave a form he had fashioned he cared no more to sport with the other shepherd lads but went his way and the next morning the second of the youths rose earlier than the rest and said  how is the time weary being here all alone  and he found the form the first youth had fashioned and finding it exceeding brave he painted it over with the five colours and when he saw how fair a form he had painted he cared no more to sport with the other shepherd youths but went his way and the next morning the third of the youths came to the place and said  how is the time weary being here all alone  and he cast about him for some pastime  thus he discovered the form which the first youth had fashioned and the second had painted and he said  this figure is beautiful in form and colour but it has no understanding so he infused into it wit and understanding and when he saw how clever was the form he had endowed with wit and understanding he cared no more to sport with the shepherd lads but went his way the fourth morning the fourth youth finding himself all alone said  how is the time weary being here all alone and casting about for some pastime he discovered the fair form which the first youth had fashioned and the second painted and the third youth had made so clever and he said  behold the figure is beautiful in form and colour and admirable for wit and understanding but what skills all this when it has not life   and he put his lips to the lips of the figure and breathed softly into them  and behold it had a soul that could be loved and was woman  but when the other youths saw that they came back all the three and demanded possession of her by right of invention and when they found that none prevailed against the rest they brought the matter before the king to decide say now o narandakini in favour of which of these four was the king bound to decide that he had invented woman   and as the king left off from speaking he looked towards narandakini but the silent haughty one sat immersed kin deep contemplation speaking never a word but the altar the lamp and the vessel for incense forthwith taking upon themselves to reply and of course one and all making a wrong selection swiftly exasperate narandakini into setting them right with a sound rating to boot on the ground that  unsouled objects such as they should presume thus to pronounce upon the question lt is to be regretted that the author of patranas  should have burdened the present graceful and poetic work with elaborate notes for the most part wholly irrelevant and whilst containing no fresh information for students of oriental literature calculated rather to mislead than instruct those entirely unacquainted with the subject the root of the mischief lies in injudicious zeal for christianity and jealousy for the priority of its claims in the doctrines of the incarnation and the trinity thus at the close of a lengthy account of takyamunis career we are informed that  an unenlightened admiration for the story of our divine redeemers life on earth may be supposed to have induced the ascribing of his supernatural manifestations to another being already accepted as divine  which is an ingenious method of escaping the difficulty but unfortunately it does not explain away the records of identical beliefs having prevailed at a period when christian influence was impossible for example so wellknown a work as fergussons  tree and serpent worship might have informed our author vide plate 33 that the incarnation of buddha is clearly depicted on the northern gateway of the sanchi tope the date of the erection of this gateway being ad 20 ie before the passion of christ and hence infallibly before the spread of his doctrine it is indeed admitted that certain appearances of vishnu and siva upon earth are alluded to as early as 300 bc but it is added the dogma is not fully developed  the heroes of the early epic poems still maintain their individualities they are actuated and indwelt by vishnu but they are not him this it will be seen is very different from the christian dogma of the incarnation we confess we do not see it one last position anl one only still remains possible for adherents to the old faith in the face of the researches of the philologist and comparative mythologistlet them renounce as silently as may be the theory of a special covenant with a privileged race to hold fast by mr gladstones convenient doctrine of a primaeval tradition common to all people here in this their last stronghold let them await the hour when the synthesis of the religious idea completed the temple of the supernatural must fall to give place to the more majestic edifice founded not upon sand but on the rock of natural and mental laws against which waves may wash and winds beat and tempests storm in vam fe  1 saras from thc far east or kalmouk and j mongolian traditionary tales with his torical preface and explanatory notes by the author of patraiias griffith tfc farran the first sight of this book afforded us an agreeable surprise neither in the collection of spanish stories entitled  patraiias nor in that of tyrlese tales labelled as from  the land of hofer were there many traces of anything like scholarly work but the volume now before us although purporting to be by the author of those compilations is so far as part of it is concerned immeasurably superior to them for it contains in its notes a considerable amount of solid information industriously collected from a very wide field of research they are gathered not only from the wellknown works of the chief authorities on oriental subjects but also from the transactions of learned societies and other scientific periodicals familiarity with which is rare except among professed scholars to some of them prof j digs name is appended but the author of  patraiias appears to claim the rest as his own to our eye however they seem to be decidedly of german rather than of english extraction take for instance the following note on page 401  the wolfnurtured prince hag a prominent place in mongolian chronicles their dynasty was founded by

spite of its grammatical obscurity we felt convinced that this note came from a german workshop and at page 128 of julgs  mongolische miirchen we found it minus the obscurity  es spielt aben der wolf auch in den stammsagen der mongolen eine bedeutungsvolle rolle indem sie ihre furstenreihe beginnen mit biirte tschinoa c in this instance jiilgs name has undoubtedly been omitted through inadvertence for our author has usually recognised all obligations to him some of the notes however are evidently of home manufacturethe following for example  as an instance of the migration of myths i may mention here that i met in spain with a ballad which i am torry i have mislaid and cannot therefore quote the verse in which the lovelorn swain in singiag the praises of hui mistress among other charms enumerates that the flowers spring from the stones as she treads her way through the streets stephanos  delicate monster  did not speak in more contrasted tones than make themselves heard in these two notes thus much for the commentary the text itself containing the  kalmouk and mongolian traditionary tales of the siddhi aur and the  history of ardshi bordshi khan appears to have been translated from the german versions of those works  of these versions i have availed myself says the translator in a preface which is not as clear as it might be with respect to the authorities on which the present work is based the stories now  for the first time put into english have as is well known been transferred from india to central asia from the  twentyfive tales of a vetala and the  adventures of vikrama and other like sources to the abovenamed calmuck and mongolian collections on their way they have naturally undergone some transformations but these only render them the more interesting to students of comparative mythology they have already been rendered familiar by prof jiilgs handy and in every way excelleut translation as well as by other versions notably the russian paraphrase made by au erudite lama but to the general reader they will offer all the charm of novelty among thc most interesting of these tales is a version of the story found in so many lands of though husband who sometimes appears in the form of a man and sometimes in that of one of the lower animals until at last his wife destroys the magic skin or slough on which his transformation depends its most familiar forms are probably those of  the little ass grimm km no 144 and east o the sun and west o the moon dasent no 4 the well known  frogprinco grimm no 1 also belongs to the same group but it has lost its most important incident in the first story it is an asa that the heroine marries in the second a bear in the third a frog in the calmuck story no 7 it is a bird two sisters successively wander in search of a lost ox and each of them enters a palace in which is a great white bird perched upon a golden throne to each sister the bird fruitlessly proffers marriage but their younger sister when she in her turn enters the palace accepts the bird and is married to it this bird is an enchanted man who sometimes assumes his human shape during his absence one day his wife acting on the advice of an old woman burns his cage according to julgs version his featherdress or birdlike husk according to gomboief s when he returns home and finds out what she has done he tells her that what she has burnt was his  soul and that now he will probably be carried off by demons his only chance of escape depends upon her being able to continue waving a stick which he gives her for seven whole days and nights during which time he will be engaged in contest with his ghostly enemies she does her best but on the seventh night in spite of her having propped up her eyelids with feathergrass she closes her eyes for a moment and her husband is carried off by the evil spirits the calmuck psyche wanders disconsolate in search of her lost cupid and at last finds him sitting at the foot of a hill he tells her that the demons have made him their watercarrier and he begs her to go home and make another cage and woo back his soul into it then he is swept away by the demons but she returns home and does what he has requested and suddenly from behind the wall a bird flew in and that bird was her husband such is an outline of this calmuck paraphrase of an indian tale according to prof di gubernatis the bird is the sun and  the aurora or dawn is the aviary made of flames of this divine bird when the aviary is burned at morn the aurora and the sun separate they meet again in the evening when the aviary is reconstructed by way of another specimen of these sagas we will take the mongolian story no 14 it is a variant of the wellknown tale of the goodnatured hunchback from whom his hump is taken off by the grateful fairies whose song he improves and of his illnatured companion in deformity on whom the enraged fairies confer an additional hump in punishment for his not having sufficiently amplified their song or having spoilt it by an unwelcome addition a special favourite with the celtic peoples it is also familiar to the japanese to whom it probably came through buddhistic channels similar to those which conveyed it to the tibetian mongols the story in the siddhi kiir relates how a poor man whom a rich brother has not invited to a feast rushes out into the forest with the intention of killing himself but as he goes along he sees a number of the spirits called dakinis disporting themselves and perceives that they have a wondrous bag from which when it is struck by an equally miraculous hammer all things desirable flow abundantly so when they have departed he steals the bag and hammer and returns home reconciled to existence his rich brother hearing of his sudden prosperity calls on him extracts his secret by means of unbrotherly threats and starts at once in search of the haunt of the dakinis arriving there he is seized by those spirits who take him for the thief who has stolen their sack and hammer at first they talk of killing him but at last they determine to stretch his nose to an immoderate length and tie nine knots in it when this has been done they disappear and their victim slinks sadly home after a time he hears that his brothers magic hammer can loose the knots so he sends for him and agrees to reward him richly if he will perform the cure when the hammer is applied to the sufferers nose knot after knot vanishes but when only one remains the patients wife dismisses the operator hoping thereby to avoid having to pay the stipulated reward then she steals the magic hammer and tries to cure the last knot herself but not knowing how to use the miraculous weapon she hits her husband so violent a blow with it that his head cracks asunder and his brains run out whereupon he dies and his brother inherits his wealth from these two samples an idea may easily be formed of the worth and interest of the collection as regards the merits of the translation it is difficult to know what to say we have stated that we were agreeably surprised by the first sight of the volume now before us it opened at the notes and we were delighted at finding in them traces of exact and apparently conscientious labour but when we read the translations of the tales we became not a little bewildered if these stories were intended for children and unlearned persons only why were such elaborate notes appended to them if they were meant for students also why were they not translated as closely as propriety would permit 1 the translator says that he has  made it an undeviating rule to let such alterations as occur be as few and as slight as the case admitted but he seems to have broken his rule on numerous occasions if we turn for instance to the story of the  two brogers of which we have given a summary we find that the english version differs considerably from that given by prof jiilg in his  mongolische marchen when the avaricious brother falls into the hands of the spirits and one of them suggests that he be put to death we are told that  the dakinis were thoroughly out of temper and did not want any urging the words were no sooner uttered than like a flock of birds they all flew round him and seized him  how shall we kill him asked one as she held him tight by the hair of his head till every single hair seemed as if forced out by the roots  fly with him up to the top of the rock and then dash him down  cried some  drop him in the middle of the bea cried others  cut him in pieces and give him to the dogs cried others again the whole of this passage appears to be an expansion of the simple words which prof jiilg has rendered as follows so verabredeten sie unter einander in ihrer erbitterung of course in a mere christmas storybook such expansions would be venial but the learned notes which adorn the present volume give it a claim to be considered as belonging to a different department of

work he wrote a little handful of stories that deserve immortality but as can be seen here out of the slightest of motiveshecould make something at least pretty his talent his art never forsook him even when his genius was not alight dr sommers translation is exceedingly good it is so very simple that you may not see at first its real skill but read a few of the stories through and its charm steals over you it is simple not in the sense that it condescends to children but with the simplicity of good literature the translators work should receive recognition we hope it may and that mr gaskin for all his merits may not run away with all the praise a good many of mr gaskins drawings for the book will have been seen at the arts and crafts exhibition where they had an honoured place and no wonder the school of draughtmanship to which outwardly he belongs has prodiiced a great deal of work beautiful regarded as mere decorati n but which set to illustrate tales of real moving human life is unsatisfactoryit delights the eye but it is not what illustrations should be a commentary on an illumination of the text this cannot be said of the pictures here while altogether removed from commonplace realism they are yet instinct with life with feeling with humour the tenderness in the loveliest rose of the world in the bond of friendship in  ib and christine and in the wild swans is quite as remarkable as the beautiful detail the decorative qualities in  the marsh kings daughter  the daisy  the goloshes of fortune and  a leaf from heaven to name only a few many words are not needed to express hearty appreciation the whole hundred of them are pictures not merely to admire but to linger over with keen delight the volumes are good specimens of printing indeed mr gaskin is

hopeless to make a fuss about the fairies the fuss aesthetic the fuss of folklore the fuss moralizing the fuss gruesome all of these are ruin for a fairy tale for children the best authors have been guilty at times there are moments when even andersen makes the reader sit up with an indignant  that didnt happen and then with a delicate pop away goes the fairy tale and ones happy credulity the best stories are the old stories told quite simply  they may be in language a little conventional as was the language of mrs freers  old deccan days  and some of the older versions of the  arabian

are there brighter there is more gold in the sun and more silver in the moon of that land there is more scent on the flowers more savour in the fruit there is more comeliness in the men and more

popular tales from the norse by g webbe dasent dcl with an introductory essay on the origin and diffusion of popular tales edinburgh edmonston  douglas these quaint stories are translations from the norske folkeerentyr collected by mm asbjbrnsen and moe and have been the preface says the occasional work of dr dasent for fifteen years which is more than the period of patience that horace required of an author the translator has gone upon the sound principle of omitting stories unfit for modern eyes but has wisely refused to soften blunt rude tales the value of which to the philologist and ethnologist consists in the faithfulness and truth of their rendering it was a severe rebuke to the pedant of a former age to find from grimm that latin and greek were not the foundations of all language that great scholar proved not only that teutonic laws were codes as valuable as those of justinian that though german minnesingers were not inferior to the occasional versewriters of though anthologia but also that our old norse mythology had been a source of poetry and fable as prolific as the old greek the discovery of the harmony existing between the language and creeds of the east and west began with the jesuits studies and thc researches of anquetil de perron at the end of the last century nursery tales became henceforward the study of the scholar so that the child laughed in the nursery over what was racking the scholar in his library it was as when the antiquary finds his child playing with a golden daric of a special rarity nursery stories were discovered to bo small pompeiis of ancient manners fossiled strata of bygone arabian icelandic or persian antiquities they led us back to wonderful theories of the alliances and conquests and descent of the nations who wrote them languagedoctors learned to take uri these fables point to their roots and explain to us as with vegetables the manner and time of their growth many of the stories were found existing in five or six different nations and in different ages and different degrees of civilizationwilliam tell for instance and his daring shot it is told in saxo grammaticus in the twelfth century of king harold gormsons thane in the willana saga of wayland smiths younger brother in the saga of king olof of eindredi the heathen chief it is told again of king harold sigurdarson who died 1066 in the fourteenth century the malleus maleficorum refers it to puncher a magician of the upper rhine in england william of cloudsle in the old north country ballad performs the same featit is common to the turks mongolians and samoyeds it is evident that though it may have happened to tell and that geslers cruelty may have been stimulated to inventiveness by the old legend the fable is of great antiquity and common to all archer nations it proves on the greek principle of the origin of myth that in certain ages stories have ft tendency to gravitate towardb a favourite national hero eventually to crystallise round his memory and become incorporated with hi fame it is the same with the loose wit of an age which comes down to the next generation as the jests of erskine or of sheridan half a wit says is forgotten half he is supposed to say is invented for him he is both better and worse than tradition allows one of the stories in dr dasents book called the master thief is we believe in the gesta bomanorum certainly in the sanscrit hitopadesa in herodotus and in german italian and flemish popular tales it is the same with the welsh story of gellert that the guide tells you as you stand wrapped in white clouds on the peak of snowdon the story is of the faithful dog who saved his master s child from a wolf and is slain by mistake as its supposed murderer this is a sanscrit and arabic storythe monks knew it pilpay records it and there is an old english version of it it is like  the dog of montargis which is told by plutarch and is an old french story also of the days of charlemagne sindbad and aladdin hassan and noureddin are of a common family with jack the giantkiller and puss in boots gentlemen all of unquestionable descent and whose genealogical tree is no mere walkingstick sapling iesop himself 13 not a bit superior to old pilpay nor is meagre phsedrus to be compared to the great german beastepic reynard the fox it is true that these wide analogies set us thinking but do not lead us very far on our way back to babel and eden we come however at last to the two great primaeval distinctions totheshemsand japhetsthe doers and thinkers the conquerors of europe and of india who now meet again after their long wanderings to quarrel once more for the empire of hindostan these two people of central asia were those of iran the tillers and those of iwran or the horsemenwanderersthe indoeuropean and the mongolian the author traces very ingeniously the corruption of the frost giants whose skulls thor had such a habit of splitting like walnuts to the meaner lubberly trolls whom jack always got the better of he shows us how in myths from the foes of the gods these giants became the largeheaded weaklegged dolts of our pantomimes and nursery stories as for odin he turned into the wild huntsman just as heathen wells became the founts of churcheschristianity putting its broad arrow on all the old pagan goods and chattels the monkish stories made the saints wander about and have adventures just as odin did who used to stroll into the forges of village smiths and get his heavenly horse newly shod frigga odins wife the goddess of industry and plenty is still worshipped under the name of the virgin of the fabulous golden agean old pagan tradition annexed and christened by the monksdr dasent tells us a very strange and epical legend that we cannot for the heart of us forbear copying the remembrance of the bountiful frodi echoed in the songs of german poets long after the story which made him so bountiful had been forgotten  but the norse skalds could tell not only the story of fredis wealth and bounty but also of his downfall and ruin in frodis house were two maidens of that old giant race fenja and menja these daughters of the giant he had bought as slaves and he made them grind his quern or handnull grotti out of which he used to grind peace and gold even in that golden age one sees there were slaves and frodi however bountiful to his thanes and people was a hard taskmaster to his giant handmaidens he kept them to the mill nor gave them longer rest than the cuckoos note lasted or they could sing a song but that quern was such that it ground anything that the grinder chose though until then it had ground nothing but gold and peace so the maidens ground and ground and one sang their piteous tale in a strain worthy of eschylus as the other restedthey prayed for rest and pity but frodi was deaf then they turned in giant mood and ground no longer peace and plenty but fire and war then the quern went fast and furious and that very night came mysing the searover and slew frodi and all his men and carried off the quern and so frodis peace ended the maidens the searover took with him and when he got on the high seas he bade them grind salt so they ground and at midnight they asked him if he had not salt enough but he bade them still grind on so they ground till the ship was full and sank mysing maids and mill and all and thats why the sea is salt perhaps of all the tales in this volume none could be selected as better proving the toughness of a traditional belief than no ii which tells why the sea is salt the norse had no idea of that devil whom the monks magiclanterned till he grew so large as to be all but omnipresent and omniscient as for hel she was the goddess who kept the nine keys of the place of death where all went who were unlucky enough not to die laughing on the field of battle waning for odin in some of these stories of our philologist the heathen clement and antiquity is singularly perceptible as in  the master smith where the hero thinks he has done a silly thing in quarrelling with the deviland in not a pin to choose between them where peter the husband of the silly goody goes about begging for alms from door to door in paradise the transformations of men into beasts are numerousas in the greek and roman stories which perhaps are of scythian origin the werewolf or manwolf is a frequent character in the old legends but the favourite beast for norse transformation is the bearwhose strength and sagacity made him an object of wonder and respect with the sturdy woodmen of norway who even now think the finns and lapps can assume the shape of animals the lapps disowning this magical power still call the bear grandfather look on him with awe beg his pardon as they cut his throat bring him back to their tent with apologetic ceremonies declaring that  grandfather whom they have killed had the strength of ten men and the wit of twelve greylegs wolf is a kindlygrateful beast in the old storiesand the horses save their masters out of peril and bear them to fortune the dog makes no great figurebut the goat occasionally being sacred to thor appears in force and with supernatural attributes the trolls seem to have been more pucklike and malignant than the giants they were weaker and therefore more malicious they seem to have devoted their lives to injure man and mans works sometimes they are represented as thieves and cannibals they dwell in the spins of the fells in the dried pineforest in dens to which they carry off the children of men helpless lads and beautiful maidens they guard the riches and sit in clefts of the rocks surrounded by threadneedle streets full of gold and silver they haunt the dark forest by day and feast by night to see the sun was fatal to themif once it looked them full in the face they burst in sheer spite fear horror and disgust about all these storiescrystalsided and sparkling with fancies rare and fantastic as the shapes that icicles assume  there is a bluff honesty refreshing as the rough wind that chills one minute and the next sends the warm blood in a red gush to the buffeted cheek hindu stories are tropically overlaid with imagery the arabs are keen and bright as their sabres and damascened with tropes and episodes the german are simple hearty and full of kindly humour the swedish are stiffer and more matteroffact but the norse are full of birdmusic and have a fragrance about them of wild flowers and the aromatic pineforest the men they paint are norsedaring fellows who die making the best of it fighting with the last inch of sword and after thattill the hand is lopped off they speak bluntly but never pervert morality or deny the true principles of right and wrong they

familywho basks in the quiet selfconsciousness of hidden strength and who at last uprises like david to slay the philistine or rather to tame the magic horse ride up the slippery glass hill and win the princess though good the brave and the true are always praised this shows the just moral standard of though norse writer as for the women they are not very strongly drawn  but then they are generally bright good tender and helpfulforgetting themselves in their eagerness to help others as dr dasent says of the heroine justly   when she goes down thc well after the unequal match against her stepsister in spinning bristles against bax she steps tenderly over the hedge milks the cow shears the sheep reueves the boughs of the appletreeall out of the natural goodness of her heart when she is sent to fetch water from the well she washes and brushes and even kisses the loathsome head she bebeves what her enemies say even to her own wrong and injury she sacrifices all that she holds most dear and at last even herself because she is made to believe that it is her brothers wish and so on her too the good powers smile she can understand and profit by what the little birds say she knows how to choose the right casket and at last after many trials all at once the scene changes and she receives a glorious reward while the wicked stepmother and her ugly daughter meet with a just fate nor is another female character less tenderly drawn in bacon grizzlebeard no v where we bee the proud haughty princess subdued and tamed by natural affection into a faithful loving wife we sympathise with her more than with the patient grizzel of the poets who is in reality too good for her story has no relief while in bacon grizzlebeard we begin by being angry at the princesss pride we are glad at the retribution which overtakes her but we are gradually melted at her sufferings and hardships when she gives up all for the beggar and follows him we burst into tears with her when she exclaims  oh the beggar and the babe and the cabin and we rejoice with her when the prince says  here is the beggar and there is the babe and so let the cabin burn away there is something in very truth inimitable about these storiesas for instance the yankee vein of lying in the boots who made the princess say  thats a storywhich is a narrative of a witty younger son who is promised the hand of an exaggerating princess if he can make her express her wonder at his yarns about others as the gutnt who had no heart in his body there is an inexhaustible vein of imagination which even the  arabian nights though fuller of colour cannot rival in this as in so many of the norse stories there is a younger son who from natural kindness of heart on his way to other adventures helps neglected animals who in their turn aid him in moments of emergencya kindly moral not unuseful in its way he feeds a halfstarved raven slopes a salmon stranded on a shallow into deeper waterand gives his old horse to feed a wolf who in gratitude leads him to the giants house at this cannibals house he finds a princess who promises to aid him in killing the giant her masterbut the difficulty is that he does not carry his heart life about with him and keeps it a secret where it is hidden the faithful couple look everywhere for the giants heartunder the doorsill in the cupboardeverywhere but in vain like samson he will not betray his secret to dalilah till after much treacherous wheedling and pressing at last the very foolish monster confesses that far away in a lake lies an island on that island stands a church in that church is a well in that well swims a duck in that duck there is an egg and in that egg his heart like the house that jack built these stories run round this sort of wheel and back again off goes boots the coalbiter the wolf carries him to the island the raven flies to the tower for the churchkeys the salmon fetches the egg from the well where the guardianduck had dropped it he squeezes it the giant screams and begs for mercy 500 miles off boots treacherously makes him under a tacit promise turn six brothers of his back from stone to fleshthen breaks the egg and the giant dies of course the story ends with a wedding and with the usual quip which has drawn down thousands of peals of laughter if they have not done feasting why they are still at it  popular tabs

the children are likely to give this book a very hearty welcome it consists of a series of the most delightful fairy tales from norway that land where the supernatural still lingers some of course are very old friends and have been read in the pages of hans anderssen grimm and ferrault but even they have a flavour of the north as if the author had gathered the variants from the lips of his neighbours and the translator deserves congratulation on the success with which his work is done he does not always attain the same level but more than once his rendering is divinely felicitous we might take  the lad with the beer keg  as an example and but for its length would quote it in justification of praise that may seem extravagant the subject itself is a singular mixture of the gruesome the humorous and the fantastical but the story is related as all fairy tales should be in the matteroffact unconcerned supremely natural style that pays no heed to the auditors reflection any more than to the credibility of the story god the devil and death come after the beer in the intimate and familiar yet not irreverent manner in which we can imagine they used to figure in an easter play or a christmas mumming and the racy colloquialism is maintained without recourse to slang or its equivalent the english is very pure as well as being simple and familiar we have alluded only to one story but dozens might be quoted in many the usages of modern life are introduced into the stories in a manner that seems to show that the norwegians believe as sincerely in trolls and fairies as ever they did nor would it be fair to omit from mention the very clever illustrations they are the original pictures made by three norwegian artistse werenskiold t kittelsen and 0 sinding it might perhaps be objected that they are too clever and original for children but the book is likely to be often referred to and a picture is none the worse for being able to bear a third or a fourth scrutiny nor does it after all demand a very mature judgement to recognise the character that beams from the three troll faces on p 15 or the brightness and humour in nearly every cut the book deserves the very highest

slavonic fairy tales collected and translated from the russian polish servian and bohemian slavonic folklore by john t naake of the british museum h s king  co serbian folklore popular tales selected and translated by madame csedomille mijatovies edited with an introduction by the rev w denton ma lsbister co by a strange coincidence two collections of slavonic tales have appeared simultaneously in an english dress as we have already been favoured with a tolerably large assortment of similar stories from russia we may we presume assume that more interest is taken now than formerly in the literatures of the slavonic peoples in german schools it is said russian is at present largely taught france is opening her eyes to the fact that french is no longer the universal tongue it once professed to be and is directing her attention to the difficult speech of the manymillioned russian people in whom she recognises her natural allies even in our insular stronghold on this side of the channel across which foreign tongues have found it so hard to make their way books are beginning to appear which deal with slavonic subjects without displaying either ignorance or contempt perhaps one explanation of this strange phenomenon may be found in the fact that many of them are themselves of slavonic origin thus in the present instance a polish translator introduces a sample of  slavonic fairy tales a servian translator presents us with two selections from  serbian folklore similarly a russian princess has lately made available for english readers a romance by a russian count one advantage of this novel system is that we are secured against the terrible blunders into which the old school of translators used to fall and foreign authors are spared the intense sufferings to which they were too often exposed in dealing with the books now before us we may be certain that they do justice to their originals and therefore we may judge their contents on their own merits mr naake tells us in the preface to his attractive little volume that the bohemian tales perhaps through the genius of the poets who have preserved them have in their original form more art more grace more completeness of outline than the others the natural inference to be drawn from these words is although the writer may not have meant to suggest it that the bohemian ladies and gentlemen who have acted as the amanuenses of the common people have added graces of their own to the simple recitals of uncultured storytellers very poetical for instance is the account of how lidushka finds that every time she lifts one of the reversed jars which stand in the kitchen of the subaqueous frogdemon a little white dove flies out from under it joyfully flutters its wings and disappears these doves are  the souls of the unfortunate people whom the waterdemon had drawn into his power and had cruelly drowned so also when irik in  golden hair seeks the enchanting daughter of the king of the palace of crystal he is told that every morning at the break of day she combs her golden locks its brightness ia reflected on the sea and up among the clouds and again when the mischievous yanechek has fallen into the hands of a waterdemon his mother renders herself invisible to the fiend by fasting for three weeks whereupon we learn that her body dried up and became as thin as a shadow  her mothers love alone kept her alive for that love was her only food and her only comfort the polish tales are said to reflect the passive virtues and genial warmth of the peasants whose lives they illustrate we should rather be inclined to say that the specimens given in the present volume show a morbid taste for horrors and a strong inclination on the part of the polish peasants to refer the miseries of human life to diabolical agencies in them we see a magician hoisted by his own whirlwind and sent flying through space attended by innumerable crowswe watch the terrible procession of the spirit of the pestilencewe hear the village dogs bark furiously as the plague goes by in the guise of a tall woman clothed in white with dishevelled hairand we listen to the screech uttered by an evileyed parent as he plucks from their sockets the illomened orbs which he fears will blast the prospects of his newborn babe the russian stories are characterized we are told by  a greater simplicity amounting even to childishness the servian are in some features unique and may be found the most interesting of the series this remark certainly holds good in the case of the servian legend which accounts for the sole of mans foot being uneven the explanation is as follows when the evil spirits were turned out of heaven they took the sun with them the devil carrying it stuck on a lance across his shoulder the archangel michael was sent to recover it but could not do so for a long time at last however he induced the devil to dive into the sea caused its surface to freeze hard as soon as the fiend had disappeared beneath it and set off at full speed for heaven carrying with him the sun which the devil had been obliged to leave on the shore for fear of drying up the sea if he took it with him up came the devil to the froeen surface summoned by the screams of a magpie he had left in charge burst through the ioy obstacle and gave chase to the flying archangel the good spirit succeeded in getting into heaven with his prize but just as he crossed the threshold the evil one tore a piece of flesh out of the sole of one of his feet by way of consolation  from that day there appeared a small hollow in the sole of mans foot and thus it has remained unto this day this story is the gem of mr naak6s collection which may be recommended as a pleasant and unpretentious little work well arranged and conscientiously translated suitable as a present for children and by no means devoid of attraction for more scholarly readers of its four illustrations if regarded from a slavonic point of view the less said the better madame csedomille mijatovies qu mijatovics serbian folklore is a more bulky work than mr naakes some of the tales running to considerable length to such length indeed that they become tedious it is preceded by an excellent preface contributed by mr denton a wellknown authority on servian affairs who in it treats the vexed questions of the origin and the meaning of folk tales with much discretion and judgment from it we gather some interesting information about the servian storytellers during the summer evenings the young girls in servian villages gather in groups beneath some widespreading tree and occupy themselves in spinning while some older woman tells stories for their benefit such stories are always in prose but when men take up thc wondrous tale they throw it into verse and accompany it by the monotonous sounds of the gusle at times somewhat unromantic incidents supply a theme to these rustic minstrels mr denton tells us that long tedious debates in the national parliament of 1870 on the right of opening shops in villages as distinguished from towns were treated by these homely bards the whole discussion was thrown into the shape of a lengthy song and recited in the open air before village assemblies and so as mr denton observes the servian practice of the present day forms an excellent instance of the manner in which  a servian homer would naturally have communicated to his countrymen all the details of meetings at the councilboard and skirmishes in the plain which diversified the history of a siege in the fortunes of which their interest was enlisted the stories in the present collection show no trace of ever having had a metrical form so it may be supposed if mr denton s statement is correct that they are due to female narrators about half of them are taken from the collection rendered familiar to western readers by the excellent german translation published in 1854 at berlin the rest are taken from a bosniac collection made by young theological students members of the college at dyakovo in croatia they form a valuable contribution to the stockintrade of storiologists who will do well to add these new volumes to their already groaning shelves  slavonic fairy tales i    collected and traine latect from the rusgian polish servian and bohemian by john t naak6 of the british museum with four

parts of the country is fawt dying out of the memo ries of the people servia was fortunate enough early to produce an enthnsiastic collector of its songs and stories vuk stefanovich karajich and bosnia has quite recently put forth a collection of its popular tales made by the bosnian theological students at the college of dyakovo in croatia but the tales of poland bohemia and moravia and those specially belonging to the wends of lusatia have as yet attracted little scientific attention various collections have been made it is true but they have never been methodical they have not always been trustworthy to many of the polish and bohemian legends an artificial splendour has now and then been added by means of literary gilding the raw material supplied by rustic hands has been sometimes sub mitted by culture to a culinary process for which earnest storycomparers are by no means grateful still many genuine stories have been brought together in various col lections for a knowledge of which most scholars have hitherto been indebted mainly to wenzigs excellent westelawischer mar chenschatz english readers now have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with eleven polish and eight bohemian stories as well as with eight russian and thirteen servian in mr naakes modest but serviceable collection of slavonic fairy taleo its contents are as a general rule well chosen and they are translated with a fidelity which deserves cordial praise the russian stories contained in the present volume are not very good specimens of their class the  snowchild is not a folktale but a literary mans or womans imitation of one in genuine folktales it is not uncommon to find a babe developed for the solace of childless parents out of a pea or a twig or an egg or the like but a child made of snow whose eyes looked like two forgetmenots and who eventually  melted away and changed in an instant into a beautiful white cloud rose up and disappeared in the sky for ever belongs not to the peasants hut but to the ro mancers study the  story of gol voyansky  is a chapbook  version of the wellknown tale in which a killer of flies first pretends to be a hero and then performs or at least appears to perform heroic feats the gallant warriors who keep him company belong to the band of heroes who figure in the russian builita8 or metrical romances on which the compilers of the russian equivalents for our chapbooks have freely drawn one of them eraslan lazarevich has been clearly iden tified with the persian rustem the story of vasilisa with the golden tress who is saved from an abducting dragon by her brother ivan the pea is a better specimen but its chapbook origin is clearly proved by the factamong othersthat the double operation requisite for the resuscitation of a dead hero is slurred over in it whereas great stress is always laid upon its twofold nature in the genuine folktales the same test may be safely applied to the story of little simpleton which like that of ivan krachina is a medley of various episodes taken from a number of independent tales the  book of magic  is in all pro bability a western story of witchcraft which has made its way into russia and then become turned into a  soldier story the legends of  spirit treasures  are curious if they can be relied upon but the similarity between the cat which  crumbled into gold pieces or the spectre which crumbled into old copper money and the wellknown gold men of buddhist moral fiction is too close to be free from suspicion some of the polish stories bear manifest signs of literary handicraft a belief in the malignity of an  evil eye  may exist in poland though it certainly does not flourish in any slavonic land as it does in the south of europe but it could never have given rise in a peasants mind to such a piling up of horrors as is exhibited by wojeickis story of which a transtion has been given by mr naak there exists it may be remarked a german translation of lewestam of wojcickis collection but it is rare and little known according to the story in question a polish gentleman had such evil eyes that all was blighted at which he looked and so he was obliged to pas most of his time in regarding a bundle of peastrawthat product of nature being comparatively insensible to bad looks at last however he fell in love and married after a time his wife begia to wither under his too ardent gaze in vain did he request her to extract his eyes so he determined that he would by his own hands deprive himself of the power of blighting his ex pected babe soon afterwards two cries unlike in their sound were heard in the house the onethe joyful cry of a newborn infant as it first saw the light the otherthe agonised cry of a man the infants father as he parted with sight for ever his eyes glittering like two diamonds lay on the ground by the side of a bloodstained knife after this his life was everything he could wish but an in quisitive servant who knew what had taken place one day unfortunately for bimself dug up his masters eyes  suddenly they glared upon him like two live coals as soon as their baneful light shone upon his wrinkled face the old man shivered fell down and died this sort of romancing is quite in the ca8tle of otranto vein and may please some minds more than the cruder monstrosities which occur in unmanipulated folktales another of the polish stories that of the  hares heart is founded upon a genuine superstition but it has been manifestly elaborated the notion that a mans courage is subtly connected with his material heart is common to many peoples among some of whom it is or was a common practice for a warrior to fortify or encourage himself by feeding upon the heart of a conquered bear or foemn in the polish story a converse operation is performed a brave mans heart is extracted and a hares put in its place from that time forward he was far worse than chiekenhearted so timid did he become that when one day a swallow which was flying past struck him on the head with ibs wing the blow was fatal the poor knight fell down as if struck by lightning and soon afterwards died the polish stories of  carried away by the wind the demons dance the plague omen the  plage the  plague and the peasant and venwolves are all closely in keeping with the superstition though theyr are not told in the language of the people there is always a tendency in uncultured minds towards personifying an epidemic in times of plague and pestilence the destroying force readily takes a human shape to anxious and unenlightened eyes there is something mysteriously grand in these pictures due to the popular fancy of the onward sweep of the ghastly form of the destroyer accompanied by its terrible train the word homen which occurs in a story called by a strange coincidence  the plague omen is intended to express the noisy movement of this pestilenceprocession being akin to gain or gain a confused noise whence oome gomit to brawl and a number of kindred words expressive of loud but inarticulate sound the story of madey is the well known mediaeval legend of the criminal who is told by a dignitary of the church that his sins will not be forgiven until a dead stick has become a living tree even tually the stick does become a tree and bears fruit and the criminal is forgiven in the polish story as the criminal confesses his crimes the apples on a tree beside which he kneels turn into snowwhite doves and fly awaythe last being  the soul of madeys father whom he had murdered for some time the sinner cannot bring himself to confess his greatest sin at last however he does so the ultimate fruit flies away as a dove and the pardoned penitent crumbles into dust in this version the essential idea that of the dead stick taking life has been forgotten whereas due prominence will be found given to it in the lithuanian story schleicher no 26 which it in many respects closely resembles in a little russian version given by afanasief legenz dui p 178 the tree bears a number of silver apples and two of gold the fruits answer to the robbers crimes the golden apples signifying his sins of patricide and matricide he confesses to all but the last two and so he dies while the golden a ples still hang on the boughs and  worse han all other sinners is he tortured in the lower world afanasief in commenting on the polish story refers the appletree in cident to old heatheu ideas about the soul some critics may be inclined to refer it rather to the imagination of the literary reciter the bohemian stories in mr naak6s collection are specially interesting inasmuch as they contain a good deal of genuine folk4ore respecting hobgoblins and watersprites to this day slavonic rustics firmly believe that spirits almost invariably of a malicious character haunt pools and streams and therefore those of their stories which deal with such beings are of a more original natutre than those tales of eastern origin which refer to sevenheaded snakes and other asiatic monsters in which they do not believe in the story of  lidushka and the water demons wife a peasant woman consents to become godmother to a frogs child and descends into the sub aqueous world in the palace of the frog demon who answers to the russian waterking she finds a room in which stand rows of little jars she lifts them one after another and out of each flies a white dove these doves  were the souls of the unfortunate people whom the water demon had drawn into his power and had cruelly drowned each soul had been kept in a separate dark prison in the shape of a little jar lidushka was the deliverer of them al this is exceedingly picturesque but as in the case of the applebirds the white doves have a suspicious air the idea has been worked out by mr keightley in his fairy mythology in the story of the soul cages  jack discovers that his friend coomara the merrow is in the habit of imprisoning in lobsterpots the souls of drowned sailors so he secretly opens the soulcages and releases their invisible inmates to a subsequent edition of this oftenquoted story mr keightley ap pended the following note  we must here make an honest confession this story had no foundation but the german legend in p 259 all that is not to be found there is our own pure invention we should like to see a conscientious edition of west slavonic and many other storieswith notes in the story of lidushka as well as in that of yanechek the water demon often takes the shape of  a beautiful red waterplant floating on the top of the water in both stories the souls of the drowned are imprisoned by the watersprite on the tricksy spirit who has inurned the bad boy yanechek that boys mother lays her hands and ties him up in her cottage with a ninefold rope of bast when yane chek has been released from his prisonhouse he treacherously endeavours to kill the bound demon but in his awkwardness merely cuts his bonds the demon upsets a jug containing a few drops of water which become a strong flood like a summer torrent among the mountains and drown the wicked yanechek and his weak minded indulgent mother whose souls are immediately potted by the water demon no one can complain that the bohemian tales are devoid of moral teaching the wicked wood fays is a good story in itself but it sounds much more like a servian than a bohemian tale in servia the vilas really do in popular belief tear out the eyes of unwary mortals it seems to be doubtful whether in bohemia they ever behaved in a fashion so much more savage and unmeaning than that which characterises their sister spirits in other western and northern slavonic lands it is difficult to believe that in the land of the czqkhs there ever existed a cave where there was a large heap of eyes great and small black red blue and green even although some of them may have belonged to owls and others to fish its locality may really have been farther east where the milder traditions of the slavs became influenced by the fierce superstitions of the turkish and finnish races of the servian tales contained in mr naak6s collection we will not speak at present but before taking leave of his   prettily got up volume we ought to mention that its contents fully come up to the promise held out in its preface the flowers plucked not for their scientific interest but for the wild fresh perfume that clings about them will justly give pleasure to many admirers who have not sufficiently cultivated their literary perceptions to be able to distinguish between the perfumes of the library and the field to children in particular the book may be confidently recommended the stories it contains are all the more suited for them in that theywith the exception perhaps of those from serviahave been trimmed and pruned by able editors but not by mr naak6 who has worked quite honestly before being exhibited to the public to them also the illustrations which they may

basque legends  collected chiefly in the la bourd by the rev wentworth webster u a a is with an essay on the basque language by m julien vinson griffith  farran so difficult is the basque language that tradition asserts that the prince of darkness himself was obliged to abandon it in despair after having spent seven whole years in fruitlessly attempting to learn it as a specimen of the grammatical complications in which those who study it from without are involved may be mentioned one of the peculiarities of the conjugation of its verb the possession namely on the part of that verb of eleven moods and ninetyone tenses variable according to the sex or rank of the person addressed no wonder that as m vinson says in the tough but valuable essay appended to the present work the basque language is one which is particularly attractive to specialists it may be assumed however that the majority of the readers of mr websters pretty collection of  legends will not be profoundly interested in that tongue in spite of the fact that  its place in the general series of idioms has at last been well defined  it is an agglutinative and incorporating language with some tendency to polvsynthetism it consequently finds a place in the second great morphological linguistic group between the finnic and the north american family of languages like etruscan it has always possessed a fascination for the amateur as well as the professional philologist and over it as over etruscan the amateur has before now experienced some heavy falls the keen and by no means inexcusable desire of many a dilettante linguist is to grapple at once with the hardest problems which have baffled whole generations of trained scholars and about the origin and affinities of both basque and etruscan such things have been said as might well make the old inhabitants of etruria and the pyrenees turn in their urns or their graves or at least put on record a remonstrance through the medium of a table but the book now before us does not sin in this direction m vinson speaks with authority and his remarks must be listened to with respect and so few englishmen have taken the trouble to learn basque that mr webster thoroughly deserves all possible encouragement to continue his labours and to give the world more of the fruits arising from them but in writing about the  legends  of the basques he must proceed with rather more caution than is shown in his present book his knowledge of popular tales in general appears to be mainly drawn from mr campbells  tales of the west highlands an admirable book but one which throws light upon but a small portion of a very wide field the natural consequence of this is that mr webster is always laying stress upon similarities between the basques and the kelts it is not clear whether he suspects that their languages are akin but he evidently imagines that basque popular tales are more allied with keltic than with any other similar stories we have chosen the designation keltic he says  because the burning question concerning the basques at present is their relation to the keltic race undoubtedly the question is a burning one in one sense anybody who takes it up without very special knowledge of both basque and keltic is exceedingly likely to burn his fingers he goes on to say what is perfectly true that the basque stories are like the keltic but he adds  whether they have a closer affinity with them than with the general run of indoeuropean mythology may be an open question it may seem so to mr webster who does not once refer to and therefore may be supposed to be unacquainted with the works of yon hahn bernhard schmidt and others on modern greek folklore or those of gonzenbach and pitrc on sicilian popular tales or of wenzig on west slavonian or of schott on wallachian  or of vuk karadjich and mijatovics on servian not to speak of the numerous untranslated works with which a western critic cannot fairly be expected to be familiar of course be was by no means bound to read the whole literature of folktales before bringing out a collection of basque legends but it is dangerous for an editor who has not done so to indulge in critical observations on the origin of the stories he introduces to the public to the scientificcomparerof stories the basque tales will offer little that is new but he will be glad to possess them for they to some extent fill up a gap which has long remained open it was supposed by some comparative mythologists that the basque legends as being those of a people quite distinct at all events linguistically from the aryan family would offer new features but those which mr webster has laid before us possess little novelty as he himself remarks some are closely allied with keltic tales others are evidently versions of modern french stories of the perrault and daulnoy type the supernatural beings however who figure in them are interesting the basa jaun and basa andre or ogre and ogress and the lamiiiak or fairies the legends also about the herensuge the basque representative of the serpent or dragon family so notorious in popular fiction are important if they are trustworthy some of the casual references in the tales to sorcery are very interesting the basques are great believers in magic and witches used to flourish amongst them in spite of pierre de lancre who by the terrors of his hideous inquisition in 1609 produced a moral epidemic and burnt numerous victims at st jean de luz the last person thus put to death there was a portuguese lady who was charged in 1619 with secreting the host for magic purposes while her case was being investigated in the church a number of fishermen about to start for newfoundland who dared not set sail while such a crime was unpunished seized upon her and burnt her facts of this kind are always worth recording if mr webster will give us a book about the basques made up of such facts or of popular fictions carefully sifted and printed without other comment than may be demanded by difficulties arising from basque words or customs and the likethat is to say without theories hypotheses or mythological comparisons or explanationsthen he will be conferring a real benefit on the small number of readers who know a little about the basques and the great number to whom the language and literature of those  aborigines

basque legends  collected chiefly in the la bourd by the rev wentworth webster u a a is with an essay on the basque language by m julien vinson griffith  farran so difficult is the basque language that tradition asserts that the prince of darkness himself was obliged to abandon it in despair after having spent seven whole years in fruitlessly attempting to learn it as a specimen of the grammatical complications in which those who study it from without are involved may be mentioned one of the peculiarities of the conjugation of its verb the possession namely on the part of that verb of eleven moods and ninetyone tenses variable according to the sex or rank of the person addressed no wonder that as m vinson says in the tough but valuable essay appended to the present work the basque language is one which is particularly attractive to specialists it may be assumed however that the majority of the readers of mr websters pretty collection of  legends will not be profoundly interested in that tongue in spite of the fact that  its place in the general series of idioms has at last been well defined  it is an agglutinative and incorporating language with some tendency to polvsynthetism it consequently finds a place in the second great morphological linguistic group between the finnic and the north american family of languages like etruscan it has always possessed a fascination for the amateur as well as the professional philologist and over it as over etruscan the amateur has before now experienced some heavy falls the keen and by no means inexcusable desire of many a dilettante linguist is to grapple at once with the hardest problems which have baffled whole generations of trained scholars and about the origin and affinities of both basque and etruscan such things have been said as might well make the old inhabitants of etruria and the pyrenees turn in their urns or their graves or at least put on record a remonstrance through the medium of a table but the book now before us does not sin in this direction m vinson speaks with authority and his remarks must be listened to with respect and so few englishmen have taken the trouble to learn basque that mr webster thoroughly deserves all possible encouragement to continue his labours and to give the world more of the fruits arising from them but in writing about the  legends  of the basques he must proceed with rather more caution than is shown in his present book his knowledge of popular tales in general appears to be mainly drawn from mr campbells  tales of the west highlands an admirable book but one which throws light upon but a small portion of a very wide field the natural consequence of this is that mr webster is always laying stress upon similarities between the basques and the kelts it is not clear whether he suspects that their languages are akin but he evidently imagines that basque popular tales are more allied with keltic than with any other similar stories we have chosen the designation keltic he says  because the burning question concerning the basques at present is their relation to the keltic race undoubtedly the question is a burning one in one sense anybody who takes it up without very special knowledge of both basque and keltic is exceedingly likely to burn his fingers he goes on to say what is perfectly true that the basque stories are like the keltic but he adds  whether they have a closer affinity with them than with the general run of indoeuropean mythology may be an open question it may seem so to mr webster who does not once refer to and therefore may be supposed to be unacquainted with the works of yon hahn bernhard schmidt and others on modern greek folklore or those of gonzenbach and pitrc on sicilian popular tales or of wenzig on west slavonian or of schott on wallachian  or of vuk karadjich and mijatovics on servian not to speak of the numerous untranslated works with which a western critic cannot fairly be expected to be familiar of course be was by no means bound to read the whole literature of folktales before bringing out a collection of basque legends but it is dangerous for an editor who has not done so to indulge in critical observations on the origin of the stories he introduces to the public to the scientificcomparerof stories the basque tales will offer little that is new but he will be glad to possess them for they to some extent fill up a gap which has long remained open it was supposed by some comparative mythologists that the basque legends as being those of a people quite distinct at all events linguistically from the aryan family would offer new features but those which mr webster has laid before us possess little novelty as he himself remarks some are closely allied with keltic tales others are evidently versions of modern french stories of the perrault and daulnoy type the supernatural beings however who figure in them are interesting the basa jaun and basa andre or ogre and ogress and the lamiiiak or fairies the legends also about the herensuge the basque representative of the serpent or dragon family so notorious in popular fiction are important if they are trustworthy some of the casual references in the tales to sorcery are very interesting the basques are great believers in magic and witches used to flourish amongst them in spite of pierre de lancre who by the terrors of his hideous inquisition in 1609 produced a moral epidemic and burnt numerous victims at st jean de luz the last person thus put to death there was a portuguese lady who was charged in 1619 with secreting the host for magic purposes while her case was being investigated in the church a number of fishermen about to start for newfoundland who dared not set sail while such a crime was unpunished seized upon her and burnt her facts of this kind are always worth recording if mr webster will give us a book about the basques made up of such facts or of popular fictions carefully sifted and printed without other comment than may be demanded by difficulties arising from basque words or customs and the likethat is to say without theories hypotheses or mythological comparisons or explanationsthen he will be conferring a real benefit on the small number of readers who know a little about the basques and the great number to whom the language and literature of those  aborigines are entirely unknown,folklore

kaffir folklore or a selection from the traditional tales current among the people living on the eastern border of the cape colony by george mccall theal son nenschein  co the stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,folklore

irish idylls by jane barlow hodder  stoughton the comparison between miss barlow and miss wilkins is a very obvious one for what one is to the humble new englander the other is to the dweller in the bogs of connaught each author reveals to us the life and habit of thought of a class hitherto but little known and eachpossesses the magic of clothing humdrum trifles with interest and charm but as the new englander and the wild irishman differ much from one anothernot only in way of life but in habit of thoughtit follows that the resemblance between the two writers is the result of many differences the new englander is shrewd protestant and struggling the connaught peasant idle dreamy and resigned and as each author has the power of making us live the life of her puppets and enter into their way of thought it follows that anything like imitation is impossible the irish idylls all occur in the desolate hamlet of lisconnel among cottars huddled together on a low hill or knockaun in the bog in a destitution never far removed from actual starvation  the hopes and cares of the inhabitants centre mainly in the little greydyked fields which make a plaid pattern on the hillside and along a meagre belt beneath and this renders it the more regretable that their most prolific and certain crop should be such an unremunerative one stones upon stones scattered broadcast by some malignant hundredhanded and perennially working up through the thin soil in mockery of tenfingered attempts to collect and keep them under those looselybuilt boundary walls which intersect so frequently that the bit of land looks as if a coarselymeshed net had been flung over it fail utterly to exhaust the supply in each diminutive field a great cairn of them is piled up as big sometimes as the tabin to which it belongs and still the husband fri man comes on them at every turn  every he where he can read written large an answer to an his demand for bread th still the people cling

hitherto shielded him more or less effectually but furthermore it provides him t with a daily return of business and desire a t clue to guide his wanderings through the mazes f of a destiny that at best seems to him sufficiently perplexing and inscrutable for he has 1 as a rule too much imagination and too little  of more material things to keep his mind clear of fateful riddles h is bit o land then is dear to the dweller in lisconnel not mainly  i a bit of land but rather as the fragment of solid tangible fact contact with which keeps i his whole existence from becoming the sport of meaningless mysteries  a meagre fieldfleck and a ramshackle shanty on the hills wan l grey slope or the lip of the blackoozing morass is scarcely an ideal earthly paradise yet it may be at least the site of the only one that can appear possible to him  should a sequel of calamity such as jobs overtake him sweeping away his flocks and herds and children no eventual doubling of his live stock could console him  and as for the ten new sons and daughtersthey would be a failure indeed the working of the irish peasant mind has seldom been indicated more clearly than in this passage and the thoughtful speculative turn of bogland brains reveals itself in a dozen racy conversations which the reader will find only too short though they are too long for quotation in character drawing miss barlow succeeds best with mature women old mrs kilfoyle the widdy mgurk and herself are admirable sketches and mad bell with her face  like a wizened lemon looking shrewdly up at you is a delightful creation but the girls are less living and the menwith perhaps the exception of poor larry sheridanare types rather than individuals like the characters in a modern play but in spite of this defect and of the authors excessive fondness for adjectives the irish idylls are delightful reading and afford a truer insight into irish peasant character and ways of life and thought than any hook that it has been our fortune to read for a long time  irish idylls i imagine that as this book goes the round of the reviews it will become a trite thing to call miss barlow an irish barrie like him she has found her book waiting her in a little and humble place of the earth like him she has the delicate observation that is the harvest of a quiet eye she has his gifts of tenderness of dignity of true and simple pathos of sympathy that comes by love like him she has a fine and beautiful vocabulary and a style that makes pictures to us irish she is more welcome than barrie can be to the scotch we are so long awaiting our real irish novelist while mr barrie comes in the line of succession to great men who have made the world intimate with scotland and scottish folk we have had no such interpreters carleton was too shapeless and too melancholy miss edgeworth despite her genius was oldmaidish and restricted the banims and gryphon did but piecemeal work at best miss lawless in our own day writes of the same sunless country and grey lives that miss barlow treats here but her  grania leaves one an impression of a solitary page of the story a single lonely figure desolate on a low shore amid a waste of waters there is many a lisconnel in ireland at the back of the bogs or  the back of god speed but who else could make of it not a human document but a human book fluttering whose pages we run all the gamut of emotions we have here the human tragedy in such pathetic things as one too many or  herself miss barlow has the gift of tears in verse or prose and as one could scarcely read th old master to take one of her poems without a  irish idylls by jane barlow london hodder and stoughton catch in the throat so it is not easy to be dryeyed over poor larry sheridan and his homely tragedy or over mrs odriscoll and the children going to america but what good honest pathos it is none of the unwholesome things that take you by the throat with a stony horror like those that stalk out of ibsen and the russians irish idylls leaves us more human and kindly when it has wrung our hearts then the humour is truly delightful what a child only we see too little of him is jimmy kilfoyle and what mingled humour and pathos is the warp and woof of all their lives one gets to know them mrs doyne and stacy dear little mrs kilfoyle and mr mcgurk and all the other worthies of lisconnel as if one were going in and out every day among them the humanity is not starved olt of lisconnel it is an innocent little community indeed in which the only thing starved out seems to be vice miss barlow sees not only the primitive lives but the lonely country and the wild skies that seem a part of it she has superb descriptive bits which paint us pictures as finely as any sky painter or painter of moors who works in the legitimate medium i wish i had space to quote the skies that flash into her pictures fixed for us in her nervous and fine english it would not be easy to better this all at once something happened in the western sky it was as if some vast tentrope had suddenly been snapped for the dark riftless cloudcanopy seemed not so much to abruptly rise as to actually recoil back with a swing up from the horizons verge and ere one had realised that it had begun to lift it was flying eastward scudding in festoons and trails and shreds or furled into rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering blasts i believe  irish idylls will be an irish classic i have read every line of it with increasing delight and am glad messrs hodder and stoughton have bound it so substantially not like your mushrooms of a season miss barlow writes a little more from the outside than does barrie this is shown by her occasional slip in the matter of the brogue though she has much mended since  bogland studies another matter in which she does not see far is that in such lives as these religion would be a far more potent element than she makes it katharine tynan  irish ways by jane barlow illus trated by warwick goble allen  sons miss jane barlows reputation as a writer of irish tales or rather irish sketches of character is too high to require any recommendation from us this new instalment has all the merits of her previous volumes but it does not manifest any advance in her art the style is finished and shows evidence of high education and long familiarity with classical and modern literature hence it is remarkable that she should confine herself to so narrow a field where that large learning can show itself only indirectly and where a love of nature and an insight into peasant character form the whole matter of the volume there is but little plot in her stories  the elements of broad farce and of wild tragedy are not there but we find endless quiet humour and deep appreciation of the virtues and foibles of one of the most attractive peasantries of europe the opening chapter  ourselves and our island gives a summary of the complexities of irish character very similar to the larger but not so subtle treatment by mr lynd which we noticed on october 23rd but when we penetrate into the book we find that two or three leading types which other books treat at great length are ignored by miss barlow we say ignored for it is inconceivable that she does not know them the first is the roman catholic priest and indeed the protestant clergyman whose influence on the life of the poor is so great yet so disputed there is occasionally a priest in her backgrounds but as a character she will not tolerate him the same is the case with the local agitator and thirdly there is the gombeen man local moneylender who haunts every village and every market in poorer ireland and gives ample scope to the painter of irish life as for example to william carleton yet though this is the author who has most in common with miss barlow she omits these three types as carefully as the letters upon ireland are omitted from the published correspondence of queen victoria we can offer no clue to this negative feature in miss barlows irish stories but we must say that it limits her field and makes her gallery of local types smaller and more monotonous if she also omits the jackeen and the buckeen the apes of the squireen she would doubtless reply that she writes only about the very poor and only about the country poor who have exceptional manners no one knows better than miss barlow how to bring out this feature in her tales  and she paints the life and feelings of these indigent but refined peasants with a charm that has fascinated the reading public of our day her descriptions of the scenery of bogs and moors and of wild western coasts is often truly poetical indeed she allows herself the licence of french rather than english prose in this respect the beauties of bogland are by no means obvious yet no man who has travelled that sort of country deliberately as for example for sport will hesitate to acknowledge the truth and accuracy of her observation the writing down of dialect is always difficult some eminent irish novelists are very deficient in the power of hearing the sounds and catching the idioms such is not the case with miss barlow though we are not always in agreement with her we make the following suggestions as she surely professes to give the ordinary diction of western peasants and not their occasional use of strange words though the eastern irish speak of an awkward person as a thwart we do not remember the verb  to thwart in their use or with like limitation the verb  to question the irishman does not say  i question whether this is true but i doubt if it is so to be surprised  is also unusual though  surprizin  is common  and the pronunciation  scandeelious  for  scandlous  is new to us the irish know a spruce tree well enough but a spruce lad is a use of the adjective which is surely uncommon  should you suppose is also to be rejected  shall  and  should  being very unusual and replaced by  will  and  would the general impression which the english will draw from the book is that the western irish peasant is not the gay rollicking careless figure of angloirish fiction but rather a patient hardworking creature living in such squalor and gloom as to make his life a prolonged effort against despair miss barlows peasants represent the preceltic population often called firbolgs which was subdued by the invading celts and either exiled to the mountains and bogs of the west or reduced to the condition of churls who tilled the land for the tyrannous and ungrateful celtic swordsmen and their chiefs the hard treatment which the latter received from the english was probably a mere repetition of what had happened ten or fifteen centuries earlier when the celts were the invading conquerors it would be an interesting inquiry to trace the influences of this earlier stratum  probably pre  aryan  on the life of ireland but these are speculations regarding remote and forgotten causes which have drawn us away from the living pictures of today which are the object of this book we need hardly say in conclusion that we commend it strongly to our readers a word of praise should be added for the excellent illustrations of mr goble,folklore

townsend routledge  sons the princess i late a fairy talc saunders otley co mrs s c halls latest publication is a very pretty and rather whimsical story about little peoplewe can hardly call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of sounder work and better art are several wellexecuted landscapes from drawings by messrs e m wimperis and w s coleman mr w j allen is a very happy contributor of vignettes and tailpieces bright thoughts for the little ones is a book for infants the novelty of which consistsso far as we see the notion is a new onein the fact that little pieces of verse are made to alternate and proceed from little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him the event of the scorpion that attacked skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds grim hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend jack there is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told the illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  washed a shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved from its violence one of these is a dashing midshi pman who tells a young laxlya very young ladythat man friday was notablackwhatever defoe might have written there is also a very good blind pedlar a hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers especially as a considerable amount of local colouring is applied to descriptions of southern islands and the manners of their inhabitants the discovery of the longlost son of the old seacaptain who lived in the ancient tower and the narrative of that sons adventures make up jjr a sort of robinson crusoe stry that is well worthy the attention of the readers for whom the book is written three

we not long since reviewed croxaus production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation the illustrations which are thu work of mr harrison weir are very unequal in quality some are good as the fawn and his mother the crow and the  pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures the worst of i the book as a whole is that their author has not  the slightest sense of the eopian humour here i as in other respects no one of modern times has i approached the happiness of thomas bewick in his old

serious and highlyrespectable  young lady in a drawingroom this angel is spoken of as male his notions are those of neither one sex nor the other  which is orthodox no doubt although the effect on the reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has

folktake of bengal by the rev lal behari day macmillan in his excellent work on peasant life in bengal mr lal behari daya convert to christianity who holds a professorship in hooghly collegerepresented the young govinda a hindu boy as listening with delight every evening to the tales told him by an old woman who was the best storyteller in the village having read that passage capt r c temple who is himself doing good work in northern india as a collector of native folklore wrote to the author suggesting that he should make a collection of  those unwritten stories which old women in india recite to little children in the evenings the result is the present volume which forms m worthy supplement to the old deccan days and the indian fairy talest those two admirable collections of similar stories for which we are indebted to miss mary frere and miss maive stokes some of the twoandtwenty tales which it comprises or at least certain of their episodes will be recognised as old friends by readers who are conversant with indian popular fiction but there are others which will be generally considered as novel while all of them offer many features of interest as a specimen of the stories of the first class may be taken that of phakir chand the most interesting part of this evidently composite narrative is that which tells how a faithful retainer saved his lord from various dangers was turned into an image of stone when he explained why he had done so and was ultimately restored to life thanks to the sacrifice of the grateful lords child the story is that of  faithful john grimm no 6 der getreue johannes of rama and luxman  old deccan days no 5 and of zo ouorvo basiles pentamerone no 39 in the variant related to miss frere the sacrifice of the child at the end has been singularly modified the infant is not put to death it accidentally touches the petrified retainer who immediately comes to life the idea is pretty and poetic but not the least in accordance withthe sentiment of the story in its original form in basiles adaptation the sacrifice is preserved a grateful king killing his two children in order to bring to life the marble statue which had been his trusty brother the innocent victims are then resuscitated by the kings fatherirlaw who is a conjuror in the folktales of bengal the child in question is  cut into two and the marble image is besmeared with its blood the faithful retainer comes to life but the death of the child weighs upon his mind at length it occurs to him to ask his wife to intercede with the goddess kali on the infants behalf she does so and the prayer is granted the story of  the indigent brahman  is one of the tales which has become as familiar in europe as in asia it is told here of a brahman who was very poor his gains were considerable when marriages were celebrated or funeral ceremonies were performed but as his parishioners did not marry every day neither did they die every day he found it difficult to make the two ends meet he was a zealous worshipper of durga the consort of siva and  on no day did he either drink water or taste food till he had written in red ink the name of durga at least one hundred and eight times at last the grateful goddess presented him with a magic pipkin from which sweetmeats flowed when it was stolen from him durga gave him another from which hostile demons issued who compelled the thief to give back what he had abstracted in this story we have an intelligible reason given for the presentation of the supernatural utensil the counterpart of whioha magic wallet or knapsack or the likeis often somewhat capriciously bestowed on the heroes of similar european folktales the story of prince sobur no 8 contains two incidents which have been rendered familiar to the west by the tales of  beauty and the beast and  the blue bird a merchant sailing to a foreign port found that his ship remained motionless until he complied with the whim of his youngest daughter who had ordered him to bring back for her from foreign parts a mysterious substance named sobur this turned out to be a magical fan with a lookingglass in it when the fan was shaken by the girl a prince appeared whom she married her sisters became envious so u they broke several bottlesjreduced the broken pieces into fine powder and scattered it profusely on the bed the prince suspecting no danger laid himself down in the bed but he had scarcely been there two minutes when he felt acute pain through his whole system for the fine bottlepowder had gone through every pore of his body in european variants of the story the fairy prince is usually wounded by knives or razors set in the window through which he was wont to wing his way the story is almost identical with that of  the fan prince the twentyfifth of miss stokess indian fairy tales it is interesting to compare the story of the evil eye of sani no 6 with such western tales about bad luck as the sicilian story of sfurtuna pitre no 86 sani the god of bad luck once had a dispute with lakshmi the goddess of good luck as to which was the higher in rank the question was referred to a man named sribatsa who decided it in favour of lakshmi thereupon sani persecuted sribatsa for the space of three years in no 21  the field of bones the excellent ttory told so well in the vetala tales of the four young men learned but not vise who brought to life a tiger which proceeded to devour its imprudent resuscitators is narrated at considerable length but in such a manner as to render it pointless in no ll which records the adventures of two thieves there is an incident closely resembling part of the russian story of the miser who objected to repaying a kopeck which he had borrowed and who pretended to be dead in order to escape from his creditor the similarity is too great to be accounted for as an accidental coincidence no 9 which describes the origin of opium appears to be an imitation of a story well known in europe about  the origin of wine and the opening is copied from another familiar tale a sage transformed a rat several times until it became a queen named postomani or the poppyseed lady the queen eventually tumbled into a well and was drowned from her remains sprang a tree called after her pesto that is the poppy tree and from it opium was subsequently made those persons who partake of opium share the natures of the various beings into which the animal which finally became a queen was successively transformed becoming  mischievous like a rat fond of milk like a cat quarrelsome like a dog filthy like an ape savage like a boar and hightempered like a queen among the stories of a less familiar aspect may be mentioned some of those about ghosts no 14 may be taken as a specimen close to the house of a married brahman stood a tree  on the boughs of which lived a ghost of the kind called sankchinni this ghost one night seized the brahmans wife thrust her into a hole in the tree put on her clothes and took her place in the brahmans house for some time the substitution was not found out but one day the brahmans mother requested her supposed daughterinlaw to bring a vessel from some distance and the ghost unconsciously stretched her hand to several yards distance and brought it in a trice for indian ghosts it seems  can lengthen or shorten any limb of their bodies on another occasion the old lady on visiting the kitchen  found that her daughterinlaw was not using any fuel for cooking but had thrust into the oven her foot which was blazing brightly so an exorcist was sent for who lighted a piece of turmeric under the nose of the suspected wife now this was an infallible test as no ghost whether male or female can put up with the smell of burnt turmeric the result was that the ghost screamed aloud and fled the exorcist followed and began to belabour her with his slippers  then the ghost said with a strong nasal accentfor all ghosts speak through the nosethat she was a sankchinni and in fact confessed all her misdeeds the real wife was restored to her home and the ghost after having promised to do no more harm to the brahman or his family  was again shoebeaten and then dismissed no 15 contains the narrative of a ghost who behaved better an utterly indigent brahman induced by the promise of a large reward ventured to visit by night a tree which was the abode of a number of very irritable ghosts they were on the point of tearing him to pieoes when he was saved by the interference of a brahraadaitya the ghost of a brahman who had died unmarried moved by the brahmadaityas expostulations the other ghosts placed themselves at the service of the brahman and soon rendered him a rich man when his corn was ripe they

it the land of mzarcels folk tales from austria and bohemia by theodor verna leken with preface by e johnson sonnenschein what a man will go through nay what a man must go through when he has got a fine crafty fish at the end of his line which he means to land over boulders under trees through the flashing waters eager chasing patient waiting but what matters so long as victory crowns the fight and the hard won spoil lies panting on the green grass his silver armour glittering in the sunlight and it is just such another struggle that the folklore collector has while lie sits and angles with all his craft and daintiest bait some aged crone alongside the cottage fire failing memory meanders on through the days of youth and what folks did and said then lurking suspicion as to what  the man wants  sends the longed for tale hither and thither old memories of those who told these things in the bygone rise up like eddies in the babbling burn baffling and bewildering the eager sportsman but what matters all the toil and trouble if at last the longedfor tale is landed and laid in all its quaintness snug in the notebook weird and wonderful and all aglow with the light of other days patience and perseverance mingled with sympathy and cunning is needed before these old world relies can be secured every collection of folktales represents an amount of labour the world at large little dreams of and not labour only but often selfdenial of the highest kind as we see in such lives as that of the late elias lunrott to whose industry and hardihood we owe the ifalerala now things are somewhat changed universities do not think it waste of money to give grants to students that they may go and live nmong the people in order to collect the songs tales and superstitions that still linger among them even now men are engaged in this work on the shores of the baltic and we are told that thousands of songs and tales have been already gathered in if finland can do so why not england with all her wealth and power there is not a moment to waste for we all know how hard it is even now to squeeze the veriest morsel of folklore out of the country folks how they apologise for telling us such nonsense and emphatically declare their own disbelief in the whole thing and then what a ghostly simulacrum appearsthe flesh and blood yea and spirit gone and lo a handful of dry bones and it must be so it is one thing to hear a tale as it comes fresh from the lips of the peasant sitting by the great hearth on the winter nightwithout the wild wind roaring amid the sounding pines and howling like a demon pack around the house corner within no light but the wooden splints with their flickering flame playing on the faces of the family who sit half iraped in the gloomit is quite another to hear the same story told by those who mixing in the busy world have cast off all the old thoughts who hear no demons cry in the night wind nor think of poor souls in vain trying to rest on the housetop as they race on in wild unrest till the day of doom but who tap the barometer and regard all as the effects of the immutable laws of nature we cannot be too thankful to grimm asbjdrnsen castr n erdelyi and the numerous collectors who saved the tales when they were in some decgree alive for so soon as education and its various attendants enter the folklore domain the whole thing is clianged stories about men who were chopped into mincemeat upon three consecutive days and were no worse but rather the better for the process take flight old women who were changed into burning ovens finnish wolves who became shops full of the most precious goods and a man behind the counter sz6kely women who could become rivers with eight tributaries and mtagvar lads who turned into millet fields without the sniallet inconvenience and all the rest of the marvellous host disappear into thin air and their memory even is hid in dark places compare an ordinary fairy talc as told to our children with its variant as told amid the lapps anl the difference between a dead and a living folltale will soon be seen the one is stripped of most of its wonders anl what remains is watered down or apologised for while the other bristles with the wildest notionsa man becomes a magpie and no one is astonished a man drinks an inland sea dry and it is treated as a mere matter of course even the snow himself occasionally woos some fair girl by the fjord side  such tales at the first glance may appear mere nonsense and to collect them a waste of time but more careful consideration has shown such is not the case that there is method in their madness and that they are a by no means unimllortant factor in the history of early man thus it is we heartily welcome any new eolleetion of stories especially when it deals with districts of which we as yet know but little the collection before us we are told was faithfully taken down from word of mou1th by prof vernaleken from the people of lower austria and bohemia and is one which presents many points of great interest we find as usual the wonderful similarity that exists betwveen tales told in the mos4 distant places hondiddlelo and

red hunters and the animal people by charles a eastman ohiyesa harper 6s the author says the scene of the stories is laid in the great northwest the ancient home of the dakota or sioux nation my people and they are based upon the common experiences and observations of the red hunters eventhose incidents which are unusual and might appear incredible to the white man are actually current among the sioux and deemed worthy of belief the result ia one of the most original and delightful books about animal life that have appeared for a long time full of interest and information not to be found in textbooks few sketches of the kind could be more charming than that of wechah the racoon and his young indian mistress or more interesting than  the river people or again the mustering of the herds but it is difficult to make a choice where all have distinct claims to recognition each in its turn will be appreciated by lovers of animals and to young people will prove a mine of information and amusement the book is simply and pleasantly written with no affectation or mannerism but the frequent use of the word  dove  fer dived strikes oddly upon english ears though the author has longfellows sanction for it in  dove as if he were a beaver,folklore
myths and legends of the bantu by alice werner 15s harrap the anthropological journalist who wishes to present the result of his researches in the form which used to be known as  suitable for household reading is confronted with very great difficulties one cannot blame him for confining his reports to the scientific journals when the penalty for venturing outside their covers is to be listed in the booksellers catalogues under  curious if he is not a good story teller or if he is a stickler for exactitude he had better confine himself to the journal but if he is skilful enough to tell a story well within the prescribed limits then he must be encouraged to come out and tell it to us because a good story is always worth while the tragedy is that robbed of so much it will remain nothing more than a story where formerly it had held an importance amounting to an article of religion and its recital even an exposition of faith however the collector of these stories is a woman and she can tell them exceedingly well and her book strictly speaking does not pretend to be an anthropological study in answer to the question  who are the bantu  it may be instructive to quote dr werners reply that bantu is now the generally accepted name for those natives of south africa the great majority who are neither hottentots nor bushmenthat is to say mainly the zabus xosas thafins basuto and bechuanato whom may be added the thongas shangaans of the delagoa bay region and the people of southern rhodesia commonly though incorrectly called mashaud it will be seen that this list covers a great variety of racial types the tall stronglymade zulu differing vastly from the short and sturdy pokomo canoeman and the overtall and toothin men of the hereros from the small active and wiry anyanja of nyasaland so it is misleading to speak of a bantu race the remarkable and binding feature about these peoples is that their language possesses almost identically the same grammar differing no more than french does from spanish or english from danish where it originally came from and how it spread no one knows although conjecture has it that it came from somewhere in the region of the great lakes and spread towards the south and east about two or three thousand years ago the mass of the stories are what one may term ghost stories that is they concern themselves mwith the spirits of the dead this is not unnatural when the main feature of the religion consists of a cult of the dead and the belief in a high god if not entirely forgotten has become very vague the dead may return in the form of animals so animal stories are in a preponderance too among these we find the original characters of the  uncle remus  stories only it was not until the negroes reached the american slave plantations that brer rabbit took the place of the hare of an africa that knows no rabbit south of the sahara perhaps the strangest case of diffusion although dr werner generally disagrees with the diffusionist theory of fairystories is the case of sops fables the thirtyfirst chapter of the koran is called the chapter of lokmaan a great fabulist among the arabs and a man reputed to have known david he was a black manan ethiopian and it is supposed that he is no other than the 2esop of the greeks today he circulates again in the country of his origin translated back again into the vernacular along with the recent introductions of grimms fairy tales,folklore
polynesian mythology and ancient traditional history of the new zealand race as fur nished by their priests and chiefs london saturday march 10 1855 reviews by sir george grey late governorinchief of new zealand murray when the author of this curious volume arrived among the strange people whom it was his mission to govern and protect he found himself helpless and was wise enough to avow it he was governor of a land where the indomitable british lion had tougher work of it than that wonderful animal ever expected to rind governor grey was anxious to do his duty impartially by all his great difficulty lay in this that he could not communicate satisfactorily with the natives there was indeed no lack of interpreters to make intercourse easy between him and the petitioning or remonstrant aboriginals but the interpreters themselves were frequently at fault there was a language and there were legends and poetical fragments employed in the addresses of some of those who came to seek redress from the governor of which the most skilful interpreters could no more make sense than mr hamilton could of some of the greek choruses the talk about rights and wrongs land labour settlement and occupation was constantly perplexed by grave allusions to mythic periods of new zealand history by quotations of perfectly unintelligible proverbs and by snatches of poetical citations for the conclusions of which whereby alone sense could be made of the first half the governor had to seek among the people of the aptyawt ditrict though compilers who built up the  iliad and  odyssey out of the fragments sung by the rhapsodists had no such laborious task a9 that which governor grey undertook and achieved in mastering their difficult language nnd in gathering up the fragments of their ancient lore having subdued the rugged difficulties which lay in the way of his mastering the language the energetic governor made acquaintance with if we may so speak the aboriginal clerical gentlemen of the locality he did not as cardinal ximenes with the moorish hooks in spain wish to destroy all traces and history of the heathen paston the contrary he wished to preserve and draw profit from them he had not the feeling of dr cumming who in his finger of god so complacently congratulates the world on the destruction of the great alexandrian library if the first archbishop of mexico instead of burning all the pictorial records of anahuac had preserved them for future scholars to read and digest he perhaps would have given to the world some truths sacred and important and have thrown a light upon aztec paths along which the old messengers of truth may once nave walked we are then the more disposed to be grateful to governor grey for the arduous labour undergone it has by no means been without results of usefulness and amusement he has sat at the feet of tatooed gamaliels and learned a world of inconceivable nonsensebut nonsense in which there are such singular indications that it is but the corruption of the one and immutable truth as to at once give it importance and dignity from the lips of new zealand priests and cunning men he has gathered all the lore stored up in such garners the traditionary history of the land that  shall be great hereafter is stupendously absurd but as we have said there are indications wildly distorted that at some very remote period there was a better instruction than the natives have enjoyed until very recently when we read for instance of the fratricide tumatauenga we are reminded of him who first slew his brother the fact that it was god who first taught and enjoined prayer to man is also here confessed and when we learn of what wickedness  the disappearance of a great part of the dry land was the resultand how during the contest of opposing men  a great part of mother earth was submergedwe are reminded that even among these islanders the record of the dread visitation has not been altogether lost that with the preservation of the record a spirit of poetry has not been also lost the following passage will amply demonstrate  up to this time the vast heaven has still ever remained separated from his spouse the eurth yet their mutual love still continuesthe soft warm sighs of her loving bosom still ever rise up to him ascending from the woody mountains and valleys and men call these mists and the vast heaven as he mourns through the long nights his separation from his beloved drops frequent tears upon her bosom and men seeing these term them dewdrops governor greys book proves that scripture history is at the foundation of that of new zealand this is sometimes hard to discover but the fact appears not the less certain the details are dissimilar but the leading point of the stories is not to be mistakenas in the tale of the jealousy of the brothers of mauitikitikiotaranga wherein we recognise the muchenduring joseph the beauty of this lengthilynamed hero is described according to the prevailing taste of the locality and maidens are admiringly told of him thai the skin on his hips looked mottled and beautiful as that of a mackerel from the tatoomarks cut on it by the chisel of uetonga in these traditionary stories the old truth is perverted in more ways than one and not only are the deeds of old distorted in the telling but the acts of many are heaped upon one individual thus it is said of maui the joseph of the last story that but for a certain matter recounted in a very long and very prosy legend no more human beings would have died but death itself would have been destroyed but the story of joseph is more easily traceable in the legend of tawhaki of whom not his brothers indeed but his brothersinlaw were jealous and by these he was half slain and cast into a pit only to rise to more exalted greatness than ever in like manner we have the story of sarah and hagar in that of the jealousy of the wives of tinirau against the young stranger whom he took to himself as an additional wife few if any of the touching episodes of holy writ are traceable in these wild legends and though some of them describe characters that are not void of good qualities yet we do not find among them such men as isaac and ishmael who though foes and of opposite religious faiths yet became reconciled over the dead body of a father the traces of classical and romantic stories are equally to be discovered amid the debris of this legendary history we see the god and the bayadere with a difference in the story of tawhaki and the divine girl tangotango one of the labours of hercules is traditionally preserved in the cleaning of the courtyard of rehua by the indefatigable rupe we know how classical tradition tells us that the milky way is but the stain from the fallen bowl when hebe lay a lapse of loveliness along the skies so here we find a certain kaitangata bleeding  and his blood running about over part of the heavens stained them and formed what we now call a ruddiness in the sky when therefore a red and ruddy tinge is seen in the heavens men say ah kaitangata stained the heavens with his blood if lesbos had its arion who rode the dolphin as skilfully as mr waterton did the cayman so does new zealand boast of its magician kae who stemmed the waves on the back of the gentlest of whales we may notice that in the distortion of stories which we believe ourselves to have more carefully preserved the parts and persons are often exchanged in our edition of hero and leander it was the lover who from before him put the parting waves and it was hy though window a sweet maiden sat grave with glad thoughts the antipodean minstrels tell the tale the other way and it is the fair girl hinemoa who dashes into the waves and crosses the boisterous strait as soon as her ear is struck by the soft measures from the horn of tutanekai hinemoa too has a way about her that strongly reminds us of that galatea whom dryden by the way has converted into a phyllis who pelted damaetas with apples and then hid herself among the willows with a strong desire of being found out  and hinemoa knew the voice that the sound of it was that of the beloved of her heart and she hid herself under the overhanging rocks of the hotspring but her hiding was hardly a real hiding but rather a bashful concealing of herself from tutanekai that he might not find her at once but only after trouble and careful searching for her so he went feeling about along the banks of the hotspring searching everywhere whilst she lay coyly hid under the ledges of the rock peeping out wondering when she would be found at last he caught hold of a hand and cried out hollo whos this  and hinemoa answered  its i tutanekai and he said but who are you whos i then she spoke louder and said  its i tis hinemoa and he said  ho  ho ho can such in very truth be the case  let us two go then to my house and she answered yes and she rose up in the water as beautiful as the wild white hawk and stepped upon the edge of the bath as graceful as the shy white crane and he threw garments over her and took her and they proceeded to his house ami reposed there and thenceforth according to the ancient laws of the maori they were man and wile anadyomene rising from the sea hardly looks more graceful than hinemoa the shy white crane upon the brink of the bath the galateas of the new zealand pastorals have it should be noticed their minerva to teach them the handiwork most useful to them thus kahukura learned the art of netting from the fairies but the pupil was not so proud as arachuc the dyers daughter of colopher who thought herself more nimble at the needle than the very goddess of the art there are no really comic legends among the traditionary stories of our new zealand brethren there is one piece of wit however at which they have never done laughing and they cannot hear it too often it consists of hearing a chief spoken of as being mistaken for a slave and asked to carry wood or perform other servile offices when this incident occurs then do they represent laughter holding both his sides their risibility at such an idea is inextinguishable diggory did not laugh half so willingly for twenty years at mr hardcastles daily story of old grouse in the gunroom as the new zealanders do at the bare and ticklish idea of a chief being asked to work or being spoken of as so employed the fact is as much out of the common order of things e with them as would be with us the sight of a prince consort posting bills in the strand or acting as conductor to an omnibus we conclude with a citation which will serve to 9how of what soft material and pleasant complexions fairies are composed in new zealand it is only necessary to premise that the hero and his friends had unconsciously intruded upon hallowed ground  te kanawa a chief of waikato was the man who fell in with a troop of fairies upon the top of pukemore a high hill in the waikato district this chief happened one day to go out to catch kiwis wih his dogs and when night came on he found himself right at the top of pukemore so his party made a tyre to give them light for it was very dark they had chosen a tree to sleep under a very large tree the only one tit for their purpose that they could timi  in fact it was a very convenient sleepingplace for the tree had immense routs sticking up high above the ground they slept beuveen these roots and made the fire beyond them as soon as it was dark they heard loud voices like the voices of people coming that way there were the voices of men ot women and of childien as if a very larc party of people were coming along tiley looked for a long time but could see nothing  till at last te kanawa knew the j noise must proceed from fail iej his people were all dreadfully frightened and would ha vu run away j if they could  hut where could they run to for they  were in the midst of a forest on the top of a lonely mountain and it was dark night for a long time the voices grew louder and more distinct as the fairies  drew nearer and nearer until they came quite close to the fire  te kanawa and his patty were half dead with fright at at tlu fairies approached to look at te kanawa who was a very handsome fellow to do this they kept peeping slily over the large rools of the tree under which the hunters were wing and kept constantly looking at te kanawa whilst his companions were quite insensible from fear whenever the lire blazed up brightly off went the fairies ard hid themselves peeping out from behind stumps and trees  and when it burnt low back they came close to it merrily singing as they moved hero you come dimbiir over mount tirang to vitit the handsome chief of ngupuhi whom we have done with a sudden thought struck te kanawa that he might induce them to go away if he gave them all the jewels he had about him  so he took off a beautiful little figure carved in green jasper which he wore as a neck ornament and a precious carved jasper eardrop from his ear ah te kanawa was only trying to amuse and please them to save his life but all the time he was nearly frightened to death however the fairies did not rush on the men to attack them but only came quite close to look at them as soon as te kanawa had taken off his neck ornament and pulled out his jasper earring and his other earring made of a tooth of the tigershark he spread them out before the fairies and offered them to the multitude who were sitting all round about the place  and thinking it better the fairies should not touch him he took a stick and fixing it into the ground hung his neck ornament and earrings upon it as soon as the fairies had ended their song they took the shadows of the earrings and handed them about from one to the other until they had passed through the whole party which then suddenly disappeared and nothing more was seen of them the fairies carried ott with them the shadows of all the jewels of te kanawa but they let behind them his jasper neck ornament and his earrings so that he took them back again the hearts of the fairies being quite contented at getting the shadows alone they saw also that te kanawa was an honest welldispositioned fellow however the next morning as soon as it was light he got down the mountain as fast as he could without stopping to hunt longer for kiwis this is a real connaught legend and we cite it as one more proof of a common origin of traditionary story and therewith we commit governor greys book to the public,folklore

traditions of lancashire second series by j roby mral 2 vols 8vo rich indeed in legendary lore is the county of lancashire and well for her traditions is it that they have fallen into such able hands as those of mr roby to a thorough knowledge of antiquarian learning he unites a brilliant imagination and is thus enabled to throw over the pile of hoar antiquity the light which renders the ruin so beautiful and attractive with the wand of the magician he stays the rapidly departing shadows  more than this he imparts a new substance and reality to them and gives relief and prominence to things but dimly seen  he rescues  the relics of the past from the oblivion to which they were hastening and by a rare union of the antique and the modern he illustrates manners and customs now obsolete by tales that however bearing upon tradition have still a distinct and separate interest to recommend them if his imagination is tempted to overstep her limits the severity of the antiquary restrains her flight and thus the keeping is perfect the style of the work is another of its excellencieswhether of humour or of pathoswhether of love or terrorwhether in the whirlwind of passion or in ladys bower in the conflict of the elements or in the placid lakenature in her summer beauty or the howling of the winters stormmr roby has appropriate language for each and all nor is it the least of his merits that in every tale there is a fine moral tone and a moral purpose while the impress of a pious mind is visibly stamped upon the whole it is true that we are constantly reminded of sir walter scott and this has been supposed to detract from the originality of mr robys work we do not think so for it is not in parallel passages or in characters for which we could find a prototype in the author of waverley  but we find ourselves perpetually saying  this is in scotts manner meaning that if scott had chosen the subject he would thus have treated it and this we consider as very high praise having thus briefly offered our opinion of the general merits of mr robys volumes we proceed to give extacts which will justify our praise premising that in tales none of which are of any length it is difficult to discover passages which can afford a fair specimen of mr robys manner the following describes the person of that young pretender to the crown of england in the reign of henry the seventh by some historians said to be lambert simnel and by others the unfortunate earl of warwick it was at the peel or castle of fouldrey that his mimic and motley court was first held before a long narrow table near the bed and on a highbacked oaken chair sat the young pretender he was dressed in a richly embroidered gown the sleeves wide and hanging down from the wrists like lappets on his head was a low cap surmounted by long waving feathers and his manners and appearance were not devoid of grace and gentility he displayed considerable selfpossession and wore his kingly honours with great assurance he was of a fair and sanguine complexion pale rather than clear and his hair clustered in heavy ringlets on his shoulders a rapid and somewhat uncertain motion of the eye and his mouth not weil closed showed that although he might have been schooled to the exhibition and could wear the outward show of firmness and decision yet in the hour of emergency and in the day of trial his fortitude would in all likelihood forsake him then we have portraits of his followers  at his right hand eat the priest in a white cassock and scapulary a black hood thrown back upon his shoulders exhibited the form and dismsition of his head to great advantage his features were large expressive and commanding the fire of a brilliant grey eye was scarcely tempered by his overhanging brows though at times the spirit seemed to retire behind their grim shadows to survey more securely and unobservedly the aspect and appearances without  swartz the flemish general a blunt military chieftain was at his side a black bushy beard some inches in advance of his honest goodhumoured face was placed in strong contrast with the wary pale and somewhat dubious aspect of the priest  kildare the irish deputy and lovel with several of the senior officers and captains were assembled round the table  the room was lofty lighted by a small pointed window and contained the luxury of a fireplace in which lay some blazing embers  a grateful and refreshing sight in that chill and ungenial atmosphere by the artifices of margaret duchess of burgundy a mysterious personage of gigantic stature appears and directs the councils of the rebels and is by them supposed to be supernatural this fact comes to the knowledge of the abbot of furness a loyal adherent of henryby dispatches intercepted by a halfwitted fellow dick empson and an attempt is made to turn this information to account and to induce tiie rebels to quit the castle of mr robys talent for the ludicrous not unmixed with the terrible we could not mention a better specimen than the tale entitled  the dule upo dun but we must refer our readers to the volumes where they will find much that is curious and all entertaining we will not repeat our praise of the work  we hope soon to find mr roby employed with equal talent on the traditions of other counties assured that so diligent a reaper will gather an abundant harvest wherever he shall put in his sickle his defence of tradition against the charges of the historian in the introduction to this series is a learned and clever dissertation,folklore
the tragedy of the norse gods by rviii j pitt illustrated by g p jacombhood and j a j brindley 6s unwin with the translations of dasent and laing and morris as good and faithful as they are it is always doubtful whether a concentrated version of the stories in the eddas or the sagas will be accounted satisfactory yet with stories so good and translations so little accessible it is always tempting to try ones hand at such a version the chief danger of telling such tales nowadays is not a literary one for good straightforward modern english is infinitely preferable to unskilful attempts at archaic and poetic form the danger lies in the infusion of modernsentiments and thoughts into tales that can never be interpreted by these miss pitt has not altogether escaped this danger she owns to occasional expansion for the sake of prettidne and she has made the pathos a little more obtrusive than it should be in these heroic tales yet she is filled with admiration and love for the stories and admiration and love are catching and she has enough learning to make her a good guide on the first part of the way say to within sight of bifrost regarded merely as a storybook and perhaps that was her whole intention her book is excellent from the tragedy of the nona gods se lo,folklore

hero tales and leaends of the serbian by woislav m petrovitch harrap  co 10 6d net during the late balkan wars servia surprised her friends and foes alike by her military exploits today she is surprising them still further and the gallant fight she is making against austriahungary has won for her many new friends and admirers in this country the publication of mr petrovitchs book comes therefore at an opportune moment it is pleasant to be able to add that it is well worth attention for its own sake the first part is given up to tales of the national heroes who flourished before the coming of the turk or at least before he had planted his foot firmly on the country  kralyevitch marko or prince marko of prilip tsar doushan tsar lazar banovitch strahinya and others these tales have been selected from the third edition of vouk stephanovitch karadgitchs great collection of the national ballads and translated by the author and though he more than once laments his inability to set them before us in metrical form they are even in their present dress decidedly attractive indeed comparing mr petrovitchs translations with the metrical versions of sir john bowlingof which three specimens are includedwe must confess to a preference for the former a score of representative folktales follow the tales of the heroes and finally we have some servian popular anecdotes which show here and there a pretty wit the folktales are for the greater part strongly reminiscent of those of a similar class in other countries but they are by no means lacking in interest moreover we find in them striking traces of contact with the turk and through him with the arab yet it must not be thought that they have no originality or character of their own there is about them a sturdy morality which characterises the hero tales also that is certainly not oriental and here and there they strike a note of tragedy that is rare in our own tales of a similar class amongst the heroes kralyevitch marko naturally takes first place he is something more than the national hero servians regard him as the personification of the national character if we adopt that view we must certainly esteem the national character for marko with all his faults was a gallant knight indeed it is interesting to learn that helike several other national heroes and saints is not dead but sleeping with his great sword plunged to the hilt in the rock beside him ready to serve his country when necessary4fc to reestablish the mediaeval empire lost at the battle of kossovo a footnote tells us how he actually did appear during the late war and led the servian troops to victory against the turks the information necessary to a proper enjoyment of the tales is given in the introduction and the first three chapters these contain a brief history of the servians since they emigrated from galicia and many particulars of national customs and superstitions  and readers may well find this the most interesting part of the book especially at the present time here is the authors estimate of his countrymen  44 the average serbian has a rather lively temperament he is highly sensitive and very emotional his enthusiasm is quickly roused but mast emotions with him are as a rule of short duration however he is extremely active and sometimes persistent truly patriotic he is always ready to sacrifice his life and property for national interests which he understands particularly well thanks to his intimate knowledge of the ancient history of his people transmitted to him from generation to generation through the pleasing medium of popular epic poetry composed in von simple decasyllabic verseentirely serbian in its origin ho is extremely courageous and always ready for war although patriarchal and conservative in everything national he is ready and willing to accept new ideas very submissive in his zadrooga and obedient to his superiors he is often despotic when elevated to power the history of all the southern slavs pictures a series of violations depositions political upheavals achieved sometimes by the most cruel means and acts of treachery  all mainly due to the innate and hitherto inexpugnable faults characteristic of the race such as jealousy and an inordinate desire for power such frankness wins our respect when mr petrovitch tells us boldly that 44 the worship of naturehas not even to our day vanished from the popular creed of the balkans we feel safe in trusting ourselves to his guidance the balkans are generally so extremely anxious to prove themselves quite abreast of if not a little ahead of the times that they are apt to become tiresome there is no reason why they should seek to ape the west in all things or why they should be ashamed to confess that all their old beliefs and 44 superstitions  are not dead yet the belief in vampires seems to have originated in this part of europe unfortunately mr petrovitch tells us little about them we should like to know more how for instance does  the black horse without blemish help to discover the grave in which the vampire is  as to our old friend the dragon the servians know that the form in which he was always depicted for us and is actually depicted by one of mr petrovitchs illustrators is 44 merely used as a misleading mask   44 in his true character a dragon is a handsome youth possessing superhuman strength and courage and ho is usually represented as in love with some beautiful princess or empress evidently he is a refined monster it may be noted indeed that these servian stories tales of the peasants though they be commonly showa refinement and delicacy of feeling that are surprising in this respect they resemble the turkish tales but not of course the arab another pleasing feature is the real love of animals which they reveal marko himself shares his glory as he regularly shared his red wine with 44 sharatz his marvellous piebald charger banovitch strahinya owes his life to his faithful greyhound caraman  and instances of birds and beasts befriending human beings are numerous the reese the servian nymphs are not nearly so attractive as our own queen mab and her followers 44 they believed in god and st john and abhorred the turk but 4 they could be very cruel   they had an unpleasant way of foretelling the death of heroes and others  and they were given to destroying buildingsor rather to preventing their completion unless the builders offered up a human sacrifice it would be interesting by the way to learn where the superstition about offering up a human sacrifice to ensure the stability of a building had its origin and at what period of the worlds history it was clearly widespread for tales founded upon it are current in many parts of the near and middle east the authors descriptions of servian customs and ceremonies observed on various festivals and feast days are noteworthy and his comments are apt many of the customs are as picturesque as they are quaint and it is to be hoped that they will not entirely disappear mr petrovitch is perhaps inclined to be unfair to the turk at times as for instance when he talks of the monks  inviolable within the sacred walls of their monasteries being the only scribes and authors left under the 4 blighting domination of the turk   and forgets that the very existence of the monks and their  sacred walls  argues tolerance on the part of the turk the illustrations are for the most part good and the book is well printed though mistakes in spelling are rather numerous we are glad to see a useful map and index,folklore
old rabbit the voodoo and other sorcerers by mary alicia owen fisher unwin  brother what a great deal of tea you do drink said the sister while handing him his fourteenth cup of weak tea  sister what a great deal of water you make mo drink in order to get a little tea  was his answer and it comes to our mind while reading this collection of stories it has mr leland says in the preface not been  made on the grimm principle of  pleasing tales for the nursery it is startling to hear that the brothers grimm had the nursery in their minds when they set the stone of collecting folktales rolling but it is manifest that miss owen cannot have had it in hers for except in an american not to say a missourinursery her book will be almost unintelligible some words are obscure even to grownup people and it is hard to have to toil through so much negroenglish before we can enjoy the items of true folklore earnest clear and welldefined that are promised by mr leland the promise is fulfilled there is a great deal of valuable folklore in the stories but it is injured not only by the uncouth dialect but by being laboriously introduced into the conversation of five negresses and one child who draws thenout one negress is from ole feginney another was bornded in tennisee but mosly brung up in mizzoury  a third has a french father a fourth a fox indian while the fifth aunt mymee is spoken of as the only pureblooded african of the group an african sorceress is indeed her mother but she is anxious to have it generally understood that her other parent was the devil she is acquainted with the mysteries of voodooism and can trick men and beasts and to trick in negroenglish means more than in english proper she lays  a turrble trick  on some dogs but explains that it is one which is mostly used on human beings  wut trick  asked grannydes just one o dem oby pison yo kyarn git all de greegins ingredients foh hit hyeah so i dont mek no bones ter tell yo dat hit am er powdeh mek outen de

histoire des treize and there is an admirable description of his death by slow torture in the manner indicated by aunt mymee whose form of dialect is happily simpler than that of her associates miss owen who has we are told been initiated sufficiently into the mysteries of voodooism to divine its full scope and nature means to give her knowledge to the world at some future time that being the case she does not give so much of it now as we should like but what she does give is most interesting aunt mymee has a luckball which she believes contains her soul as well as her luck she calls it by her own name and bathes it in whiskey once a week to preserve its strength full directions are given for the making wearing and treatment of a luckball it is a thing or a being which  busts loose  if not properly treated and may be taken out and consulted his or her  approval or disapproval can always be felt dy the owner at once and help relied on if asked for the negroes seem to have a large number of superstitions in common with us the snake superstitions are of course their own and are curious one is that if you kill the first snake you see you are safe from all other snakes for the rest of your life we tell the bees if a death occurs in the family so do they but they tell the births and weddings too there are a great many northcountry words in their dialect one of the most unexpected is bijitty conceited   bigoted or even  bigitive  is used in the north in just the same sense yarbs is found in yorkshire so is traipsing also heard in london and many other instances might be given dumb for stupid in the recipe for obi poison is of course german and is not to give  a tongue thrashing  irish   old rabbit the voodoo and other sorcerers by mary alicia owen fisher unwin this quaint volume is from the pen of the southern lady whose paper on  missourinegro folklore was one of the good things at the folklore congress of 1891 she now appears in the guise of the flaxenhaired listener irreverently dubbed towhead for whose benefit a remarkable group of black women pour out their treasures of ancient fable the form and method of the book recall of course uncle pe mus but the likeness stops there considered as humorous literature old rabbit cannot perhaps rank with the masterpiece of  joel chandler harris   but from the point of view of the folklorist it has a far higher value both are collections of  animal myths founded on widespread and immemorial traditions with many modern glosses derived from misunderstood phenomena and adorned with detail varying with the different races by whom they have been handed down but whereas uncle remus is saturated with the modern plantation nigger in miss owens book the bed indian medicine man is predominant and there is also a considerable tincture of the aboriginal african witchdoctor the stories here set down for us come from the missouri border where there is a large black population of mixed indian and negro blood a blend which not only has an individual flavour of its own but seems to have preserved certain voodoo elements not generally met with in the states about voodooism we know comparatively little but no doubt as mr leland tells us in his preface it is distinguished from aryan and also from red indian magic by its reliance not so much on penance and invocation as  on daring what is horrible and repulsive the discrimination of these different elements in miss owens stories is an engaging task for the reader who will also notice the considerable literary skill she shows both in the telling of the stories and in the portraits of those who tell them a the voodoo king if a slightly revolting and simian personage is typical and the black sibyls who foregather in the cottage of granny are admirably distinct in character speech and appearance chief of them is granny herself devoted to  the folks at the house whose slave she once was who claims to be a descendant of   them injuns dat hilt de kyentry fo de white folks come dar  a pedigree generally admitted notwithstanding her crisp white wool and pronounced negro appearance next is big angy or mrs boogarry whose fulldress name is madame angelique bougareau a double cross of indian negro and creolea fervent catholio and firm believer in heathen witchcraft with the nose of an eagle the eye of a hawk the mouth of a cat and hair like the tail of a black horse she swears in french and allows her worthless husband to gamble away her small earnings explaining her want of thrift by saying  me daddy was a great french hunter and me mammy was chile tu de big chief of de iowas dey no put by lak the squirl in de hole then there is the fat and jolly aunt emly with her high indian cheek bones and oily black ringlets  and aunt my mee the nurse  the only pureblooded african and the only coppercoloured person in the party the child of a guinea sorceress she would fain have her friends believe that she had the devil for a father and was so far successful that not one of them ever went to bed without pouring a cup of seeds on the doorstep and hearth lest in the night mymee should arrive by the threshold or the chimney and ride on their chests tie their hair in knots or perform somo of the other pleasantries for which your witch in all countries is famous a pleasing foil to these old negresses is tow head herself the little white girl whom they combine to spoil and petpositive and perverse and a passionate lover of the witch story some of her own sayings are in the happiest vein as when after hearing though nigger version of aesops fox who through his braggart humour fell a victim to the hounds  all except de bresh she bursts out with 441 hate a story that kills somebody and i know how foxies lations felt for some hunters came by here you know and their dogs killed my kitten i cried awfully and heard grandma say to mamma that i seemed to feel that i had lost a lation i didnt really for i have so many lations and only had just that one sweet kitty there is a whole series of rabbit stories usually funny though containing nothing quite equal to the tarbaby episode in which uncle remuss chartered libertine so nearly gets his  comeuppence we would call particular attention to this among other new and delightful words by which the blacks vocabulary is richer than the whites the rabbit with miss owen is much more of a magician much less an incarnation of the nigger than with  joel chandler harris  and a similar distinction is noticeable between the bird and reptile personages in the two collections chief among the birds is of course the woodpecker who was a very early bird at magical work for did not picus martius take romulus and remus from the month the umbrian augurs knew him well and in the eugubine tables we find the directions parfa kurnase dersua peiqu peica merstu by interpretation of prof donaldson  parram cornicem dextras picum picam simistros and it is noticeable that it is about these same birds that miss owens clients have most to tell us her woodpecker is however a far greater personage than the classical picus the king turned into a bird because he declined to serve a witchs sensual phantasy he is lord of the woods the greatest of all the magicians he makes the bat out of a mouse and a goatsucker and gives the redbird his gay plumage and endows his friends with all the good fortune and all the moral excellences that pallas and hera offered to paris perhaps this redheaded bird with his weird laughing cry the peculiar mimicry of his plumage and his curious exploratory methods of feeding is to be identified with the redcap goblins found all over europe but there is a vast difference between the treasureseeking folletto coila beretta of europe and the great sorcerer of the american continent perhaps the most curious passage in old rabbit is that in which the authoress describes the manufacture of a luckball price one dollar for the benefit of mr leland himself it is compounded of red clover substituted for the hair of the propositus dust white yarn sewing silk and tinfoil the whole tied in innumerable knots and plentifully moistened with libations of whiskey from the mouth of the voodoo king the knots are of the essence of the contract being four times four times four circe turned round four times according

science hausa folklore customs proverbs dbe collected and transliterated with english translation and notes by r sutherland rattray with a preface by r r marett 2 vols oxford clarendon press the foundation of this valuable work is a voluminous manuscript prepared at the request of mr rattray by shaihu a malani or learned scribe of the hausa people northern nigeria the liberality of the government of the gold coast in granting a subvention for the present publication has enabled what is virtually a facsimile of a selection from the ms in arabic characters to be given and to this mr rattray has added a transliteration into roman text a translation into english and many critical and grammatical notes the work is divided into five parts  the first a short history purporting to give the origin of the hausa nation and the story of their conversion to the mohammedan religion in which we find as might be expected a mixture of a mythological element with traditions of historical fact tracing the origin of the people of hausa land from the district of bornu bordering on lake chad the second part contains twentyone stories in which people are the heroes and heroines each story begins with the formula   this is a story about people or about a bushburning or an alliance or a certain chief or as the case may be a tale a tale let it go let it come and ends with the formula  off with the rats head which is explained by mr rattray to mean that the story is ended the rats head ls off that is the end of him it sometimes takes the expanded form of 44 the rat will not eat my head rather shall i eat his head the son of a worthless fellow the third part contains nine animal stories as of a hyena whose singing so pleased a lion and leopard that they left off fighting and danced away another hyena who had swallowed a girl and being torn in two by a lion disgorged her a third who was thrown by a lizard when the larger animals had failed to throw him  a hegoat a beetle  a spider and crows some of them point a moral as that evil longing and evil greed are not beautiful in others the moral is left to be inferred as where a beetle and a lion entered into an alliance to procure food   that was the origin of what you do now if you want to get food when you feel hungry for you join with some powerful person first then you get it the fourth part describes the customs and arts of the hausa in marriage an old woman is employed to present gifts from the suitor to the parents of the girl and when they are satisfied the courtship begins the bride is prepared for marriage by putting on henna whereupon she and her sisters weep copiously it is the custom for them to do so  they do  not do so because they want to while the bride proceeds quietly to her husbands house a substitute bride is brought there on horseback the marriage feast is held four days afterwards and completes the ceremony the rubbing with henna is also practised on the bridegroom before the arrival of the bride twelve years is considered to be the proper marriageable age for a girl on the naming of a child a ram is slaughtered and the flesh divided and given as alms circumcision is practised on boys of ten years old and clitoridectomy on girls before the burial of the dead much ceremonial washing and in some cases anointing have to be performed the section relating to the arts contains the description of brasscasting by the cireperdue process which has been already communicated to the anthropological institute from mr rattrays ms by mr henry balfour journal rai xl 525 as taken down from the lips of ali the artist the fifth part which is a collection of 133 proverbs was written by a different hand it defines a proverb not unhappily as  words which are taken and jumbled up that a man may not know their meaning some of them may be cited as specimens  the nose does not know the flavour of the salt    the cat is not at home because of that the mice are playing    terror is a thing of the wilds shame of the abode of men   44 live patiently in the world know that those who hate you are more numerous than they who love you   he who goes surety is the one who has to pay   and the like mostly of a pessimistic type mr rattrays notes are largely grammatical he finds in the ms the use of a definite article though canon robinson in his 4 hausa grammar had said  there is no article in hausa   also of a present participle though another authority had said  there is no present participle in hausa   and in other respects shows how unwise it is to attempt to prove a negative the reader in social anthropology in the university of oxford who is also president of the folklore society contributes a preface in which he expresses approval of the method pursued by mr rattray of obtaining a ms version of the folktales and customs from a competent native a method which is practicable only where the community is so far advanced in civilization as to have an educated and literary class among it he further points out the value of the ms as here reproduced not only to officials who have to deal with native scribes but also to an educated hausa who may wish to learn english collections of hausa folktales have already been published by major tremearne and others and much literature exists on the subject of hausa culture but for the reasons given mr rattrays work has a definite value of its own we must not omit to note the ornamental designs with which the scribe has embellished his manuscript,folklore

she had often played before and xvent out into the wood and in the middle of the wood there xvas a bright cool brook and by the side of this she sat herself doxvn threxv the ball up into the air and caught it again  and this xvas to her as a pastime but it happened once xvhen the ball had floxxn very high and the princess lifted up her arm and stretched out her lingers that she might catch it that the ball fell upon the ground by the side of her and rolled staightxvays into the xvater the princess xvas frightened and looked after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy jewels thy pearls even thy golden crown itself are nothing to me  but if thou wilt take me for thy friend and companion set me on  we have not ottered an opinion on that part ol mr bulwers work which treats ol literature haviptt reserved hi views on thc subject sui a second notice thy right hand at thy little tallie j let nie eat with thee out of thy little golden dish drink with thee out of thy little cup and sleep in thy little bed i will get thee thy golden ball again how the princess thought in her heart  how this silly frog prattles  a frog is no companion for such as me hut must remain in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all her might j against it saying  now you xviii have rest enough you ugly frog  but xvhat fell on the hoot xvas not a dead frog but a living young prince xvho looked upon her xvith loving and friendly eyes and he became hy right and her fathers commands her loving

we like the flight to be high vast profound and wonderful all this we find in thc little volume before us so much do we revel in the marvellous of these tales that we really begrudge mr thoms the space that he occupies with his very erudite comparisons and analogies between the various fairy tales of all nations the more especially as these fictions must be nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear out of the chapter of curses so

the myths of the north american indians redskin tales by louis spence frai illustrated george g harrap and co 7s 6d net a collection of stories told by north american indians is here presented mr spence does not inform us how he became possessed of them but one is inclined to think that they have been gathered by him from the books which appear in the bibliography at the end of the present volume these sources differ very much in their value as evidence s e they range from the uncritical histories and travels of writers like adair and the bartrams in the eighteenth century through the interminable works of bancroft and catlin in the next down to the modern and more scientific collections of brinton curtin and boas and the acta of the smithsonian institute and of the many transatlantic anthropological societies the tales are here brought together without references to their origin or mode of selection save that they are arranged under the names of the various tribes or nations such as algonquins iroquois sioux and pawnees the stories thus chosen do not give us a very high idea of the red indian imagination hardly any of them are myths in the sense in which max muller used the word although in the case of hiawatha to which mr spence devotes a page or two he follows mr horatio hale in declaring that the whole story has grown up by disease of language round the history ot a real chief whose name happened to signify  he who seeks the wampum belt most of them are totem tales plainly invented ex post facto to explain why different tribes families or individuals came to be called by the names of animals a very few rise a little above this level as in the socalled cherokee tale of the origin of medicine where the animals once the friends of mankind grow angry at being hunted for food and call down diverse diseases on man who is only saved by the plants overhearing the plot and agreeing that each of them shall furnish a remedy for one of the diseases named the great majority however are merely wondertales in which magic power is ascribed to man and the lower animals alike and which mainly differ from the fairytales of our infancy by their pointlessness and incoherence a fair instance of this is the iroquois story of the stone giantess who settled herself in the wigwam of a hunter so as to escape from her cruel husband after a time the stone giant came in search of her when the hunter by her instructions struck him first on the arms and then on the nape of the neck killing him when the time comes for the hunter to return to his village the stone giantess also returns to her own people with the remark that now she has nothing to fear one would feel greater interest in these stories if one could be convinced of their originality so far is this from being the case that many of them seem to owe a good deal to wellknown european asiatic or african sources the sioux story of the beloved son who cannot return from the submarine land of the shades because he has eaten of food there is too strongly reminiscent of persephone and the pomegranate seed for the change of sex and locality to throw us off the scent so too in another sioux tale the exalting of the rabbit into an animal of extreme intelligence and cunning seems to smack of the negro stories enshrined in uncle remus and another attributed to the same tribe of a horse who warns his master of his brotherinlaws plot against his life is quite as near to the egyptian tale of two brothers as that of joseph and potiphars wife which most biblical critics now assign to that source the swanmaidens whose feather dresses are stolen by the hero are found here as in the norse literature and the arabian nights as is the lohengrin legend of the magic bark drawn by swans some of these parallels seem to have struck mr spence himself as when he draws the readers attention to the harrying of hades read harrowing of hell and declares that the algonquin tale of the crowwoman and the wolf bears a striking resemblance to spensers una and the lion if the tales given in this book have any connecting or distinctive thread it is the belief which appears in most of them in a land above the sky inhabited by spirits or supernatural beings resembling men who take an interest not always benevolent in the affairs of their mortal counterparts here again one would like to know if there is any trace of such a belief existing before the visit of the christian missionaries mr spences book is prettily illustrated by coloured plates of considerable artistic merit and is equipped with an introduction in which he deals with the origin of the north american indians he is we fancy right in implying that man is not indigenous to the american continent but came there from asia by a landbridge now submerged his identification of the modern esquimaux first with the earliest inhabitants and then with the skraelings of the norse sagas is more open to question but may pass muster we can hardly agree with him however when he tells us ex cathedra and without authority quoted that the fetish is in short a mascota luckbringer and that the mythologies of the red man are infinitely more rich in creative read creation and deluge myths than those of any other race in the two hemispheres we wonder whether he has ever heard of the sumerian cosmogonies whence perhaps all later ones have sprung,folklore

benefit of juvenile readers   thc frog king  or iron henrythere xvas once a young princess and for a long xvhile she knew not xvhat to do to amuse herself at last she took a golden ball xvith xvhich she had often played before and xvent out into the wood and in the middle of the wood there xvas a bright cool brook and by the side of this she sat herself doxvn threxv the ball up into the air and caught it again  and this xvas to her as a pastime but it happened once xvhen the ball had floxxn very high and the princess lifted up her arm and stretched out her lingers that she might catch it that the ball fell upon the ground by the side of her and rolled staightxvays into the xvater the princess xvas frightened and looked after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy jewels thy pearls even thy golden crown itself are nothing to me  but if thou wilt take me for thy friend and companion set me on  we have not ottered an opinion on that part ol mr bulwers work which treats ol literature haviptt reserved hi views on thc subject sui a second notice thy right hand at thy little tallie j let nie eat with thee out of thy little golden dish drink with thee out of thy little cup and sleep in thy little bed i will get thee thy golden ball again how the princess thought in her heart  how this silly frog prattles  a frog is no companion for such as me hut must remain in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all her might j against it saying  now you xviii have rest enough you ugly frog  but xvhat fell on the hoot xvas not a dead frog but a living young prince xvho looked upon her xvith loving and friendly eyes and he became hy right and her fathers commands her loving associate and husband and both xvere happy at the change and on thc following morning as soon as the sun awakened them there caine a handsome carriage drawn by eight white horses xvho xvere decorated with leathers and diemil in harness of gt dd  and behind the carriage stood  the servant of the young prince and he was the faithful henry the faithful henry had so mourned xvhen his master xvas transformed into a frog that he xvas obliged to put three iron bauds round his heart lest it should break for very grief and misery noxv the carriage was to bear the young prince home to his own kingdom so faithful henry handed iu his master and the young princess and got up behind it awaiti full of joy at his deliverance j and xvhen they had ridden a little xvay thc j prince heard something

characteristic of the country which gave them birth we really think that of all the preceding numbers we like this the best when we give up the reins of our judgement to the fancy of our entertainer we like the flight to be high vast profound and wonderful all this we find in thc little volume before us so much do we revel in the marvellous of these tales that we really begrudge mr thoms the space that he occupies with his very erudite comparisons and analogies between the various fairy tales of all nations the more especially as these fictions must be nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear out of the chapter of curses so

pawnee hero stories and folk  tales with notes on the origin customs and character of the pawnee people by g b grinnell to which is added a chapter on the pawnee language by john b dunbar nutt  blackfoot lodge tales the story of a prairie people by g b grinnell same publisher tne pawnee tribe ocaupied the banks of the platte river in nebraska where now stands the flourishing city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has several woodcut illustrations,folklore
twilight land by howard pyle illustrated osgood if you want to tell a fairy tale there are two generally recognised ways of doing itto give a more or less literal version of an old one or to let your own imagination loose in the composition of something more or less new mr pile has found a betwixt and between method it is as if after a thorough education in traditional fairy literature he had slept and dreamed for many nights and his dreams had been made alive by the persons and the adventures of all the fairy tales of east and west dreams play tricks and the adventures of one hero attach themselves to the person of another but every item detail character has the sanction of a long long authority the plan may be a good or a bad one it is good in mr pyles hands for he is a skilful dreamer a brisk storyteller as well as an excellent draughtsman illustration on p 7 from pyles  twilight land osgood see p 4,folklore
old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends current in southern india collected from oral tradition by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere the illustrations by c f frere murray many of those of our countrymen who have spent years in india will be surprised to find that our edd friends the fairies and goblins are as well known in hindu nurseries as in our own it is true that the names are different in the far east from those we give them but their doings are much the same and if we are to be devoured or frightened to death it matters very little whether the horrid monster who is to slay us is called a goblin or a ghid as in persia or a eakshas which is the term in these pages for such fiendish apparitions it must be owned however that if there be any difference in morale between the indian supernatural beings and those duly recognised here it is not in favour of the former the riikbhas seems upon the whole a more hope less and unmitigated fiend than his western brethren to the notorious bad qualities of blunderbore and other gigantic cannibals he adds an excessive filthiness which sinks him to the lowest depths in our estimation not content with chawing up ali the live children princes and princesses that he can meet with he is moreover addicted to tearing the decaying flesh off the bodies of criminals pending from the gallowstree and swallowing it wholesale he is further exceedingly dirty in his person and hence his fingernails are so poisonous that a human being falls down lifeless if scratched by one of them female rakshases present themselves as ugly old women with long claws instead of hands and with natural chignons of dreadfully tangled hair which must on no account ever be combed for excellent reasons to be found in these pages dirtier than the ogre the rakshas is less accommodating than the goblin and would on no account thresh out the corn or in any other way oblige the farmer or any one else like the lubber fiends of the west after these remarks the reader will not expect the rakshas to be a funny character he is simply frightful and disgusting though he sometimes makes a fool of himself by mistaking for instance a donkeys head and an enormous earthenware pot for an apparition of one of his own kin and similar blunders but the rakshas though literally a horrid fool is never amusing the fun of the indian fairy tale is done by the jackal the puck of the hindus one of the best stories in this volume is the jackal the barber and the brahmin in which the jackal plays all sorts of mischievous tricks upon the barber and befriends the brahmin after a comical fashion he induces the barber to join with him in buying a garden and eats up the fruit himself while he makes the barber believe it is not ripe he then marries the brahmins daughter for it turns out that he is in fact a prince who is a great magician and puts on a jackals skin and changes himself into a jackal for a frisk returning to his own shape when he pleases he gives the brahmin a melon which produces fruit full of jewels but the silly brahmin sells them all without looking inside and at last gets taken up on suspicion of theft the jackal then gives him a dish which produces inexhaustible supplies of food but the brahmin cannot keep his own counsel and the magical dish is taken by the rajah foralast present the jackal gives the brahmin a vessel out of which jump a rope and a stick which bind and beat the rajah and the purchaser of the gems until they return to the brahmin what they had taken from him the peris or fairies of these legends are much like other fairies they sleep in pomegranates fly where they please and fall in love with handsome youths ad libitum as a specimen of the tales we will give an extract from the story of surya bai or  the sun lady who is the daughter of a milkwoman and was carried off by eagles when an infant she grows up in the eagles nest which is a very comfortable bungalow indeed at the top of a tall tree the birds having gone a long journey to bring her a diamond ring she just escapes being eaten by a rakshas is rescued by a rajah whom she marries and is pushed into a well by his first wife she is then changed into a sunflower and next into a mango and recovers her human shape but has to grow up from infancy once again   now it came to piss that once when surya bai was taking water from the well for the old milkwoman the rajah rode by and as he saw her walking along he cried  that is my wife and rode after her as fast as possible surya bai hearing a gnat clatter of horses hoofs was frightened and ran home as fast as possible and hid herself and when though rajah reached the place there was only the old milkwoman to be seen standing at the door of her hut then the rajah said to her  give her up old woman you have no right to keep her she is mine she is mine1 but the old woman inswtred are you mad i dont know what you mean the rajah replied do not attempt to deceive me i baw my wife go in at your door she must be in the house your wife screamed the old womanyour wife  you mean my daughter who lately returned from the well do you think i am going to give my chihi up at your command  you are rajah iu your palace hut i am rajah in my own house and i wont give up my little daughter for any bidding of yours be otl with you or i ll pull out your beard ami so saying she seized a long stick and attacked the rajah calling out loudly to her husband and sons w ho came running to her aid the rajah s eing mattrs were against him ami having outridden his attendants and not being quite certain iimrover whether he had seen surya bai or wle tier she might not haw been really the poor viilkwi aus daughter rde off and returned to iir plic however he determined to sift the matt r as a tirt step he went to s  surya 15a old tt  dant who wan ttill in prison from le he i rut enough to mike him believe she wan not  1 niivy innocent i f sun a rai deah but i v v to stip ct the tirst ranee of having caeid it ht therefore ordered the old woman to l  s t at lib itvwill keeping a watchful e aeon iv rand bade her prove her devotion to her long t meriees bv going tn though om milkwoman iv  nd hriigin him as much infonnatiii   psb about the fondly and more particularly about the girl he had si en returning from the well so the attendant went to the milkwomans hons and made friends with her and bought some mdk and afterwards she staved and talked to ber af r a lew days though milk woman ceased to be siii iii of her and became quite cordial surva kus attendant then told how she had been rb lit r uiees waitingwoman and how th rj tli had tb town her into prison on her mistress tbah in r turn tr which intelligence the old milkoman imputed to her how the wonderful nirtigohad tumbled ino lier can as she dept under though tr and bow it had iniraculouly changed in tb  course itn hour into a beautiful little lady   wonder why die should have chosen my poor hons  to live in instead of any one elbes said the old woman then surya rais attendant said  have you ever asked her her history  perhaps she voum not mind telling it to you now so the milkwoman called the girl and as soon as the old attendant xw her she knew it was none i other than surya rai and her heart jumped for j joy but sdio remained silent wondering much for she knew her mistress bad been drownd in the i tank the old mi ik woman turned to surya i5ai i and said  my child you have lived lng with us j and been a nod daughter to me but i have never  asked you ymir hitory because i thought it must j be a sad  iv but if you do not far to tell it to me now t hnvld like to hear it surya bai  answered  motlier you speak true my story is  sad i beliv my real mother was a poer milk j woman like you and that she took me with her one dy wb n i was ipiite a little baby as she was gong to dl milk in the bazaar rut being tired with the long wuk sh sat down to rest and placed me also on the ground when suddenly a great ka de flew down and carried me away rut all the father and mother i ever knew were the two great eaglesah my child my child cried though milkwoman i was that poor woman the eagks hew away with my eldest girl when she waa only a year old have i found you after these many years  and she ran and called all her children and her husband to tellthemthe wonderful news then was there great rejoicing among them all when they were a little calmer her mother said to surya bai  tell us dear laughter how your life has been spent since first we lost you and surya bai went on the old eagles took me away to their home aud there i lived happily many years they loved to bring mo all the beautiful things they could find and at last one day they both went to fetch me a diamond ring from though red sea but while they were gone the fire went out iu the nest so i went to an old womans hut and got her to give me some fire and next day i dont know how it was as i was opening the outer door of the cage a sharp thing that was sticking in it ran into my hand and i fell down senseless i dont know how long i lay there but wheu i carno to myself i found though eagles must have com back and thought me dead and gone away for the diamond ring was on ray little finger a great many people were watching over me and amongst them was a rajah who asked me to go home with him and be his wife and he brought mo to this place and i was his ranee but his other wife the first ranee hated me for she was jealous and desired to kill me and one day she accomplished her purpose by pushing me into the tank for i was young and foolish and disregarded the warnings of my faithful old attendant who begged me not to go near the place ah  if i had only listened to her word i might have been happy still at these words the old attendant who had been sitting in the background rahed forward and kissed surya kais feet crying ah my lady   my lady have 1 found you at last and without j staying to hear more she ran back t though palace to tell the rajah though glad news then surya bai i told her parents how she had not wholly died in  ihe tank but becanic tv sunflower nnd how the first ranee seeing how feud though rajah was of the i plant had caused it to he thrown away  and then j how she had risen from the ashes of the sunflower in the form of a mango tree and how when the tret blossomed all her spirit wt nt into the little j mango flower and she ended by saying and i when the flower became fruit i know not by what  irresistible impulse i was induced to throw myself j into your milk can mother it was my destiny  and rs soon as you took me into your house i j began to recover my human form j of course the rajah soon finds surya bai  and they live happily for the rest of their days i sir b frere tells us in though introduction i  it is probable that most of the stories were i brought from among the lingaets of southern j india the sect to which annadesouzu tells us i her family belonged before their conversion to i christianity this anna de souza was the i ayah who narrated the stories and from whose lips miss frere avrote them down but the book reminds us very much of the gul i bakawali a tale translated into urdu by nihill chand from the persian of shaikh izz ttulhih there is the same  exuberance of imagination the same mixture of the persian peris and dews with the gods and goddesses of the hindu system such as ganpati parvati and shiva the story at page 19b of this volume of  the brahmin the tiger and the six judges will be found nearly word for word nt page zl of the gul i bakawali apropos of this the word written  buceoulee at page 130 of this book is no doubt bahoxtli though story of singh rajah at page 172 occurs in the hitopadcsa as the ninth fable of the book headed separation of friends this only shows how widely and how long the old hindu stories have circulated we cannot conclude without noticing a curious circumstance mentioned in the introduction it seems that ghosts are received with presented arms in india though they are only challenged here  in the more advanced and populous parts of the country though rakshas seems giving way to the  bhoot which more nearly resembles the mero ghost of modern european superstition but even in this diluted form such beings have an influence over indian imaginations to which it is difficult in these days to find any parallel in europe i found quite lately a traditionary order in existence at government house dapoorie near poona which directed the native sentry on guard  to present arms if a cat or dog jackal or goat entered or left the house or crossed near his beat during certain hours of the night because it was the ghostof a former governor who was still remembered as one of the best and kindest of men more practical matter will be found at page xxiii of the introduction where there are some important remarks on the rise of prices in india in those days houserent did not cost more than half a rupee a month and you could build a very comfortable house for a hundred rupees not such good houses as people now live in but well enough for people like us then a whole family could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month as they can now on thirty grain now a rupee a pound was then two annas a pound common sugar then one anna a pound is now worth four annas a pound oil which then sold for six pico a bottle now costs four annas four annaa worth of salt chillies tamarinds onions and garlic would then last a whole family a month  now the same monty would not buy a weeks supply such dungeree as you now pay half a rupee a yard for you could then buy from twenty to forty yards of for the rupee you could not get such good calico then as now but the dungeree did very well beef then was a pice a pound and the vegetables cost a pie a day for half a rupee you could fill the house with wood water also was much cheaper you etdd then get a man to bring you two large skins full morning and evening for a pie now he could not do it under haifa rupee or more if though children came crying for fruit a pie would get them as many guavas as they liked in the bazaar now youd have to pay that for each guava this shows how much more money people need now than they did then in these days when there is a talk of forming a society for though translation of old popular stories miss frere will be admitted to have performed a useful task in recording these curious stories of the hindus the illustrations by c f frere are worthy of all praise and on the whole we cordially recommend the volume of snakeworshipa tempting subject concerning which these pages afford many opportunities to discoursewe shall say nothing at present in expectation of mr fergussous forthcoming work  old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere murray a few ancient legends told by an old hindoo woman to her grandchildren and repeated to miss mary frere who has reduced them to readable english are here given the public the family of anna liberata de souza the  narrator were of the lingaet caste and settling near goa when the english held pcesession of that place were soon after converted to christianity the father and grandfather of anna were both in british employ and she became an ayah although the deccan is included in the title of this book it doe not appear that theta stories originated in that district at burr bartle pren tells na in tha introduction that probably moat of them wan brought from among tha lingaete one of the most stronriy marked divisions of the hindoo neat south of the river kistna collections of stories of this kind an especially valuable at throwing a light on the popular nonbnhmmioal superstitions of the lower classes of india in tha neighlxmrhood of poona where brahminism appears to be to prevalent it it found that vithoba the deified sage kundoba the deified shepherd and byroba the terrible one of the remnants of fetish or snakeworship divide the adoration of the lower castes with the regular hindoo deities but the true history of these local divinities is only to be obtained from popular tradition and it thus becomes important to preserve these evanescent remains of the superstition of a former age en they disappear before the progress of civilisation the most prominent superhuman personage of the legends now before us is the  rakshas a demoniacal ogre of enormous sue and possessing terrible teeth like the ghouls of the  arabian nights his greatest pleasure is feasting on dead bodies  other characteristics will remind the reader of the giants of norse and teutonic descent at present the  rakshas is giving way to the bhoot more nearly allied to our modern european ghost but yet possessing an enormous influence over the native imagination in the hilly and desert districts of sind the belief in supernatural beings is generally prevalent but there the rakshas is transformed to the gin  of the arabian nights the gin ofthe mountainous parts of beloochistan is a  dwarfish human being with large eyes and covered with long hair and is apt to breathe with a heavy snoring kind of noise the cobra or deadly hooded snake also frequently occurs as a supernatural being one of the indications left us of the serpentworship once so prevalent in western india it will surprise many to learn that this worship still exists to some extent among the lower classes and that the cobra is supposed to possess supernatural powers the native does not willingly kill him but endeavours by kind treatment to propitiate him and obtain good fortune for the house to which he belongs there is a curious similarity between the incidents in many of these fables and modern european ones especially those of german origin and here also as in all fairy tales there are certain wellmarked features beautiful princes and princesses continually occur and perform the most wonderful exploits the stepmother is always wicked the youngest daughter good and beautiful and the elder ones are depraved and repulsive the giants and ogres are as easily deceived as the cyclopes from whom sinbad escaped or as polyphemus whom the crafty ulysses blinded the jackal takes the place of his european cousin the fox and by his ingenuity and tact generally conquers every difficulty  and proves a bright moral example of the success of wit against brute j forcethe triumph of mind over matter we observe however in the story tit for tat of this collection that the ordinarily stupid camel not only drowns the jackal but has the best of the argument also in the legend of  pnnchkin the wicked magician we trace a great resemblance between him and the wizards of the arabian nights he possesses the same power of changing men and women into stones trees or animals  he can build up a palace by a wave of his wand and create a river or a mountain by his magic arts the romance of brave seventee bai in which a woman shows so much prudence judgment and valour is somewhat remarkable as the production of a country where the fair sex are held in general contempt miss mary frere puts forward the conjecture that some aggrieved old woman might have invented this narrative the following fable might be used to illustrate emersons celebrated essay on compensation liss inequality than ken deem a young rajah once said to his wuzeer  how is it that i am so often ill  i take great care of myself i never go out in the rain i wear wann clothes i eat good food yet i am always catching cold or getting fever in spite of all precautions overmuch care is worse than none at ail answered the wuzeer which i will soon prove to yon so he invited the rajah to accompany him for a walk in the fields before they had gone very far they met a poor shepherd the shepherd wae accustomed to be ont all day long tending his flock he had only a coarse cloak on which served bnt insufficiently to protect him from the rain and the coldfrom the dews by night and the san by day his food was parched corn his drink water and he lived out in the fields in a small hut made of plaited palm branches the wuzeer said to the rajah you know perfectly well what hard lives these poor shepherds lead accost this one and ask him if he often sniffers from the exposure which heis obliged to undergo the rajah did as the wusser told him and asked the shepherd whether he did not often suffer from rheumatism cold and fever the shepherd answered  perhaps it will surprise yon sire to hear that i never suffer from either the one or the other from childhood i have been accustomed to endure the extremes of hest and cold and i eunpoee that is why they never affect me at thie the rajah was very much astonished and he said to the wuxeer  1 own i am surprised bnt doubtless this shepherd is an extraordinarily etrong man whom nothing would ever affect we shall see enid the wusser and he invited the shepherd to the palace there for a long time the shepherd wss taken great care of he was never permitted to go out in the sun or rain he had good food and good clothes and he was not allowed to sit in a draught or get his feet wet at the end of some months the wuseer ssnt for him into a marble courtyard the floor of which he caused to be sprinkled with water the shepherd had been for some time so little need to exposure of say kino that wetting his feet caused him to take cold the place felt to him chilly and damp after thc palace he rapidly became worse aad in a short time in spite of all the doctors care he died  where ie our friend the shepherd   asked the besh a few days afterwards   he surely could not have caught com merely by treadiaf on the nwbu floor yon liad caused to be sprinklad with water  alastn answered the wnaeera the reault wm mow disastrous than i had anticipated the poor shepherd caught cold and is dead having been lately accustomed to overmuch care the sudden change of temperature killed him  yon see now to want dsssers we are exposed from which the poor are exempt it ie thus that nature equalises her best gifts wealth and opulence tend too frequently to destroy health and shorten life though they may give much enjoyment to it whilst it lasts the moral of these fables is generally good in one is celebrated the victory of truth over falsehood in another ingratitude is chastised  and in a third an undutiful child is destroyed by a serpent in  a funny story  we have the terrible punishment of a wicked woman who was ashamed of her mother and illtreated her  and a powerful and sagacious cobra who is the good genius of the virtuous and also in the end the nemesis of evildoers we cannot refrain from quoting no 10 which is a romance of the heavenly bodies and a lesson to all greedy and selfish people now nix sim thb hook um tux wrap went out to dinnek one day the san the moon and the wind went out to dine with their uncle and aunt the thunder and lightning their mother one of the most distant stars you see far up in th sky waited alone for her childrens return now both the sun and the wind were greedy and selfish they enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their motherbnt the gentle moon did not forget her of every dainty dish that was brought round she placed a small portion under one of her beautiful long fingernails that the star might also have a share in the treat on their return their mother who had kept watch for them all night long with her little bright eye said u well children what have you brought home for me then the sun who was eldest said  i have brought nothing home for you i went out to enjoy myself with my friendsnot to fetch a dinner for my mother and the wind said neither have i brought anything home for you mother yon could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for yon when i merely went out for my own pleasure bnt the moon said  mother fetch a j plate see what i have brought you and shaking her hands she showered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before then the star turned to the snn and spoke thus  because you went out to amuse yourself with your friends and feasted and enjoyed yourself without any thought of your mother at home you shall be cursed henceforth your rays shall be ever hot and scorching and shall burn all that they touch and men shall hate you and cover their heads when you appear and that is why the sun is so hot to this day then she turned to the wind and said  you also forgot your mother in the midst of yonr selfish pleasureshear your doom you shall always blow in the hot dry weather and shall parch and shrivel all living things and men shall detest and avoid you from this very time and that is why the wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable but to the moon she said daughter because you remembered your mother and kept for her a share in your own enjoyment from henceforth you shall be ever cool and calm and bright no noxious glare shall accompany yonr pure rays and men shall always call you  blessed and that is why the moons light is so soft and cool and beautiful even to this day  miss mary frere has executed her task with judgement and skill and has made a pleasing selection of original fables and ancient legends the style is simple but effective and very well suited to these tales of the countryside the introduction and notes by sir bartle frere are carefully written and contain much valuable information respecting the ancient traditions usages and mythology of the tribes of southern india the illustrations are prettily drawn by miss catherine frere and the coloured ones especially are very effective the book would form an appropriate present for a child and at the same time would be read with interest by persons of mature years,folklore
fairy tales fairies may be simple or sophisticated beautiful or hideous friendly or hateful prim and precise or tanglehaired and teasing  but whatever they are their adventures should always be told simply its hopeless to make a fuss about the fairies the fuss aesthetic the fuss of folklore the fuss moralizing the fuss gruesome all of these are ruin for a fairy tale for children the best authors have been guilty at times there are moments when even andersen makes the reader sit up with an indignant  that didnt happen and then with a delicate pop away goes the fairy tale and ones happy credulity the best stories are the old stories told quite simply  they may be in language a little conventional as was the language of mrs freers  old deccan days  and some of the older versions of the  arabian nights but they must have that gravity that respectful manner which show that the author does not regard his work with anything but a serious craftsmans interesthe is neither writing down norworse horror writing up of our ghristmas fairy books this year one is written by a man who has a touch a little beyond talent mr james stephens in irish fairy tales macmillan 15s net has not forgotten that he is writing for children  he keeps his humour and his rather rascally gaiety and the wisdom in his stories of fionn and oisin bran and mongan is quiet and unobtrusive he gives too a definition of fairyland which may serve for the older ones as well as for the children   everything that is here is there but the things that are there are better than those that are here all things that are bright are there brighter there is more gold in the sun and more silver in the moon of that land there is more scent on the flowers more savour in the fruit there is more comeliness in the men and more tenderness in the women mr rackhams pictures are amazing in their grotesque fancy the reptiles the uncanny rocks the ogreish people could not be bettered  but his beautiful people are not

derive from the book of kells but could bear looking at beside that splendour some of her crowded swift little pictures have the genuine thrill which the low ceilings and hot atmosphere of rossetti can give there is too a real touch of individuality about the pictures especially about the figures  miss paul is a truer mediaevalist than were the preraphaelite brothers yet there is a slight affectation in the work and a good deal in the text miss paul will not be as simple as she knows how and so misses the reward which she might have miss chaundler has rifled the old legends in  arthur

the algonquin legends of new england b charles g leland sampson low  co when mr leland offers from the mic mac a tale partly in blank verse as far as form goes and in plot a mixture of the french tale of the bears son and the conclusion of the scotch 4 nicht nocht nothing one feels at first as if things were not all as they should be in mic mac this story is styled  the three strong men  pp 311 323 in the narrative comes a sevenheadti devil one of the beings so familiar in slavonic miirchen then the critic turns back to p 207 where mr leland tells him that  this srheaded son  of hymer in the vafthrudnismal reappears as a demon in the passamaquoddy tale of  the three strong men whatever may be the case in passamaquoddy certainly in mic mac the demon is sevenheaded then rises the question why should the seven  headed or sixheaded in passamaquoddy demon be the sixheaded son of hymer of the  vafthrudnismal why indeed  we cannot answer the question though we feel certain that the mic mac story is a compound of two stories which are european though also found more or less in malagasy mr leland himself admits part of this the story consists of a very old indian legend mingled with a european fairy tale drawn through a french canadian source but what part of the tale is very old indian  the original mr leland says  is from beginning to end a song or poem that is why we presume he has rendered so much of it into blank verse printed as prose in the tale the hero loses his memory and forgets his bride when his hand is licked by a black dog this is the celtic idea of the man who was to let no one kiss him and who lost all memory of the past when  kissed  by a dog we fail to see what is indian in the whole tale except perhaps mention of wigwams and the like now if this tale be so notably european though already converted into a kind of chant by the mic macs and if the norse identifications p 207 be so far from convincing to a moderate scepticism the rest of mr lelands collection is also not likely to be accepted without shyness he is perhaps chiefly interested himself in the resemblances between the tricky lox of passamaquoddy and the tricky loki of scandinavian myth the resemblances are often strong but would be stronger if for example mr leland offered p 271 any proof that  the fellow who played the trick a trick very like one of lokiswas lox he says  we may very easily detect the hand of lox the mischiefmaker in this last incident but lox has never been mentioned or hinted at in the tale mr leland may he right but every one must decide for himself as to the plausibility of the conjecture mr leland thinks that a good deal of eddaic lore has filtered through the eskimo to the algonquins and certainly many curious coincidences in eddaic and indian folklore may be accounted for by that hypothesis though we are not yet convinced of its accuracy perhaps for complete proof other examples of indian institutions dress weapons gear of every kind derived from norsemen might be adduced they would certainly strengthen the hypothesis one story which represents  master rabbit as originally the possessor of a long tail will at once suggest  brer babbit did the negroes borrow this incident from the indians or the indians from the negroes or did both invent it separately or did both derive it from a common source  these are questions which it is all but impossible to answer many of the negro rabbit tales have been brought from africa where they were told about a beast not very unlike a rabbit superficially perhaps others have been borrowed from indian sources on all these points it is hard or rather it ought to be impossibleto dogmatize at present we confess that after reading all mr lelands talesvery good tales very well told  we are slightly inclined not to believe in scandinavian influence on the algonquin legends the evidence and inferences are evenly balanced and perhaps it is only the hardness of the mythological heart that resists in any case mr lelands book though we wish he had avoided blank verse is extremely interesting and valuable both in itself and in its probable effects other american collectors of the red mens legends will be encouraged we hope to publish them as literally as possible this is the great point already we knew from schoolcraft and others that the red mens tales resemble and in fact are variants of the european marchen how much of this likeness is due to scandinavian and more recent french and english influences that is precisely the question which at present it is impossible to answer but which many readers of mr lelands book will reply to by voting for an infiltration of the edda only he himself can state his case at sufficient length and with his own evidence so to algonquin legends we send the mythologist no abstract can or should satisfy him,folklore

icelandic l g nih collected by jn aroason translated by g e j powell and e magnusson bentley tins is a collection of capital stories the translators have taken its items from the immense gathering made by m arnason the first instalment of which was published in leipzig in 102 under the title of icelandic national stories and tales as they do not propose a wnrk of learning but rather to give a general idea of the traditions of iceland they have exercised their oihee with freedom and judgement in relieving the collection of many things that are cumbrous and of others that are painful to english susceptibilities in general this portion of the work has been well done and keeping the special object of the publication in view we admit that the tales are improved by such treatment although for other ends we do not admire meddling of the kind we wish we could southwest that the illustrations of which though book cont lins many were worthy of the text the contents are divided into1 stories of elves 2 of water monsters 3 of trolls 4 of goblins and ghosts  miscellaneous if the reader is curious to know thc genesis of elves he may learn all that is known abouc it from the first tale which says that when though almighty visited eve and adam he inquired of the former for thc whole of her children now it so happened that she had not finished washing some of them and being ashamed of their dirty condition averred that the clean ones were the whole of her family of course the maker was not to be deceived in this manner so he said what man hides from god god will hide from man these unwashed children became forthwith invisible and took up their abode in mounds and hills and rocks from these the elves descended in stories treated as these have been the reader must not expect to find the uncouthness and picturesque crudity of the versions of scandinavian folklore to be met with in prof b thorpes traditions and tales of scandinavia and north germany but on that account to the general reader the work before us will be more acceptable the selection has generally been made with a purpose not merely philosophical or archaological but to evolve the dramatic elements of the originals and without intrusiveness to emphasise a moral in them it does not need much to render this characteristic of the tales expressive enough indeed it is curious how often the very nerve of some quaint relation vibrates to the ethic charm resolution patience chastity fortitude obedienceare frequent themes of these legends those qualities never tail to get honour and success at the same time there is a sort of placid indifference to clanger and an ignorance of irritability displayed by the heroes that are characteristic of scandinavian legends and give to them a startling and novel effect all readers of the sagas and northern traditions are struck with this imperturbability of the heroes which is curiously different from the impassivity attributed by the greeks to the higher ranks of immortals and not often found in the sustained epics of the nibelungen cycle in the first this imperturbability is far removed from mere stolidity the nonchalance of the frankish heroes arises frequently from concentration of their passions and seems assumed we find in the shepherd of silfninarstadir a curious example of this imperturbability and also of that strange endowing of christian priests with magical powers which is doubtless a relic of paganism such an endowing appears again in  blue face a noteworthy story of white magic in  the bishop and the elves and with great force in the black school and its sequels we forget whether it is prof b thorpe or mr keightlcy who avers that we have in england no wateridves or fairies morgan la fay is an instance to the contraryunless indeed she is held to be not indigenous we cannot say that so far as our knowledge of the tales of such folk extends that thc loss is great for with the exception of undinea story which owes a great deal to its modern costume there are not many we care for even among the outlandish legendsof course after excluding those which have nothing but mere background to associate them with the watery world among the few however that are estimable of the legends of necks mermen mermaids nikke the stromkarl or fossegrimm sec all haunters of diverse sorts of waters and much addicted to music there are several of high poetic order having the aspect of a newworld about them and showing the wondrous insight of their inventors ol seaspirits the number is very small whose acquaintance one desires to retain  but the few have a grandeur apart from mere considerations of vastness we should have liked to find in this book more icelandic stories of fresh coast and ocean waterspirits the shadowy government of which  the ecclesiastical history of iceland by finnus johaniueus tells us that it repeats in every detail the actions of the human natives of the island might one would think supply no end of such stories to this day the people believe that king pharaoh and his army were changed into seals in the shetlands wo have says dr hibbert a submarine nation of sea trows many of the stories in this book are almost identical with some that are to be found in grimm and being so need not have been repeated some partially resemble those of germany but have a fresh spirit in them that adds a charm and often a grand mystery what mystery there lies in such a tale aa  kathis dream and in  the boy who knew not fear is not hard to guess of another sort here is a story for the first good little girl you meet near a certain farm long ago three children were playing on a grass mound a little girl and two boys after they had played for some time the girl who was the youngest of them found a dee hole in the ground so deep that she could not see the bottom of it stooping down bhe thrust her hand into it and shutting her eyes cried out in fun put something in the palm of an old beggar and old beggar shall not see no sooner had she said the words than a large silver button was placed in her hand when the other children saw her good luck they were fit to burst with envy and the eldest of them stooping down thrust his hand into the hole too and said  put something into the hand of an old beggar and old beggar shall not see for he hoped to get something at least as good as the little girl had got if not better indeed but no far from it when he drew his hand out again he only found hd had lost the use of it and what was more never recovered it again for the elf who hated envy more than anything in the world had given it a squeeze the above is similar though superior tojthe breton tale of the korred dance told by villemerque here is an eerie tale of another sort  once on a winter evening it happened that j5n arason bishop of h51ar wanted a book which he had left lying on the altar of the church so called his household folk together and asked which of them would do him the favour of fetching the book for bim they all shuddered at the idea and all drew back except one maidservant who declared herself quite willing to go and not in the least afraid now the bishop having enemies as who has not had made a tunnel from his own house which was called the palace underground tothe church with a view to being able if need should ever be to take sanctuary at a moments notice and unobserved through this tunnel the maid went having procured the keys of the church but when she had taken the book from the altar bhe determined not to go back through the tunnel which she had found dismal and ghostly but rather round the other way so she walked down the church with the keys to the outer door and looking towards the benches where the women were wont to sit she saw there a human skeleton with long yellow hair amazed at this but in no way frightened she went up to the figure and said  who are you v upon which the skeleton said  i am a woman and have long been dead but my mother cursed me so that i can never corrupt and return to the dust whence i sprung now therefore my good girl i entreat you to release me from this ban if it lies in your power  but answered the girl  it does not lie in my power so far as i now know tell me how i can help you then the skeleton replied  you must ask my mother to forgive me my faults and to annul her curse for bhe may very likely do for the living what she refuses to do for the dead it is a rare thing indeed for the living to ask favours of the dead where is your mother then asked the maiden  oh said the other  she ls here there and everywhere now for example she is yonder in the choir then the maiden went through the door into the choir and saw sitting there on one of the benches a wondrous ugly old woman in a red hat to whom she addressed herself asking her to be good enough to forgive her daughter and remove from her the curse after pausing awhile plainly unwilling the old hag answered  well it is not often that you living people ask favours of me so for once i will say to you yea having thanked her for her goodness the maiden went back towards the outer door but when she came to the place where she had seen the skeleton found there only a heap of dust so she went towards the door and as she opened it she heard a voice from the inner part of the church which cried after her  look at my red eyes how red they are and without turning round she answered look at my black back how black it is the bold maiden passed the elfswarming churchyard in spite of screams and yells and safely delivered the book to the bishop need we say that we commend this book to the reader and should gladly welcome a complete translation of the original by m jon arnason i,folklore

ridiculous is but one step as napoleon once observed and the renmark iarticularly applies to works of literature ithe author of the delightfiil little volume before us appears to have hit the happy mediumr he has not only given us some highly amusing tales illustrative of the superstitions of the irish peasantry but hie has proved himself an admirable r arontetur and eihibits a rery curious but striking picture of irish society for it cannot be denied that the superstitions of every people have a powerful  fluence on their conduc t 0d d antnenr of uti nking to m1ir crofton croker the author of the volume before us the world is already indebted for an excellent work on ireland he is not only a very pleasing writer but as a most intimate knowledge of ireland her traditions and the character manners and customs of the people indeed we know no writer of the present day whose information on such points is more extensive and we should almost designate him the sir wnalter scott of the emerald isle  his work contains some admirable tales illustrative of irish superstitions and his notes display a ery minute acquaintance with his subject wvith these remarks we shall select two or three of these irish legends the first is entitled the lrg end of bottlehill come listen to a tale of times of old come listen to me it was in the good days when the little people most impudently called fairies were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times that a farmer named mlick purcell rented a few acres of barren around in the neighbourlhood of the once celebrated preceptory of mourne situated about three miles from mallow and thirteen from  the beautiful city called cork mick had a wife and family they all did what they could and that was but little for the poor mans had no child grown up big enough to help him iii his work and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children and to milk the one cow and to boil the potatoes and carry the eggs to market to mallow but with all they could do twas hard enough on them to pay the rent well they did manacre it for a good while but at last came a bad year and the little grain of oats was all spoiled and the chickens died of the pip and the pi got the measlesshe was sold in m1allow and brought almost nothing and poor miick found that he hadnt enough to half pay his rent and two gales were due why then mlolly says lie  what 11 we do v  wisha then mavournene wlhat would you do but take the cow to the fair of cork and sell her says she and monday is fair day and so you must go tomorrow that the poor beast may be rested agaim the fair and what 11 we do when she s gone says mick sorrowfully  never a know i know lick but sure god wont leave us without him mick and you know bow good he was to us when poor little billy was sick and we had nothingr at all for him to take that good doctor gentlemen at ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk and how he gave us two shillinos and how he sent the things and the bottles for the child and gave me my breakfast when i went over to ask a question so he did and how lhe came to see billy and never left off his goodness till he was quite well  oh you are always that way molly and i believe you are right after all so i wont be sorry for selling the cow but ill go tomorrow and you must put a needle and thread  rough my coat tor you know  tis ripped wider the arn molly told himi he shouldl have every th1inhg righlit and about twelve oclock next dav he left her getting a charge not to sell his cowv except for the higlles penny mick promised to nliud it and went his way along the road he drove his cow slowly through the little stream which crosses it and rtins under the old walls of mlourne as he passel lie glanced hlis eves upon the towers and one of the old elder trees which were only then little bits of switches oh then if i only had half the money thats buried in you tisnt drivinx thlis poor cow 1 d he now why thenr isn t it too bad that it should be there covered over with earth and many a one besides me wvantingr it well if it s gods will i ll have some money myzself coming lack so sayigs he moved on after his beast twas a fine dav and the sunt shone brightly on the walls of the old abbey as hie passed under them  hie then crossed an extensive mountain tract and after six long min es lhe came to the top of

and mlick retraced the road towards his cabin but lhe could not help turding back his head to look after the purchaser of his cow who was nowhere to lbe seen   lord between us and harm  said mick  he cant belong to this earth but swhere is the cow  she too was gone and iick went homeward muttering prayers and bolling fast the bottle and what would i do if it broke thought hie  oh  but i 11 take care of that  so he put it into his bosom and went on anxious to prove his bottle and loubting of the reception he should meet from his wife lbalancing his anxieties wvith his expectation his fears wviti his hopes he reached home in the evenina and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney oh mick are you come back sure you werent at cork all the way w that has happened to you where is the cow  did you sell her ihow much money did you get for her wx1hat news have you tell us every thing about it wwhy then molly if you ll give me time ill tell vou all about it if you

mlick  cant you hearken to reason didnt i tell you how the old man or wh0jatsoever he  was nmet me no did not meet me neither hut he was thlere with meon the lig hill and how he tnmae me sell him the cow and told me the  hxotte was the only thing for me  yys indeed the only thing for you you fool i said molly seizing the biottle to url it at her poor husbands head but mlick eaught it a quietl for hie ininded the old i inwas adviice loosened lis wifes gsp aud i the bottle again in his bosom poor placed tle bottle arain in him bosom poor lolly sat down crying while mick told her his story with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm his wife could not hell believing him particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest who indeed never liscouraged her belief in the fairies may be he didnt know she believed in them and may be he believed them himself she got up however without saying one word and began to sweep thfe earthen floor with a bunch of heath then she tilied up every thing and put out the long table and spread the clean cloth for she had only one upon it anl alick placing the bottle on the ground looked at it and said bottle do your duty  l look thiere  look there marnmy  sail his chubby eldest son a loy about five years old look there  look there  and he sprung to his mothers side as two tiny3 little fellows rose like liglht froin the bottle and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver full of the finest victuals that ever were seen and when all wvas done wvent into the bottle again alick and his wife looked at every thingr with astonishment they had never seen such plates and dishles before and didnt think they could ever admire them enough the very sight almost took away their appetites but at length amolly said come and sit down mick and try and eat a bit sure you ought to be hungry after such a good days work w hy then the man told no lie about the bottle lick sat down after putting the children to the table and they made a hearty meal though they couldnt taste half thle dishes now says molly  i wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these file things again they waited but no one came so molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully saying  why then mick that was no lie sure enough  but you ll be a rich mhan yet ialick purcell  mick and his wife and children went to their bed not to sleep but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want and to take more land amick xvent to cork and sold his plate and bought a horse and cart and began to show that he was making money and tley did all they could to keep thle bottle a secret buat for all that their landlord found it out for hie came to alick one lay and asked him where he got all his mnoneysure it was not by the farm  and hie bothered him so much that at last amick told him of the biottle eis lanidlord offered him a deal of money for it but mliek would not give it till at last lhe offered to give hinm all his farm for ever so alick whco was very irich thought hed never want any more money and gave limn the bottle  but mlick was mistaken  he and his famnily spent money as if there  as no end of it and to make the story short they became poorer and poorer till at las tipev hlad nothing left but one cow and mick once more drove his cow before him to sell hier at cork fair hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle it was hardly daybreak when lie left   1 home and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill the mists were sleep ing in the valleys and curling like snoke wreaths upon the brown heath around hin the sun rose on his left and just at his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured forth its joyous matin song ascending into the clear blue sky  till its form like a speck in the airinesn blending and thrilling with music was nmelting in light m mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark 1ut thinking notwithstanding all the time of tile little old man when just as he reached tfie summit of the hill and cast his eves over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voice well mick purcell j toll you you would be a rich man  nieed then sure enough 1 was thats no lie for you sir good morning to you but it is not rich i an nowbut leave you another bottle for i want it nowv as much w i did long ago so if you have it sir here is the cow for it an ad here is tthe bottle said the old man smilinr  you know what to do witiit c s4 oh  then sure i do as good right i have well farewell for ever mlick purcell i told you you would be a rich man and good bye to you sir said mick as he turned back  and good luck to you and good luck to the big hillit wantsa namebottle hillgood bye sir good bye so mick walked back as fast as he could never looking after the whitefaced little gentlenman and the cow so anxious was he to brings home the bottlewell he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw molly oh  sure ife another bottle   arrah  then have you  why then you re a lucky man amick purcell thats whifat you are  in an instant she put ev ery thing right and alick looking at his bottle exult inglt cried out  bottle do your duty in a twinkling two great stout men with bio cudgels issued from the bottle i do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they event again mlick as soon as be recovered got up and looked about him he thomudht and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him lhe wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to mick v well what do you want now nothing sir only i heave another bottle 01 ho is it as good as the first yes sir and better if you like i will slhow it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen c come along then so saying mick was brought into the great hall where he sat bis old battle standing hi h uwn a shep ah ihail says he to himself if may be i woat have you by and by tic now says his landlord show us our bottle mick set it on the floor and 4nered the words in a moment the landlord nvas tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaringr and sprawling and kicking and 5hrieking wine  cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out  stop those two devils mick purcell or ill have you hanged   they never shall stop said amick till i get my own bottle that i see up there at top of that slhelf 4 give it down to him give it down to hnim before wve are all killed  says the landlord m mick put his bottle in his bosom in iumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried them home i need not lengthen mv story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upoil i it ay and so twill be always bottle luill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story the next legend we shall quote is entitled tihe field of boliauns torn fitzpatrick was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who lived at ballincollig tom was just turned of nineandtwentywhen he met the following adventure and was as clever clean tight goodlooking a boy as any in the whole county cork one fine day in harvestit was indeed ladyday in harvest that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the yeartom was taking a ramble through the ground and went sauntering along the sunny side of a lhedge thinking in himself where would be the great harin if people instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all were to shake out the hay and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge specially as the weather had been rather broken of late he all of a sudden heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge dear me said tom  but isnt it surprising to hear the storieclhatters sinainry so late in the season  so tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if hie was right in his guess the noise stopped but as tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hledge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee dinny dony bit of an old man with a little innffy of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head and a deeshy daushy leather apron hangingbefore him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a ittle piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and thern sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heelpiece on a bit of a broglue just fitting for himself well by the powers  said tom to himself  i often etad toll of the cluricaune and to tell gods truth i never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest if i go knowingly to work i in a made man they say a body must never take their eyes off them or they 11 escape  tom now stole on a little farther with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse or as we read in books the rattlesnake does withl the birds he wants to enchant so when he got up quite close to him  god bless your work neighbour said tom  the little man raised up his head and thank you kindly said he  i wonder youd be working on the holiday  said tom t hats my own business not yours was the reply w jrell may be you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there  said torn i  that i will with pleasure said lhe its good beer b eer  said tom  thunder and fire where did you get it  w where lid i oet it is it why i made it and what do you think i made it of  devil a one of me knows said toin but of malt i suppose what else  there you re out i made it of hcath of heath  said tom bursting out laughint sure you dont think me to be such a fool as to believe that  i io as you please said he  but what i tell you is the truth did you never hear tell of the danes   and that i did said tom  werent them the fellows we gave such a licking when they thouglht to take limerick from us  hen  said the little man drily is that all you know about the matter  well but about them danes said tom  why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in mny family ever since  twill you give a body a taste of your beer  said tom  ill tell you what it is young manit wouild be fitter for you to be lookiing after your fathiers property thaii to be botherino decent quiet people with your foolish questions there now while you re idling away your time here theres the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corni all about  tom was taken so by surprise with this that lhe wvas just on the very point of turnincr round when he recollected himself so afiraid that the like might happen again hie made a grab at the cluricaune and catught him up in his hand but in his hurry hie overset the pitcher and spilled all the beer so that hie could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was isle then swore what lhe would not do to him if he did not show him where his money wats tom looked so nwicked and so bloodyminded that the little man was quite frightened so says hli 1 conie along n itll j11c a 0o111 le of fields off and ill show vvu a tvtw k jf gold i i i i i so they went and tom held the cluricaune fast in his hand and never took his eves from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog for the cluricaune seemed out of pure mischief to pick out the hardest and most con trary way till at last they came to a geat field all full of boliaun buies ragweed and the cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun and says hie  dig under that bohiaun and youll get the vreat crock all full of guineas tom in his hurry had never minded three bringing a spade with him so he thought to run home and fetch one and that hie might know the place again he took off one of h red garters and tied it round the boliaun i suppose said the cluricaune very civilly youve no farther occasion for me no says tom you may go away now if you please and god speed you and may good lick attend you wherever you go well good bye to you tom fitzpatrick said the luricaune and much good may do you with what youll get 6so tom ran for the dear life till hle came home anid got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the tield of boliauns but when hie got there lo arnd behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very identical model of his own tied about it and as to diggi g up the wnhole field that was all nonsense for there was more than forty good irish acres in it so tom cane horn again with his spade on h is shoulder a little cooler than he went and inany s the hearty curse lhe grave the cluricaune every time he thoulght of the neat turn he had served him the last we shall quote isthe little sh0e now tell nie amolly said mlr coote to molly cogan as hle met her on the road one day close to one of t1se old gateways of kilmallock ldid you ever hear of the cluricauine is it the

sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in such a state as to admit of philological guesses but folktales and not philology are the scope of mr wratislaws interesting and useful book which we feel sure will be heartily welcomed bv all folklorists as it is the

tales of the teutonic lands by g w tuox aa and e h jones longman and co 2872 while many of our poets are turning for inspiration to the old medixval legends and knightly traditions mr cox is engaged in a far different task that of demonstrating the utterly untrustworthy character of our old national tales like the german critics of another school he endeavours to resolve every legend into its pristine elements and traces the rise of popular beliefs back to the emblematic sayings and oriental imagery of the pflmxeval aryan herdsman to question the doctrines of the school of comparative mythologists which is represented in england by professor max mfiller mr tylor mr baringgould and by mr cox himself is now as great a heresy as to doubt the common origin of the language of shakespeare and the language of the vedas or to deny that when moores lalla rookh was sungby moonlight in the persian tongue along the streets of ispahan it was merely a change from one dialect to another strikingly as the theory of the  solar  origin of myths is confirmed by every fresh discovery that is made we are yet inclined to think that m r c o x sometimes seems to carry it to excess and that many solar myths are capable of a much simpler interpretation we foresee also f o r t h e comparative mythologists an approaching conflict with the theologians in fact it is impossible to read such a work as the mythology of the aryan nations  without seeing how the theories and views therein laid down may be one day used in much the same way as the destructive criticisms of niebuhr the present volume is on the same plan as a former volume by the same authors  popular romances of the middle ages  as in that work the old tomes of sir thomas mallory were modernised and recast with a characteristic preface pointing out the singular similarity between the arthurian legend and other aryan lore so in the present case teutonic and scandinavian legends are retold of these the stories of the volsungs and the nibelungenlied are comparatively fresh to english readers the lay of gudrun and the  grettir saga  are known to the admirers of mr morris and the story of burnt njal has been already told by dr dasent but reading these stories anew by the light thrown on them in mr cox preface we find fresh matter of interest in tracing back the various incidents to their primitive form that the remarkable coincidences found in the tales in many instances are proof conclusive of a common origin can scarcely be doubted in the mythology of almost every nation we find the same episodes repeated take for example the tale of hugdietrich and hildeburg here we have the old story  a maiden living high up in a lone tower a prince to gain access to her disguising himself as a woman the child when born exposed in the woods carried off by a wolf and saved unknowingly by its grandfather in these episodes we see merely versions of  the old tales in which a maiden is shut up in a lonely tower and none can approach her except the knight who is destined to win her whether it be danae or rapunzel or the rose of the alhambra all precautions are in vain craft achieves what force vainly strives to accomplish and in the guise of the womanly theseus or achilleus or dionysos hugdietrich finds his way to the prison house of hildeburg where like odysseus he shows his skill in weaving the legend of the birth of his child is a travesty of the myths of cyrus romulus telephos and many others it is to be noticed however that the exposure and preservation of the child does not as in such cases as that of oedipus bring destruction on the parents if all these episodes are precisely similar it follows that the earliest version we can find will give us the key to the enigma and this mr cox has elsewhere found in the  solar myth  explanation which practically reduces every legend to a mere allegory of the successions of day and night thus the wellknown story of danae shut up in a brazen tower and visited by zeus in the form of a shower of gold is explained as an allegory of the sun pouring his bright golden rays upon the earth and bringing to light the hidden treasures of vegetation which lie hidden in her dark bosoma more poetical solution of the mysterious shower of gold than the matteroffact explanation of horace which seems almost as if objecting by anticipation to the modern viewaurum per medios ire satellites et perrumpere amat saxa potentius ictu fulmineo again we find in these stories the frequent recurrence of the posthumous child who revenges the death of his father or whose birth is the cause of the death of his mother in the first story which mr cox gives us volsung the son of rerir is like macduff from his mothers womb untimely rippd the explanation given of this that it is simply an allegory of  one day succeeding another though founded on many plausible grounds seems to us scarcely satisfactory the frequent recurrence of the fatal births are we think more symbolical of the little regard in which women were held in ancient times and we can quite understand how of some of the fierce heroes of antiquity it might well be said that their mothers had but little part in their birth and nature and that they drew their strength from the savage beasts that acted as their foster mothers we think too that too much stress is laid on the derivations of the old namesfor example the name astyages which is identified with azidahaka or zohak is considered to afford conclusive proof of the unhistorical character of the story for our own part we fail to see why a persian should not bear the name of the  biting snake as well as an indian should be termed the  bear  or the  wolf we can imagine centuries hence a future mythologist questioning the existence of the grosvenor family on the ground that their name gros veneur recalls the tradition of ierne the hunter that in many instances the comparative mythologists have succeeded in explaining the grotesque and often repulsive features of the old legends we freely admit and we perfectly agree in many cases with the interpretations which trace them back to allegories of the succes sion of day and night our aryan forefathers in the remote distance of countless ages may well have deified the powers of nature to the savage the roar of the water fall the sound of the night winds moaning through the forests may well have been the voices of the gods in the early stage when man seeks theological  expla nations for natural processes we can clearly see howv the sun and moon the snow and frost the wind and vapour which we now recognise as merely fulfilling his word were to the mind of our simple and untutored forefathers guided by supreme deities each to be feared and adored and so when the fierce rays of an eastern sun drank up the cool dews wlhich overspread the face of the earth we can easily see how from the saying the sungod has destroyed the goddess of the dew was developed such a legend as that of apollo and daphne but still we think that the presence of human feelings and sympathies in popular legends has scarcely received sufficient consideration grotesque and repulsive as many of them are we can plainly trace ideas of a conflict between moral light and moral darkness of human feelings underlying the whole it may be that the tale of orpheus and eurydice can be interpreted as a solar myth the journey of orpheus in search of his lost bride tells also of the love that conquers death and the myths of the sungod trampling the night under his feet symbolise that future triumph of good over evil to which all creeds all nations alike look forward as regards the mode in which these legends are told we must give great credit both to mr cox and mr e h jones though we are at a loss to understand why the latter chooses to write yarl instead of jarl that the wild scandinavian legends lose nothing in their new dress may be seen by comparingsay the legend of baldur and the death of njal and bergthora with the corre sponding versions in mallets  northern antiquities a book which was always a great favourite of ours we can recommend teutonic tales to all classes of readers as being a volume full of the most exciting adventures of curious legend and of old tradition a volume which will serve to interest and amuse the most idle reader and may form an almost inexhaustible storehouse of reflection and study to the more thoughtful student  tales of the teutonic lands tales of the teutonic lands by george w cox ma and eustace hinton jones authors ofpopular romances of the middle ages longmans students of mythology will not complain and they who read only for amusement will be glad at the issuing of another quite popular volume by such a master in the science of comparative mythology as mr cox in the  popular romances of the middle ages he and his skilful fellowworkman mr e h jones drew chiefly upon the arthurian cycle of legends and other old tales that were popular with our english forefathers for illustrations of the way in which various portions of the great body of aryan mythology have been nationalised and localised their purpose thoroughly accomplished being to give the pith of the original stories in a form that would furnish a true idea of their mediaeval shape and at the same time make easy the apprehension of their relation to the sources from which they sprang the same process has been adopted by the same compilers in the volume before us which ought to be even more welcome than its predecessor to many readers because most of the stories told in it are less familiar in this country than those told in the other nearly all the condensed translations are by mr jones and include the stories of the volsungs the nibelung story the gudrun lay and the tales of fri th j of and ingebjorg of grettir though strong of gunnlaug and the fair helga and of burnt njal mr cox contributes only versions of the stories of walter of aquitaine and hugdietrich and hildeburg but his introduction though much shorter than we should like it to be gives an interesting analysis of the mythological import of all the stories and helps to prove the wholly mythical character of the vast mass of popular tradition j the study of such traditions in such a way as mr cox adopts and suggests as he truly says  throws a fresh light on the history of the human mind and invests these stories with a deeper nay with an imperishable interest and if comparative mythology while it explains the growth of papular stories shows that their growth was inevitable and that it implies no corruption of the human intellect and no debasement of human affections it will do a work the importance of which can scarcely be exaggerated it will show that the multiplication of these myths was a necessary phase of the education of the world and will impart to the epic narratives into which they have developed a higher and more abiding charm it is hardly necessary that we should review this book at any length ox the versions of the old teutonic stories it is enough to say that they are very carefully and very well translated of the introduction we are bound to say that il is too short to contain much new criticism and perhaps too short properly to inform readers not already instructed in comparative mythology concerning mr coxs views but it is very interesting and suggestive this paragraph concerning the volsung story of fafnir and begin will show how mr cox connects teutonic myths with the myths of other races that like the teutonic race may be referred back to the aryan source and how he finds in all a subtle meaning that is none the less charming because it may not b3 altogether within the region of proof as in the arthur story no sooner are the adventures of one hero ended than another starts up to do the same things over aain or the same series of exploits is being achieved by two or more knights at the same time but the main point to be noticed is that the objects of their career and the mode in which they seek to attain them are always the same and in most cases tell their own tale with a clearness which it is impossible to misapprehend the story of sigmund is in its main features the story of the son who avenges him and sigurds victory is won only with the sword which odin himself had shattered in his fathers hand it is the myth of theseus or of perseus or of many another hero of more southern lands but the myth has been modified to suit the harsher climates of northern europe in both it is the uncouth smith of the gods who forges the weapon by which the solar hero is to smite the dragon or worm of darkness and cold and fafnir answers probably in name as well as in character to the delphian python but there is a hatred between begin and fafnir which we do not find between hephaistos and python the northern myth drew a distinction between the gigantic hrimthursar the powers of frost or the deadly worm which does their work and the dwarfs who like regin represent the wonderful properties of the mineral and vegetable kingdoms the capacity for growth and energy locked up under the surface of the earth hence from begin comes the command which charges sigurd to slay his kinsman fafnir and thus to end their quarrel for the treasures which fafnir had contrived to get into his own keeping the mode by which this antagonism was brought about is among the most significant features of the legend the treasures are the ransom by which odin loki and hahnir the gods of the bright heaven are compelled to purchase their freedom from the sons of reidmar whose brother the otter they have slain by way of atonement they are not only to fill the otters skin with gold but so to cover it with gold that not a white hair upon it shall remain visible  in other words they are to set the earth free from its fetters of ice and so to spread over it the golden sunshine that not a single streak of snow shall be seen npon it they who take up these  tales of the teutonic lands merely for amusement will find the volume as amusing as they could desire more serious readers will find in it an excellent supplement to mr coxs very learned and very attractive treatise on the mythology of the aryan nations e  tales of the teutonic lands by george w cox ma and eustace hinton jones longmans  co we cordially welcome the new volume of popular romancesfor which we are indebted to mr cox and mr hinton jones they are doing right good service in making attractive to every eye the grand old stories which in their original shape are too often treated with indifference and sometimes even inspire repugnance more captivating in shape and style than mr ludlows useful work on  popular epics their volumes ought to find favour with the widening circle of readers who appreciate and enjoy the fiction of antiquity inexpressibly grateful should we be to them and to all workers in similar fields if we could reasonably hope that their efforts would result in a preference being given by the general public to the masterpieces of the past over the puerilities of the presentif we could look forward to a golden time in which our young men and women will reserve their enthusiasm for genuine art setting their faces against impostors of every kind but more especially against such twaddle as is now incessantly shaping itself into three volumes and assuming the name of a novel the present volume commences with the stories of the volsungs followed by the nibelung story to which they gave rise and the legend of walter of aquitaine into which it in its turn was resolved then comes the story of hugdietrich and hildeburg  another version of the tales in which a maiden is shut up in a lonely tower and none can approach her except the knight who is destined to win her this is followed by the gudrun lay that record of the fortunes of one of the fearless maidens who are born to be the cause of strife and warfare and who after long suffering and shameful toil are raised to the glory which is their birthright next in order is the story of frithiof and ingebjorg the tale of the godlike hero whom an unwitting offence compels to wander as an exile over land and sea achieving mighty exploits but ever longing to see once more the maiden from whom he has been parted till the time comes when his crime has been expiated and he wins her as his bride the rest of the volume is devoted to three icelandic tales first among them comes that of grettir the strong with its ghastly vampire horrors and its groups of heroic forms struggling in mortal combat then the story of gunnlaugs adventures in london streets and elsewhere and of helgas lifelong sorrow for his death and lastly the tale of the burning of nj al and his household that lurid picture of wild northern life in the introduction which mr cox has prefixed to these stories their principal characteristics and mutual relations are excellently described and it is remarkable for the modem tion and good sense he displays in it while applying and defending his favourite theory there is comparatively speaking very little in it to excite the ire of the numerous objectors to that solar myth which like the justice of aristides has been rendered unpopular by repeated mention there is much in it which must elicit the full acquiescence of all who have conscientiously explored the borderland between history and fable commencing with some remarks on the recurrence of myths in popular traditions mr cox proceeds to estimate the relative values of the historical and mythical elements in legendary lore we quite agree with him in the conclusion he draws with reference to this subject that  we cannot dig out history from quarries in which history and myth may be mingled together and that the attempt to dig it out will be rewarded by the discovery of something which may look like bones but which we cannot even piece into the skeleton that once upheld a living form as fully are we of his opinion in what he says about the pseudohistorical names in the volsung and nibelung tales every one knows that the heroes of the nibelungenlied have been  mixed up with historical persons of the fourth fifth and sixth centuries  but it is equally well known that they are often mere reflexes of older forms their words frequently are but echoes of earlier utterances if the historical persons of whom mention has been madesiegbert king of austrasia and gundicarius king of burgundy and attila the hun  have no connexion with the heroes of the edda whose names offer so striking a resemblance to theirs they evidently can have but little with those who figure in the nibelungenlied and the natural inference to be drawn from this would seem to be that it is extremely dangerous to attribute an historical basis to a popular tale merely because the names which occur in it are historical but an inference of a very different kind has been drawn from the facts which we have stated by prof mahaffy in his  prolegomena to ancient history according to him the fact that the names of the heroes of the nibelung story not only  appear to correspond to those of the edda but also correspond just as closely to historical personages who lived after the edda was known and referred to in literature proves that  there is an historical basis for this later poem and that therefore all the explanations of the nibelungenlied proposed by the comparative mythologists are false and delusive the extraordinary piece of reasoning by which prof mahaffy arrives at this result is quoted at length by mr cox who then takes the almost unnecessary trouble to refute it controversialists have often been warned against relying on illustrations of their arguments prof mahaffys reasoning was up to a certain point conducted not without skill and the grounds on which it relied were sufficiently sound but the illustration in which it culminated was as dangerous to its maintenance as is too often the final card to a childs pasteboard edifice we utterly refuse to believe in prof mahaffys  historical basis  of the nibelungenlied to identify the actual attila with the fictitious etzel but if he had confined himself to the remarks which in his prolegomena preceded his unhappy illustration we should have found many points on which to agree with him in what he has said about the preference to be given in some cases of mythexplanation to the meteorological over the solar theory we are to a considerable extent of his opinion but no great stress is laid in the volume now before us on myths and their interpretation except in the introduction no attempt is made to prove the solar character of any of the heroes who figure on the stage the stories are left to produce their own effect and we are enabled to gaze upon the pictures they call up before the minds eye without being constantly recalled by coldblooded footnotes from enjoyment to criticism there is a strong human interest in these tales especially in those of which the scene is laid in iceland of which most readers would be loth to be deprived even although they were tendered in exchange any amount of cosmical allegory the science of comparative mythology is to its devotees seductive and engrossing in the extreme but for the world at large it is not likely to possess the interest which attaches itself to stories based on such inexhaustible themes afforded by the adventures of brave men the loves of fair women  tale of the teutonic lands by g w cox ma and e h jonzs london lougmans mr cox continues his work in translating or supervising while another translates the myths of the aryan races into modern english narratives illuminated by modern germanenglish scholarship i use the last words designedly because we are all aware that mr cox derives his special inspiration in the work to which he has so zealously applied himself from the individual teaching of an illustrious german scholar who is an english professor and who first let offif one may say so and with vast effect the conclusions of scientific philology among the ranks of the english learned and unlearned public the force of the impact upon mr cox is unexhausted and he has moved in one line ever since if some students have thought that in applying and developing in reference to the whole system and to all the various systems of the aryan epics romances and fables the law of the solar origin of myths as propounded by professor mix mailerif some have thought that in the execution of this task mr cox has shown a somewhat inelastic spirit no one will charge him with having shown an indolent one a little more play of humour and imagination might not perhaps have been without its fruit even upon the mode of exercise of his scholarship for there is i suppose it may be safely said as little doubt of the truth of the law of solar origin as a positive discovery in the science of religion and language as there is doubt that mr cox has pushed that law too far and tried to unlock with it doors of which it is not the key granting the independent and exclusive solar origin of some primitive myths common to the rc and granting the tendency of other history and legend having its origin in fact to mythicise and arrange itself according to the solar model and so conform to the solar scheme of narrative it is obvious that the nicest discrimination and play of instinct as well as a learning far more extended and a sfing far more thorough than one generation can bring to bear upon the matter will be neededlbefore scholars can part the solar from the nonsolar elements of fable and tell in which lock the key of that particular discovery will turn and in which it will not in mr coxs zeal there would thus seem to have been not enough of patience as well as not enough of humour and elasticity comic journalists have not been slow to point out the latter deficiencies and to show for instance how the facts of napoleons story with his birth from an island of the sea hisdivorce from his first bride his triumphant midcareer his downgoing after wideblazing battle into another island of the western sea is at least as solar in its complexion and details as many of those which mr coxs method explains away out of the field of fact altogether the comic journalist having exhausted this point of view the lover of scholarship may still i think remonstrate against the want of patience understanding patience in quite a different sense from industry with which mr cox has proceeded to try his key in all locks it is true that he does not ignore the contentions of those who criticise him and that in his present volume replying to writers who have evidently exaggerated from the other side he makes much more allowance than he has hitherto seemed willing to make for historical elements falling into the mythical mould but he does not show himself prepared to make much for the play of the inventive faney outside of solar traditions nor yet for elements of mythology and fable imported from nonaryan races theniebelungen lied and the scandinaviancycles the sagas of the volsungs of grettir of frithiof of gudrun and of njal are those with which the new volume is occupied several of these are in the possession of the english reader in literary forms than which nothing better is to be desired and that brings us to another point of criticism against mr cox and his method it is not the most successful method from the literary point of view while xr coxs tales of the greek gods and heroes are assuredly preferable from all points of view to lempriare and his mediaval tales in a less degree of comparison better and more scholarly than a book like mr ludlows  popular epics they neither of them represent the proper and final form which these things ought to wear either for children or their elders they break i think a law of literature literature demands that the faculties of criticism and the faculties of imagination should be addressed separately mr coxs method of telling stories has tried to address them both together it tried to keep the narrative interest of the stories and at the same time to couch them in phrases that shall continually keep the solar origin of them before the mind and make you remember that you are hearing not of people that lived but of the sun the dawn the noon evening and sunset it tries this and it fails the story becomes tedious thus semitransparently clothed in a terminology of the atmospheric phenomena the question of original signification and the question of narrative interest ought i repeat to be kept apart the modes by which we ought to possess these ancient cycles for our modern uses are two eitherthat of exact and faithful translation3 without criticalafterthought from each inone or another of its ancient forms or else by poetical and sympathetic revivification in the ancient spirit alile without afterthought as in the work of mr morris thoselmodes for them in their live use for our ig t the most rigorous methods of philo l ogical analysis in they description and classification for our uderstanding the one when we want to enjoy themthe other when we want to know about them but not the two together not though to say so seems ungrateful to the learning and toil of one of the most zealous and ingenious of workers this union by which a somewhat premature science is yoked to a somewhat disenchanted poetry and that grumble over it is fair to say that in these condensations by mr cox and mr jones of the teutonic major and minor epics and sagas the anatomy is much less displayed the solar terminology very much less brought into view than in former ones of the hellenic cycle,folklore

we must leave to be told in mr lemons owvn words the scene of the story we should observe is laid in the reign of good king horsa when the fairies may be supposed to have had it nearly all their own way in the forest and woodlands of the west saxons we will only add that a summer day in tilgate forest is a very pleasant thing indeed but we think our young friends in the schoolroom will almost prefer a few hours of the holidays in the company of tinykin and mr markl lemon whose imagi native powers have found mr charles green an admirable interpreter in the chronicles of the three sisters which follow next we have the story of a  noble baron who shows his nobility by squandering away his money and estates and living like a prince and who is profoundly dissatisfied with the domestic management of his wvife and daughters and accordingly getting into all sorts of troubles he sees two of his three daughters married to a bear and an eagle respectively while a huge sea monsterwe can hardly call him a fishruns off with the mniru and tney pass into a state which to say the least is not that of ave rage humanity however the3 are won back to their larents by a younger brother rinaldo who isborn grows up to manhood dons the arms of knighthood and sallies forth upon adventures the end of the story is thus tolda whole year passed away in sports and festivities at last the princes considered that a continuance of these indulgences would enervate the courage and activity of their knights and squires the three sonsinlaw therefore with their ladies took their departure for their respective homes riccaldo the heir of the family never quitted his parents and at last like a pious son closed their eyes albert the bear bought the domain of ascania and founded the city bernberg edgar the eagle retired to switzerlandunder the shadow of the lofty alps and founded eagleton on the banks of a river which had then no name but is now called after the city by which it glides ugo the dolphin undertook an expedition into burgundy conquered part of that kingdom and named it dauphin6 and as the three princes in the names of their cities and states alluded to the circumstance of their enchantment they also took their own enchanted shapes for the devices of their arms thence bernberg carries a bear with a golden crowr eagleton an eagle and dauphine a fish as a device to this day it should be added that for a profusion of graceful illustrations this story is indebted to the pencil of air c h bennett the third story that of the enchanted doll has tow additional claims on our attention firstly it teaches a high moral lesson that of checking all envious feelings an secondly its scene is laid in london partly at  kilboune near the old priory there and partly in the city how the gift of an enchanted doll is made the vehicle of conveying this lesson to a selfish and grasping londoner we will leave mr mark lemon to tell our readers in his own words for fear that his publishers should think that wve have been poaching on his and their manor and preserves we owe them our best thanks for allowving us to transfer to our pages two of the illustrations of this beautiful and really charming volume viz that of the fairies dancing in a ring round their beloved queen  from tinvkins tranformations by mr c green and that of the enchanted doll being shaped into form by a swann of little fairies in the artists workshop it is quite a masterpiece in it way and equal to anything that we have seen ven from the pencil of ar richard doyle the special artist of the fairies and fairyland  fairy tales by hans christian andersen illustrated by e v b london sampson low marston low and searle every one is now more or less acquainted with andersens delightful tales in which the fantastic the poetical and the grotesque are blended with such artistic harmony but few are prepared to see the selection of eight of the prettiest stories in the splendid binding fine text and original illustrations of this truly handsome volume the twelve large chromolithographs are treated in the bright and somewhat crude colouring which has latterly been so much en vogme and seems at this season of the year especially to supersede the quieter woodcuts and engravings of former days the quaintness of this florid style is however peculiarly adapted to the subject it is most conspicuous in the picture of the wicked princess in her garden which is almost weird in its conception so much so indeed that it all but precludes the possibility of its being intended to grace a childs book not so the one of the  children playing in the water which is full of life and grace while the two interiors of the  ugly duckling and the  witch combing gerdas hair have quite a flemish finish of detail on the whole we incline to believe that the  fairy tales is more a drawingfoom album than a volume for little people whose meddlesome fingers should not be allowed to dogear its handsome pages although no doubt a glimpse of its bright beauties would be an exquisite treat as they could not fail to recognise their old friends in their brilliant new christmas garb  faint tales eooks ron childuint by mark lemon with upwards of fifty illustrations by richard doyle and charles h bennett bradbury evans  co mr lemon has already ventured among the fairies and stood on enchanted ground he has made two more journeys in the same direction and to little people of mortal mould gives the fruits of bis experience or of his invention yet not entirely of either for his first story the chronicles of the three sisters is from the german the original author of it was not much of a conjurer if there is any moral in the story which shows how three daughters of a baron came to marry a bear an eagle and a fish and that these turned out to be princes it is that sonsinlaw may not be such beasts as they look the grandest piece of magic in the story is at the service of every individual who may stand in need of it and a knowledge thereof may be profitable to many a person suffering froma baroness indulging in bitterest reproaches the baron had recourse to his invariable practice in all conjugal altercations and observed a profound silence suffer ing the lady to proceed until she was tired mr lemon does not say whether his second story the enchanted doll is original or overset from the german he does however very soon settle a point in fairy chronology for he tells us that the story    happened years ago long before the fairies had left us as we find that tony stubbs one of the characters distinguished for his ability in chasing gold and silver  had gone over the sea as far as florence to study in the workshop of the great benvenuto cellini we learn that the fairies were alive and active at least as late as the middle of the sixteenth century be this as it may the enchanted doll is a better story than  the chronicle of the three sisters and it may teach a good many of us how to get rid of the very black doll which sorely besets some men,folklore
  old english fairy tales collected by s baring gould illustrated by f d bedford methuen the advantage that mr baring goulds collection has over others of the kind is that he has newer that is older stories to tell we are sure that at least half this volume will be new to every reader today who is not a student of folklore the conclusion to be drawn is not that he has told the ones that were not good enough to survive in popular favour the stories here are enthralling besides having the delight of novelty about them they are of the good old brand only some wear their likeness with a difference and that difference is in many caes a greater poetical distinction which seems to belong to the essentials of the tales rather than to their treatment lhe editor has had his will with them joining several together and introducing the episodes of one into another that seemed to want filling up but if you want to know the extent of his interference you need only turn to his notes  southernwood the shepherd of salisbury plain  desideratus and  he crown of white roses may be confidently tried on children and the heart is old indeed that does not warm to them we like mr bedfords pictures,folklore

tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he affects to adopt the opinions of duchinski about the great russian race he looks for the sources of his tales in any other direction at least two of the pieces given by miss hodgetts are russian bilini or legendary ballads the last of the russian warriors  and the celebrated chant of ilya muromets whose name is somewhat disguised in the form which it assumes in her book this ulina is interesting as giving us a glimpse how vladimir the first christian sovereign presented himself to the popular imagination in russia strange to say we find next to nothing about him in his religious character if we except his contest with the idolater ilya is the most popular hero of the old yolksepos vladimir is holding high court at sacred kiev  elie ilya galloped straight into the princes court jumped off his noble steed and tied bim up to an old oakpost this done he went to the sacred avieuomu bright p palace of the prince to pray and after having offered np thanks for his recovery he made a low bow to the prince and princess now the great prince vladimir was holding a feast there were princes and grand nobles present and many a valiant warrior when lie muromitch lija marorxtets had finished praying a mighty bowl large as a modern pail was handed to him foll of green wine elie ilya took the bowl and raisirg it to bis lips drank off the contents at one draught then up rose the great prince vladimir sud spoke for be and his people were greatly amazed 44 tell me thy name young strang9r tell me thy fathers name that we may know what seat to give thee this quaffing the bowl of wine will perhaps t mind some of our readers of a passage in the frithof saga ej tvenne miin debt tomde some manner aro nu  not two strong men in these new days could drain that mighty cup lt will be observed that the wine is green the favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious stories we can only say that for

familiar with trie works of afanasiev rudclenko kulish eilenvein and others know how many there aremiss hodgetts has translated those which are most representative she gives them in free racy

tales and traditions of hungaiy by francis and there  colbnm pulszky three vols colburn this book claims more attention than is ordinarily ri to books of its class such is the fluency and correctness nay even the nicety and felicity of stylewith which 1 and madame pulszky write the english language that merely in this respect the tales here collected form a curious study but they contain also highly suggestive illustration i national literature and character to not a few of tb 44 traditions of hungary a living force and significance i still imparted by the practises as well as the belief of he peasantry and people and none were better qualified thu the authors of this book to give familiar and pointed eiprbsion to these national traits we should be disposed to doubt from the specimens here given whether the popular imagination of hungary had mt highly fanciful or creative element in it the traditions which we should call the most purely imaginative we per ceive to be borrowed from other lands but aspects rf social and political life are vividly reflected in the hunjjario legends the pride and power of the landed noble is contrast with the more gaudy but less real power of the courtthe continual struggles of the classes in immediate proximity with the nobleand that fancy so peculiar ta rude ages in every country the calling in of the comma robber to redress the unequal social balanceare the prominent subjects of the traditions related by madaoe pulszky with much beauty aud vivacity the tale or tradition which holds a middle place betieei these and the purely fantastic is that which describes tie home life of the peasant and at the same time satisfies dr love of distant adventure which he cultivates as he folloa his plough the original of this tradition called  yann the hero exists in many forms but the copy here selected for translation is by a modern poet written in rhymed tent and full of idyllic pictures madame pulzsky has rendered j it in blank

  japanese fairy tales i green willow and other japanese fairy tales by grace james with forty illustrations in colour by warwick goble macmillan and co lbs net japan is a country that has borrowed much in the way of fairy tales from china and india it is not however a crude borrowing and nothing more a mere change of the names of places and people japanese fairy tales have a distinct charm of their own and they are as remote from our  little riding hood  or the pomp and ciri cumstance of the  arabian nights  as can possibly be imagined many fairy tales of nippon owe their origin to a fanciful love of nature the willow with its drooping shower of delicate leaves becomes a beautiful woman living only so long as the willow tree lives the wind in the pine trees becomes the happy murmur of lovers voices such tales are essentially japanese though akin to the naturecumfairyland stories of other countries it is a gentle and easy transition from the obvious to the fanciful in which for example the deep red of azaleas becomes the fire of the gods or the white snow about the summit of fuji the discarded garments of the heavenly ones in sharp contrast to such poetical ideas we have stories of the weird and the horrible stories of amorous foxwomen who must be exorcised by holy priests then there are tales of rollicking humour in which a kettle performs on the tightrope talks and laughs or the more subtle merriment in the tale of a rat who offers his daughter in marriage first of all to the sun and then to the wind cloud wall and discovers in the end that the best thing to do with his daughter is to marry her to another rat the excellent idea had not occurred to him before this story is a delightful parody on matchmaking generally on those people who must needs plot and scheme for marriage in impossible and undesirable quarters and last of all there is that element which is common to fairy stories the world over the element of high adventure and deeds of extraordinary daring centring in japan in the beloved momotaro and the fortyseven ronin we have had many volumes of japanese fairy tales mitford hearn ozaki griffis and chamberlain have given us the very cream of this fascinating subject and now just in time for christmas miss grace james has joined the goodly company of her predecessors in the field miss jamiess book would have been a little superfluous were it not that she has presented her collection of old favourites such as  urashima  the moon maiden and  the star loivers with a number of very charming coloured illustrations by mr warwick goble the artists work is for the most part extremely clever he has in his treatment of sea followed hokusais wellknown method of portraying wave and foam his most pleasing production is that illustrating  reflections though we doubt in another picture depicting a sevenheaded serpent if the great monster could possibly drink from the very diminutive jars so temptingly displayed beneath him author and artist are not in agreement in the story entitled  the black bowl the maiden of the story wears a black bowl in which we are at first told that all the beauty of her face is concealed later we are informed that tears  rolled down her cheeks and reached her white chin they looked so charming that a strolling player on seeing them improvised a song for the occasion the artist no doubt troubled with such inconsistencies decides to go his own way and paint a bowl very much resembling our scuttle hat under which we see contrary to the original japanese story the whole of the maids very charming face the bowl was quite unmovable by natural means several of the bowl maidens friends tried to remove it with the result that they merely succeeded in giving the unfortunate wearer a very bad headache only when the maiden drank the three times three with her future husband did the bowl break asunder and obligingly scattered around a shower of gold and precious stones we are afraid mr gobles bowl would have been blown away by a little puff of wind miss jamess manner of treating these stories is not all that could be desired she has not followed the recognised originals very closely and sometimes the use of such a word as  petticoat  obviously strikes a wrong note  give me my best brocade gown and i will get up for i feel a good deal better is rather a tame ending to the droll story of a monkey who preferred to keep his liver rather than to offer it as a medicine to the sick dragon queen but there is room for licence in the telling of a fairy tale and apart from a certain laxity here and there we are glad to welcome these stories again the volume is most tastefully produced and though we may look in vain for snow at christmas time those of us who still preserve something of the heart of a child will thrill at the presence of the snow lady who was white and dazzling to look upon and yet pressed her icy lips to human beings and sucked their blood vampirefashion we have read variations of  the peony lantern  a good many times but miss jamess rendering must take a high place in the manner of telling she has told this story with admirable skill and it is as beautiful and charming as mr gobles picture of the weaving maiden clad in blue and green holding a lighted lantern in her hand and stepping over a bridge of magpies that flutter their black and white wings amid a great gathering of silverpointed stars,folklore

she had often played before and xvent out into the wood and in the middle of the wood there xvas a bright cool brook and by the side of this she sat herself doxvn threxv the ball up into the air and caught it again  and this xvas to her as a pastime but it happened once xvhen the ball had floxxn very high and the princess lifted up her arm and stretched out her lingers that she might catch it that the ball fell upon the ground by the side of her and rolled staightxvays into the xvater the princess xvas frightened and looked after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy jewels thy pearls even thy golden crown itself are nothing to me  but if thou wilt take me for thy friend and companion set me on  we have not ottered an opinion on that part ol mr bulwers work which treats ol literature haviptt reserved hi views on thc subject sui a second notice thy right hand at thy little tallie j let nie eat with thee out of thy little golden dish drink with thee out of thy little cup and sleep in thy little bed i will get thee thy golden ball again how the princess thought in her heart  how this silly frog prattles  a frog is no companion for such as me hut must remain in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all her might j against it saying  now you xviii have rest enough you

we like the flight to be high vast profound and wonderful all this we find in thc little volume before us so much do we revel in the marvellous of these tales that we really begrudge mr thoms the space that he occupies with his very erudite comparisons and analogies between the various fairy tales of all nations the more especially as these fictions must be nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear out of the chapter of curses so

russia ti folk ta les saturday june 28 4873 i   lr literature i jj russian folklore by w r s ralston smith elder  co mk ralston has once more made his appearance before the british public in his now familiar character of interpreter of russian folklore and we tender him our cordial thanks for this his latest work mr ralston displays more than ever thoroughness and ease in dealing with the vast and multifarious material at hand wide reading and great industry in the comparative study of folklore he loves his subject and his style and mode of interpretation are not only scholarly but attractive his present book will be as entertaining to the child as it will be interesting to the antiquarian and useful to the student as our knowledge of russian folklore stands at present mr ralstons books are for us english standard works and yet we believe that he has in store for us other volumes of a still more ambitious character hitherto his contributions have been what the germans term vorarbeiten materials stored together and arranged and digested to form the basis of a future work on the whole subject scientifically worked out last year we had his  songs of the russian people now we have the tales and besides several classes or groups of tales which the author has excluded from the present volume we are promised a work on the builinas the epic poems or metrical romances of the russians there is one extremely remarkable though a negative feature about the russian popular tales as compared with those of western europeantheir utter silence with regard to elves and dwarfs the elfin world which in western europe may be said to be the other world so to speak of the popular fancy and has been so fruitful a source of fantastic imaginings to teutons and scandinavians is a world entirely unknown to the russian perhaps the westeuropean literature of elfinanddwarf story owes its origin to a prehistoric struggle between two races of man the one perishing the other settling down on the formers ruin  dwarfs being a highly civilised race possessing knowledge of precious as well as base metals and adepts in mining elves being an agricultural and fishing race having their abodes in earthen holes in hills and knolls and both of them being far too weak to resist the brute force of the invader the existence of dwarfs in scandinavian folklore is anterior to the creation of thc human race that of elves coeval with the gods it is remarkable to observe how owing to the enormous length of time that these stories have been on the lips of the people the beings to which they relate have gradually come to figure as personifications of folly and boorishness alfr in icelandic is now the everyday word for fool and dur jr another form of dvergr invariably means a wrongheaded clownishlooking lout these remarks concerning elves and dwarfs may serve to prepare the way to the russian dur ak or ninny we are inclined to think that durak may be durgr dvergr dwarf but the russian storytellers have no idea of him as a dwarf but know him only as a human goiok an incorrigible blockhead in the story about the durah and the birchtree however the insight into the bowels of the earth which belongs to the genuine dwarf is strikingly illustrated without the sagatellers dreaming of the durah being anything but an ordinary fool born with a silver spoon in his mouth we venture to ask therefore is durah a genuine russian word to begin with and is the durah known in russian storytelling only as a fool and nothing else  for our part we think the durahs temper and ways of dealing with difficulties of life and facing danger have a scandinavian turn about them but then it i3 to be born in mind that stories of this class are remarkably similar in all countries from this negative characteristic which of course opens a large field for inquiry we turn to the more positive qualities of the literature represented in mr ralstons volume in form the shazhas have a peculiar finish  they have a tendency throughout to repeat certain words after the manner of a refrain at certain stages of the story the style is somewhat epigrammatic and the arrangement is strongly marked by a turn for dramatic grouping precision and surprises if these peculiarities of the outer form of the shazha are genuinely inherent in the oral tradition of the russian peasant and folktale teller we are inclined to think the russians surpass all europeans in the form of their folklore the inner mental qualities of the stories are not less attractive a general calm seems to pervade the whole there is little of passion to be traced even in situations where it might be looked for as in the beautiful story of  woe where the poor brother being invited by his wealthy brother sits quiet starving a whole evening while the rich is enjoying with merry guests the contents of his overladen table and then without receiving a morsel the poor man bids his rich brother a loving farewell when the party breaks up a patient spirit of resignation and a quiet hope for better things are perpetually reflected in these tales but beside a delicacy of feeling tenderness of affection and sweetness of temper are exhibited which no other folktales so far as we know express so strikingly the humour too of a russian folktale is russian only and belongs to no other country it is quiet almost stealthy throughout there goes hand in hand with the clear style a clear definition of the events accidents persons or preternatural beings which figure in the tale and constitute its dramatic movement as their poetry so are also the tales of the russians entirely or almost entirely free from any point or climax artistically wrought out in some the point is that they have no climax although the natural turn of the story may seem to require it a peculiarity which detracts in no degree from the interest of the story it is a matter of course that these tales throw a good deal of light upon the daily life of the russian people therein they have however nothing primitive or original about them beyond tales from other countries having thus dealt with the generalities which have struck us the most we now turn to a more minute examination of mr ralstons work in a short preface pp ixii our author gives a brief review of the sources of his present book of which the chief are asanief 8 volumes of over 3000 pages containing no less than 332 distinct tales besides variations in some instances amounting to five of one and the same story of his treatment of these sources mr ralston gives us the following account  the fiftyone stories which i have translated at length i have rendered as literally as possible in the very rare instances in which i have found it necessary to insert any words by way of explanation i have except in case of such additions as  he said or the like enclosed them between brackets in giving summaries also i have kept closely to the text and always translated literally the passages marked as quotations the bulk of the book pp 1378 mr ralston divides into six chapters  i introductory and illustrative of various social tenets and striking manifestations in mans moral and mental life ii mythological exhibiting the principal incarnations of evil such as the snake the stealer of daylight norha a being somewhat similar to the nechen of sweden and norway koshcliei the deathless whose span of life depends on a certain egg being left unbroken the hag dabayaga and the witch iii contains miscellaneous impersonations impersonifications we take to be a printers slip of mythological import which mr ralston illustrates by a story of the oneeyed lihho a mere imitation of the story of polyphemus a story of woe the poor mans companion stories about friday wednesday and sunday about the wooddemon leshy and certain rivers about frost as wooer of maidens and about morfei and oh two supernatural beings we doubt whether any of these stories with perhaps the exception of leahys morfeys and ohs can at all be referred to a mythological category the stories about wednesday friday and sunday are clearly christian compositions in a popular form intended to enforce upon people proper regard for the holiness of those three days of the week the river stories seem to us all to bear quite a modern impress of poetic not mythic personification as does also that about frost a most charming story all the same chapter iv contains stories relating to magic and witchcraft among which we may name stories of the waters of life and death and of strength and weakness  stories about aid given to children by dead parents stories of magic horses fish kc about wizards and witches about a headless princess midnight watches over corpses ive chap v contains ghost stories and chap vi legends of saints and demons the book finishes with a capital index pp 379382 we cannot refrain from devoting a little space to some of the more prominent features of these chapters which are made up on the whole of stories of a remarkably high type so far as construction goes and form a digest of comparative folklore of a valuable kind the following tender story reminds us somewhat of the borderballad of the bad stepmother although it is not the same story and is probably entirely unconnected with the ballad in a certain village a husband and wife lived happily lovingly peaceably all their neighbours envied them the mistress bare a son but directly after it was born she died the poor moujik moaned and wept above all he was in despair about the babe how was he to nourish it now  how to bring it up without its mother  he did what was best and hired an old woman to look after it all day long the babe would take no food and did nothing but cry there was no soothing it but during the greater part of the night one might fancy it was not there at all so silently and peacefully did it sleep  what is the meaning of this 1 thought the old woman  suppose i keep awake tonight maybe i shall find out at midnight she heard some one quietly open the door and go up to the cradle the baby became still just as if it was being suckled the next night the same thing took placo and the third night too then the woman told the nioujik about it he called his kinsfolk together and took counsel with them they determined to keep awake on a certain night and to see who it was that came to suckle the babe so in the evening they all lay down on the floor and beside them they set a lighted taper hidden in an earthen pot at midnight the cottagedoor opened some one stepped up to the cradle the baby became still at that moment one of the kinsfolk suddenly brought out the light they looked and saw the dead mother in the very same clothes in which she had been buried on her knees beside the cradle over which she bent as she suckled the baby at her dead breast the moment the light shone in the cottage she stood up gazed sadly on her little one and then went out of the room without a sound not saying a word to any one all those who saw her stood for a time terrorstruck and when they recovered themselves they found the babe was dead the russian seems never to be at a loss when he wants to point a moral the avarice of the russian clergy is dwelled upon at length the great social vice of russia drunkenness although leniently dealt with in the folklore upon the whole because it affords a sort of soothing selfforgetfulness to a struggling suffering and oppressed race is made the subject of the most formidable moralising in one of the tales before us which is but typical of a large class of stories of a similar kind the punishment inflicted on au incorrigible drunkard is to serve in the abode of the condemned as a draghorse to carry wood and water from the beautiful story of woe we seem almost at liberty to infer that the typical curse of a hapless russian is his helpless fondness for the pothouse and it is evident that the storysteller has a keen sense of the evil although its magnitude seems rather to blunt the edge of his satire but no social vice seems really to rouse russian indignation so much as mean avarice murki the stingy rich merchant is a choice type of the genus miser as marko went along the road close on his heels tramped a poor nioujik they passed a beggar who begged for a copeck the merchant passed him heedlessly but the poor nioujik gave him a copeck marko bethought him returned and begged the moujik to lend him a copeck for the beggar pleading want of change at the moment the debt was to be paid on the morrow but it was the same story over again marko had no change moujik must come another time he came  the result was the same again at the end of a fortnight the debt was to be paid moujik came marko ordered his wife to strip him lay him under the holy pictures and say he died that morning  the kingdom of heaven be his said the moujik if you will allow me mistress in return for my copeck i ll do him the last servicejust give his mortal remains a wash so saying he laid hold of a pot full of boiling water and began pouring its scalding contents over marko the rich marko his brows knit his legs contorted was scarcely able to hold out writhe away or not as you please thought the poor man but pay me my copeck  next marko the rich was put into a coffin and the poor moujik took it to the church where he read psalms over it the darkness of night came on all of a sudden a window opened and a party of lobbers crept through it into the church the nioujik hid himself behind the altar as soon as the robbers had come in they began dividing their booty and after everything else had been shared there remained over and above a golden sabre  each one laid hold of it himself none would give up his claim to it out jumped the poor man crying   what is the good of disputing that way let the sabre belong to him who will cut this corpses head off up jumped marko the rich like a madman the robbers were frightened out of their wits flung away their spoil and scampered off here moujik said marko  lets divide the money they divided it equally between them  each of the shares was a large one  but how about the copeck 1 asked the poor mau  ah brother   replied marko surely you can see i have got no change  and so marko the rich never paid the copeck after all the mythological stories embodied in the present volume are the most genuinely russian mr ralston could find he informs us that the materials are here very large the chief actors in these stories are on the part of man a prince or some other individual who is most hopelessly indolent and by various changes of fortune performs superhuman deeds such is ivan popyalof the wretched youth who spends his early life in the heap of ashes on the hearth among the supernatural beings is the snake a vague and shifty essence now a cloud now a reptile then again blending together the ophidian and human nature and sometimes even resolving into a young galant the terrible norka is another koshchei the deathless a third with a host of other beings male and female among the latter the babayaga is not the least prominent in the story of ivan popyalof a singular parallelism is traceable between the hero and the eddaic slayer of the dragon fafnir sigurd just as sigurd has a sword made for him which fails twice to be of avail for the purpose in view so ivan has a mace made which twice fails to prove suitable for his purpose sigurd slays the dragon and ivan kills the snake in the story again of the monster norka the otterand otter be it not forgotten whom the gods in the edda slew slumbering on a river bank was a brother to the dragon fafnir whom sigurd slewthe hero is most effectually aided by a magic horse just as sigurds wonderworking horse grani stands him best in stead in his exploits there are many parallelisms with northern myths in the mythological talesa fact which rather tempts us to establish a traditional connexion between russian and scandinavian mythology but there ia one consideration against it the points of similarity are all confined to stray incidents but never so far as we can make out extend to the general drift of any story or in other words no scandinavian myth seems to find a repetition in russian mythology in its entirety or even so far as the point of it is concerned incidents which point to this eddaic myth or thatwe confine ourselves to the edda which is the real source of all westeuropean mythologymay be of scandinavian origin or may not we know as yet far too little of the prehistoric migrations of the myth to be able to pronounce positively on the matter all we can say is that there being a variety of identical and similar points in scandinavian and russian mythology that fact enlarges vastly the interest of these tales and of mr ralstons book in the stories about magic and witchcraft the russian people display a great versatility of imagination the witch in russia is no lovelier than elsewhere her hatred of the living seems even more unreasonable than is often the case in witchstories from other lands she is as fiendishly disposed towards him or her with whom she has had no sinister dealings in life as towards those for whom she has contracted a debt of eternal hatred one capital way of getting out of the pursuit of witches in russia is to run backwards the footprints pointing them in a direction opposite to that in which the pursued one is going many of these witchstories are thrilling although of course morbid in the story of the origin of cornbrandy we learn how a poor nioujik who has seven children to find bread for went one day into the fields to plough taking with him the only morsel of crust that was left in the house having toiled a while he was going to eat the bit of bread when he bethought himselfwhy did i not leave this crust for my children  he then put it aside and presently a little demon stole up to him and carried it away after searching in vain for it for a long time the moujik said  god be with him who took it the little demon ran off to the devil and cried  grandfather i have stolen uncle sidors bread well what did he say i  he said god be with him  be off with you says the devil  hire yourself to him for three years for three years the imp served the moujik and taught him to make cornbrandy but at last isidore the moujik fell into a deep drunken sleep from this he was roused by the imp whereupon he exclaimed in a rage  go to the devil and straightway the demon disappeared we must now take leave of this fascinating volume

wideawake stories a collection of tales told by little children between sunset and 8unrise in the panjab and kashmir by f a steel and r c temple bombay education societys press london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the thief in consequence of his too grasping stipulation loses both eyes falls into a well and is drowned nos 3139 give in a readable form a number of the stories about raja rasalu the chief legendary

two indian storybooks i folktales of kaeknmir by the rev j i hinton knowles triibner folklore in southern india by pandit s m na6a siistii bombay education societys press london trubner whatever may be the origin of the popular myths and fictions which are found to be almost identical in all parts of the worldwhether those of simple forms have not been independently developed or invented by different races and those of more complicated construction diffused from a common centre or centresit is not for lack of materials that comparative mythologists and traditionists fail to agree she folklore and folktales of nearly all the eastern and great part of the western hemisphere have now been diligently collected and published and it may be questioned whether there can be much still left for future gleaners that will throw any new light upon the vexed question of the origin and diffusion of popular tales the  solar or  nature  myth theory seems now to be welinigh obsolete and the  anthropological  is rapidly gaining adherents yet there is much to be reasonably said in support of the theories of the socalled benfey schoolof the indian origin of many oral as well as written european fictions it is not however my present business to discuss this question anew but to offer some remarks on the two storybooks whose titles head this article mr knowles is a most intelligent and industrious collector of folktales current in the  happy valley  and he has improved as a storyteller since he published his dictionary of fishuri proverb8 and saying8perhaps improved rather too much since among other ornamental touches we occasionally meet with in this new book such g p r jameslike expressions as the next morning the king mnight have been seen c which is altogether out of place in a foitale and such as this  the quickly found lovers referring to a king meeting a strange wandering damsel and forthwith taking her to wife he is fond of using native terms when the english equivalents would do quite as well or even better since they would save readers the trouble of looking at the foot of the page or in the glossary for their meaning for instance on p 11 the term woni occurs and on referring to the glossary we learn that it means a shopkeeper moreover his planor want of a regular plan ratherof explaining such words is extremely annoying some being explained in footnotes others in the glossary for no apparent reason and some not at all they should all be explained either in one place only or in both places in the preface mr knowles expresses a hope that his work will be useful to students of comparative folklore from the notes he has appended referring to certain other collections where similar tales are to be found but unfortunately most of these works and they are few after all are also indian storybooks of precisely the same kind as his own comprising tales communicated by word of mouth such as miss freres old deccan days and miss stokess indian fairy tale and others are all but absolutely inaccessible in this country such 4s the indian antiquary and indian notes and queriestwo most excellent and useful1 journals which ought to be found in every one of our larger public libraries but enough of faultfinding the collection is a very good one the tales are with one or two trifling exceptions highly entertaining and i shall glance at a number of them ia the story of  all for a panqa a father in order to test his sons mental ability gives him a small coin and bids him get for i five thingssomething to eat to drink to gnaw to sow in the garden and to serve as food for the cow and a clever girl advises him to buy a watermelon there is a somewhat sirnilir story in the talmud of a man who gave a boy a pruta telling him to buy with it something that he might eat leave and take home and the shrewd urchin brought him a quantity of salt in the same kashmiri tale the noodlehero falls into the toils of a gambling courtesan who always wins by her trained cat at the right time overturning the lamp this occurs in one of the legends of the renowned rtijd rastili found in c4pl r c temples valuable legends of the panj46 and also in the

turkish fairy tales and folk tales collected by dr ignacz kurios translated from the hungarian version by r nisbet bain illustrated by celia levetus 6s lawrence and bullen scientific folks have examined these stories gathered by dr kunos from turkish peasants in anatolia and found their resemblance and affinity to oriental and slavonic tales but to most readers they are practically new in incident and very new in tone and atmosphere conventions they use in common with all folktales but theirs are quite unfamiliar to us westerns here is a form that occurs over and over again with slight variations to express remoteness of time and place once upon a time in days long gone by when my father was my father and i was my fathers son when my father was my son and 1 was my fathers ir other once upon a time i say at the uttermost ends of the world hard by the realm of demons stood a great city this is impressive but the stories are all impressive some of them grim all of them daring in invention rapid and vigorous in narration with here and there a strain of peculiar tenderness that surprises and touches as in the devotion of the brother to his sister in the goldenhaired children and his indefatigable efforts to satisfy her unreasonable desires the beauty of imagery and phrase and fancy has not been lost by the translator every now and again a passage arrests us as a lyric or a picture wouldthat description for instance in the wind demon of the old man with the black globe and the white whose business was his bane for he  held fast the nights and let go the days the tales would impress a child by their vividness but there is an intricacy of meaning and now and then a subtlety of poetry that a child would let slip to us older folks unless we have dipped often into the stream of oriental and eastern european folk lore they offer a new taste they are full of savour and surprise and what is no disadvantage they provide a few knotty puzzles interesting if as in the case of stone patience and knife patience probably insoluble turkish costume and circumstance have been used very effectively in the illustrations from  turkish fairy tales lawrence and bullen,folklore
