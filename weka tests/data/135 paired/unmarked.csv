from generation to generation by lady augusta nod author of qwandering willie owen gwynnes great work c macmillan and coif this story had been written by an anonymous author we venture to assert that it would hardly have met with the favourable notices which have been devoted to it in journals not generally celebrated for special leniency it contains vivid pictures of scotch life and some happy sketches of scotch scenery but the tale is harrowing and melancholy and the introductory genealogy is as unsatisfactory as it is intricate there is of course in the old family of douglas a traditional prophecy and the prophecy is fulfilled in a manner which no one except all those who have read novels could possibly expect while blackcock shooting in a wood  kenneth douglas shoots lord douglas accidentally his cousin ronald is accused of the homicide by an old keeper and kenneth is afraid of confessing the truth poor ronald is under the imputation of having shot his father and his stern mother cannot forgive him he becomes however engaged to his cousin marion the only one besides the old keeper who knows that kenneth was the unfortunate youth guilty of the fatal shot  and the latter loving her accepts it as a punishment of his cowardice that she should be engaged to his cousin finally however everything is cleared up the engagement is broken off and all ends well this novel which is fortunately in two volumes only is fairly well written and sufficiently interesting but life is not merry enough to make us approve of a work so eminently calculated to depress ones exuberant spirits  fm t  ra ajz to cwlz ralik i vo1 by fjs auigustus i i i right i wc 1o not think very much of this story any way but ncvcrtheless one cannot help liking the author and feeling goodnatured towards her book she is so evidently a novice and anxious to please that one would be a churl indeed not to make the best of it to ones self there are some bright and fairly ielldrawn scenes too but mrs bright has not put her story well together we think she might try again and do better by the way two girls talk of a young man and say  all the same he would make a charming spoon does mrs bright know the meaning of the last word  we think not but perhaps her ignorance is to her credit,unmarked
the bandolero or a marriaae amona the moun tains by capt main reid bentley although capt main reid has written some good books for boys and we of maturer age have been able to take interest in the stirring adventures which were not intended for us we must confess that the present work whether written for boys men or women is a lamentable failure plot and incidents are of the stalest description the story consists of various attempts at murder and one or two attempts at marriage there is a young american who sees a mexican lady on her balcony and falls desperately in love with her there is a young mexican who is in love with a lady living in the same house and appearing on the same balcony the american is alternately jealous of the mexican and his most devoted friend while the attempts at murder alternate with much the same regularity as the swing of a pendulum first the mexican saves the american then the american saves the mexican  and then in the act of saving the american the mexican is saved by him similarly the american first mistakes his loves sister for his love then he mistakes bis love for her sister and then he mistakes his love for herself like the traditional irishman who ended by finding it was neither of us capt main reids only excuse is that the reader is quite as much puzzled as the hero could have been the reader can never make out why the young american should always mistake the two sisters just when it was the authors interest to prolong the story and the conclusion is so abrupt that the reader does not know whether the mystery is solved at last and whether the american and mexican get the right ladies capt main reid reminds us of the clergyman who married several couples at once and then finding he had not been so particular in sorting them as they could have wished told them to make it all right among them yet wear doing injustice to capt main reids wonderful powers of language in comparing him to an english clergyman the quantity of spanish phrases scattered over the volume would alone qualify the gallant captain for a consulship in spain or a professorship at oxford no civil service commissioner could resist the tide of queridos and ranchos and bandoleros and salteadores and va mos aud pesos and puentes and pordios and vs nor would the effect on oxford be less strikiug we feel confident that the professor of greek would throw his arms wide open to embrace a caudidate who had beeu soured by meeting with a heartless flirt and who proclaimed himself  almost a gynothrojie this astonishing effort of constructive philology is to be found at p 88 of  the bandolero to which we refer any readers who may doubt our veracity capt main reid almost deserves to be canonised for inventing such a word,unmarked
  a wild proxy by mrs w k clifford hutchinson this is surely an early and very immature work of mrs clifford it bears traces here and there of the hand of a clever writer but not of the hand that made  aunt anne the story is too wild to rouse any feeling but impatience and merreday the end of the nineteenth century rochestercumbyron who talks poetic rubbish and cheap cynicism all in a breath and who wishing to act the demon only plays the fool is a nightmare the worst of it is that mrs clifford keeps serious in his presence  a wild proxy by mrs w k clifford hutchinson fit uoj granted that the situation mrs clifford has hit upon in a wild proxy is strikingly original and that the riskiness of the story is minimised by the breathless rapidity of its action we must confess that the tale fails to convince us of its reality which was never the case with  aunt anne this demon best man of mrs cliffords tale who has  such a way with him that he elopes with a bride on the very day of her wedding and keeps up the game by dispatching forged telegrams which purport to come from her too impassive husband is a barely conceivable character and even if we go so far as to admit that his proceedings are possible we feel with that astute young lady miss hilda wangel that  it wouldnt end there of course it wouldnt and when the runaway couple finally separate at leghorn the confiding reader becomes aware that he has been cheated by the author with a whimsical unconventionality of the natural outcome of these loverlike journeyings by land and sea in short helen halstead would either have waited for her rightful lord and master flopping overcoat and all at dover till doomsday or she would have gone with the fascinating frank merroday  a few steps furtherto the devil the  demon  lover is by no means so dear to the masculine as he obviously is to the feminine mind in this particular instance he acts to put it bluntly like a cad and for all bis effervescence and enthusiasm like a coldblooded specimen of the genus it is born in upon the impartial observer of life that women not infrequently fall in love with this sort of creature to the discomfiture of worthier if less exciting admirers but men are apt strangely enough to begin by despising him and to end after a sufficient acquaintance with his peculiarities by kicking him out of their houses mr rudyard kipling is to some extent responsibleas witness the story of the gadsbys and other examples that might be citedfor the rise of this new variety of hero who uses a woman as a doormat and walks ont in search of fresh amatory experiences over the prostrate forms of his earlier victims but mrs clifford has certainly succeeded in improving upon the type this is the way in which frank merreday talks on his return from the  sentimental journey  to his confidante mrs percy ives   you knowyou know how it is i neednt tell you a slip of a girl of twenty this time last time it was a woman of fiveandthirty  i trampled her into the dust brute that i am and left her there now this girl is returning the compliment i dont believe that i ever really cared a jot for any other woman in the world unless it was you i shall always love you dearbut that is different and this is the way his  dear idiot jean galton throws herself down under his boots a little desperation spread itself over her calm face as she answered i couldnt live without you if you cant give me more than you do now i must be content and thankful to have that i believe you would do anything on earth for me he said with wondering conviction yes anything on earth she repeated in her clear voice full of unflinching affection  i would work like a slave for you day and night i would be a beggar in the street if it would do you any good i would let you kill me if you liked i dont know anything that i would not do for you no matter how badly you treated me in return he looked down into her eyes while she spoke he saw her deficiency in charm her homeliness he noticed curiously the eager birdlike expression on her face he felt compassion for her and grateful to her but above all he felt the hopelessness of its ever being possible that he could give her more than he gave her now it is in passages like this that what is wanting in mrs cliffords book becomes apparent it is clever fresh cynical epigrammatic stimulating picturesque  all these qualities are abundantly present in  a wild proxy as they have been in everything that wo have seen from its authors pen since the publication of her  anyhow stories we will tell her frankly and in a spirit of perfect friendliness what it is the volume lacks it is that secretion of a wise brain and a warm heart that lends a charm to the work of the great novelists of our race from fielding to thackeray and is known for want of a better name as  the milk of human kindness we are sure she possesses it but it should not be absent even from jeu ov esprit like this,unmarked

the silver fox by martin ross and e g somerville 6s lawrence and bullen they dont even write hunting stories in ireland after the ordinary fashion these should according to every orthodox standard be of an honest crudity of colour and clamorous with strident laughter calculated to reach the senses after a hard days riding in the keen air now this is a hunting story horses and hounds seem very real things in the writers bands and yet it is a delicate piece of work quite unfitted to keep a sleepy squire awake it offers him subtleties and fine tones and he will only snort indignantly if told the subtleties and delicacies are real things observed and divined with wonderful accuracy the audacity does not stop there the supernatural is introduced not in the shape of an honest creditable old family ghost with a clanking chain in the blueroom either but of an uncanny slinking fox that heralds misfortune because its lair in the hillside has been disturbed when gravel was wanted for a new railway we are not quite sure of the success of that fox the matter for all the calamities was there independent of him but it is as impressive as and a good deal less disagreeable than the yellow dog in i the carissima all the rest is excellent lady susan is a fine photograph she is the kind of woman to be treated by the photographer slaney the dreamer with brains and a tender heart is exquisitely suggested indeed the remarkable thing about this book is its power of delicate and forcible suggestion  the silver fox    by martin ross and e e somerville lawrence  bullen this is another good novel well written and eminently readable it has atmosphere and these authors too belong to a land ireland they treat the old thorneslove friendship and death but they have a light hand and a merry flyaway style most suitable to a story whose main interest is hunting being irish theyoannot get quite away from  the celtic glamour or the  irish wonderworld or whatever it is called and so we have the silver fox an evil beast omen of disaster darting through the pages we like the girl slaney her eyes were clear and half shy like a boys and she had a fastidious spiritual mouth which the wrong man kissed once to find it a trembling and human one she also had a delicate clever hand we are glad bunbury won it in the end the authors sail gaily between shoals and over rocks when tragedy is inevitable they treat it with reticence and in the end the attractive scoundrel is catched in his own snare a bright breezy buoyant book we could have wished it longer  the silver fox by marton ross

the secret of the wild in this u unusual account of wild life in england to quote the subtitle mr calvert has written a book of great originality and charm he has the combined gifts of naturalist novelist and essayist the dedication to his father suggests that the work is in large measure auto biographical though doubtless an element o f fiction has been introduced t h e volume gives us a vivid and detailed account of wild life in a mountainous p a r t of england which w e a r e probably right in identifying as a corner of lakeland but the authors extraordinarily sensitive observations of animal and bird life are described pholo by mr w a calvert e 0 hvpppi against a human background there is indeed a wordsworthian atmosphere in these pages and we might almost call the volume a prose  excursion mr calvert brings us into intimate contact with wild nature as seen through the eyes of a child growing stage by stage to maturity the book opens with a portrait of old isaac pharaoh the molecatcher who having in his youth been disappointed in love has lived for many years a solitary  isaac pharaoh had become a man apart and the younger generation that knew not at all or perhaps only imperfectly the tragedy of his youthful daydreams passed him by as a man of unpleasant disposition and one to be avoided he worked alone and many were the rumours of his hoarded wealth but none dare question him nor had any human being crossed the threshold of his cottage a pretty little thatched building standing in a clump of trees at the foot of the hill just below the outlet of the lake he had prepared the place for his bride but since she had refused to enter none other had been permitted to do so his garden was large enough to provide him with every vegetable he needed and the keepers stated that the game of the home plantations and the fish from both lake and river supplied him the year round with all his meat one night however as isaac is about his business of molecatching he finds an abandoned baby upon the hillside he takes the child home with him and brings him up with a mothers care as soon as crispin is old enough he becomes isaacs companion in all his wanderings and activities and growing into a strong boy he is able at length to roam farther afield by himself his environment offers him abundant variety of scope for observation and adventure  crispins home stood on a promontory at the parting of the waterswhere the lake ceased and became a swiftflowing river a wall bounded the north side of the garden and from it one could see right up to the pass at the head of the dale the surrounding fells were bare and rugged and a solitary island which lay some few hundred yards above the cottage was thoroughly in keeping with them this island was not very big in fact it was little more than a heap of mammoth boulders but at one end there rose a conicalshaped pinnacle with a scraggy holly bush growing at the summit and tufts of heather and parsleyfern adorning the sides no living creature dwelled there   the secret of the wild by w r calvert 12s 6d hutchinson in sensitive poetic prose which never lapses into sentimentality mr calvert follows crispins development as a boy and youth living close to the heart of nature in her wildest moods the 1 fe of mountain and stream of marsh and seashore is described with a wealth of intimate detail that will fascinate all nature lovers the author has many new storiesobviously the fruit of his own patient and loving observationabout the more familiar kinds of animal fish and bird but he introduces us also to lesser known species one of his most arresting chapters dealing with the very rare visit to this part of england of some ospreys mr calvert is no gilder of the natural he is keenly alive to the red tooth and claw in nearly all his pictures and stories of wild life there is a tragic element yet his pages are full of the beauty and poetry that are inseparably bound up with tragedy and throughout his book the human interest is naturally and powerfully sustained with the pathetic passing of old isaac and the idyllic courtship of crispin he brings to an end a volume in which fact and sentiment are blended with rare taste and fragrance gilbert thomas,unmarked

our lady of the pillar by eca de queiroz done into english by edgar prestage constable  co the chief merit of the  defunto  in the original is its deliberately alembicated style but it has the additional interest of exhibiting a realistic writer experimenting in the domain of pure romance the story which mr prestage has translated under the title of our lady of the pillar contains as much incident as one of those comedias de enredo like  dineros son calidad where a supernatural element provides a fresh complication don ruy de cardenas and donna leonor are cast in the same mould as most of the enterprising lovers and innocent ladies in calderons dramas and are neither new nor convincing but there is a genuine note of horror in the episode of the corpse resuscitated on gallows hill and the scene in which don alonso de lara grasps the situation is written with great power apart from some extravagant details the experiment is successful the tale proves the versatility of queirozs talent and hil faculty of impressive conception his premature death seven years ago was an irreparable loss to portuguese literature the translation though faithful is wanting in distinction and the preliminary note to the reader is too digressive a short critical essay on queiroz would be more useful and relevant than a description of his monument in the largo do quintella   our lady of tke pillar by ea ds qumroz done into english by edah prestage constable 2s 6d net the sweet miracle by eca de queiroz done into english by eoeaa pajsaiaeb masher the works of though portuguese novelist eca de queiroz of whom we have two little translations by mr edgar prestage before usshould be translated entire by tte same hand and published for though delectation of english leaders queiroz was ibo founder ol the modern realist school in portugal and being born in 1843 he accomplished in the lifetime that closed in 1900 a gleat work  cousin basil  the correspondence of fradique mendes  the relic  and other books show the extraordinary versatility of the man the breadth ol hts sympathies the exactness of his observation his humour the richness of his mind his unique vividness of presentation in the original bis management of language recalls that of flaubert and we may soy at once that mr pie si age has done very well in his translations we have here not a little of the music i the original the inevitable aptness and vividness of the words the rigid rejection of the unfitting and the harmony of style that breathes through the whole af each of these short stories  ow lady of the ptuar  ie a weak that one i canswt forget in ttme sentiment subject it is medieval it sella of a young spanish knight and his love for a young spanish lady married to a jealous old noble of the horrible trap by which the lover who had no idea ol pressing his suit was lured into visiting the old nobles country castle and of the strange means by which the virgin ai the pillar saved him from being foully murdered it is a weird an enthralling story of gibbets by tenaty roadsides of creaking chains ct a efead felon who came to life and returned when his mission was done tonis gibbet passionate love and hideous jealousy and lofty honour are in every line there is deep mystery and thaifig horror and over all the blase of the spanish sun 00 the glowing depths of the spanish sight but what makes the story especially remarkable is the manner of ito telling the extraordinary closeness and vividness of imagination the sharpness ot effect the severe economy of words with which the desired impression is irresistibly conveyed it shows workmanship of the highest order so in its very different way does the sweet miracle suave milagre this is a little fantasy of the holy land in the days of our lord a rich man of samaria sends bis servants toseek him that he may remove the misfortunes that have befallen his estates they cannot find him a roman centurion sends his soldiers to seek him that he may cure his only daughter they cannot find him a crippled boy who has lain starving and groaning on the rags of a rotting mattress in a hovel wishes that he might come to cure him and with a smile he appears in the doorway once more the particular effect is gained by severe economy of means it is perfecta minute jewel but flawless and of the first water and cut by a master hand,unmarked

  the moral of the ghastly account of convict discipline published by messrs bentley is a little out of date perhaps as a reaction from the horrors which undoubtedly at one time prevailed in our penal settlements the tendency of late years has been some people think towards the extreme of unwise indulgence to habitual criminals but those who have an antiquarian bias in favour of the terrible may feed full on hideous anecdotes of torture murder and cannibalism such readers as are not at once deterred by the nature of the subject will find considerable descriptive power displayed a complicated plot and certainly no lack of incident the characters of course are for the most part horribly depraved as befits the atmosphere of norfolk island and macquarie harbour  but even among such a godless crew there are degrees and varieties of idiosyncrasy and the author might have dealt more effectively with finer materials but thc interest of the tale is concentrated in the hopeless tragedy of the miserable rufus dawes who from his unjust conviction to his violent death is the victim of an appalling series of hostile circumstances his first misfortune is his shameful birth when j nat of rge he is connected by untoward chance with the murder of his father though how the prosecuting counsel got over the fact that the property of which the murdered man was robbed was never traced to the prisoners possession our author does not explain on his outward voyage in the convict ship he discovers a projected mutiny and on the testimony of the guilty parties is condemned as the original author of their plot he escapes from confinement at macquarie or rather is left behind when the settlement is abandoned this freak of fortune also turns to his discredit when reduced to the verge of famine he falls in with a small party in nearly as wretched a position the commandants wife and daughter with an officer named frere already an old hand at tyranny undtr the guise of discipline have been marooned on the desolate coast by convict mutineers daws joins them saves them by his skill and resource from famine and finally enables them to escape he is rewarded by frere who takes the credit of the transaction with further condemnation as an absconder to perpetual slavery at port arthur the death of mrs vickers from the hardships she has endured and the brain fever of the child who might have testified in his favour prevent poor daws from any possibility of disproving the assertions of his enemy finally he has the exquisite pain of seeing the child he learned to love with the concentration of a heart closed to all other objects married to the villain who has been the bane of his whole life how out of this wretchedness one glimpse of happiness survives and at the very last moment lights his dark passage to restful death is told with skill and pathos we shall not attempt to explain the process by which the real heroism of this poor mangled felon is brought into relief at the climax of his history nor to enter into detail as to the fortunes of minor characters on a very crowded stage and will conclude by saying that though we would never willingly read the book again we recognise some tragic force in the method  of its writing i,unmarked

object of the book may be said to survive to the last if we assume it to bo represented by the character of ravensdale himself under the series of influences brought about by the revolving years the mode of arriving at it we must think clumsy and inartificial still there are noble things elicited in this character which is that a proud selfbrooding not naturally bad disposition but made evil by circumstances by want of proper restraints by those jealousies and exactions of a too susceptible temper which tum the host qualities to a bad account and by the cold disregard of all external aids and higher consolations there is a singular and expressive truth in though portraiture on the one hand of the poor girl who becomes his wife buffering under this difficulty of temper and on the other

though it may not obtain more than qualified praise from miss austen the writer seems to have drawn her chief inspiration and this is a model quite as dangerous ns it is admirable we know of nothing

has stumbled somewhat she has really not aj little of the raiuuto fidelity of detail the easy manner and the nice perception of character which make miss austen s itooks so delightful but mero writing mere wordphrasing views drawn from books and though want of that compactness and singleness of purposo which the charm of reality gives to a 6tory however slight in texturo or apparently unconnected interfere to spoil those better qualifies still it is long since we read a book of this class with upon the whole greater promise in it the scenes are too many the connexion too slight and the canvas too much spread for the subject that fills it but it is impossible not to recognise and enjoy the shrewdness the familiarity with kioks as well as life and the social whim and satire displayed in the course of the tale the opening sketch of the luttrells is so good that we attribute something of the sense of failure in the later scenes to an expectation thus somewhat too highly raised but mr francis luttrell is good to the last so is the mother of the heroine and in the touches which mark poor mies esther s transition to old nwiidisra as well as in the jilting flirting match making and

writer of genius you feel this when you have advanced a few pages and the feeling never leaves you even through the comparative failure of the last volume what his exact drift may have been in writing such a book wo do not quite see  for we more than doubt if its tendency can be held favourable to the jewish community though it conveys to thc christian some grave and important lessons but the people brought into a book by a man of genius are apt to do and say for themselves more than appears to bo formally set down for them  and this we may accept as in some degree explaining what many will think the unsatisfactory impression produced by jacob bendixen it is not simply the christians who are intolerant the narrative would seem to teach us  but the jews also  and from that clash of intolerance on both sides we must draw for ourselves what silent lessons of tolerance we may they will not be few or unimpressive when the book is rightly read it opens with a picture of the hems boyhood and of the influences stamped indelibly on those tender years when to the brand of caste is added that of persecution here there are several very touching passages made doubly effective by the contrast which immediately follows of the ame youth oast suddenly amid the livelier enjoyments and larger life of a family of christians the result is that his faith in all that may be called extrinsic to the jewish dogma is shaken  and we could have no better evidence of the writers ability than though effect which this produces on though jewish household wo so how injustice begets injustice and to what evil issues persecution tends in continuing though very bigotries from which it draws excuse and support observing this unfavourable side in though persecuted race we are next shown th less favourable side in the christian and a love engagement into which thc hero has entered closes in mortification and despair we do not think the subsequent scenes in france and algeria very successful in so far as the story is concerned but the writing continues to to admirable  and with the return of the jew to copenhagen his fall into the worldly habits of his tribe the blighted lifo and mean pursuit showing still the old liberal and noble nature and finally his funeral with the accompanying yells of the mob and though stones thing against his coffin wo close a book which is calculated to leave a strong and salutary impression j on all but the most superficial readers of the conrail and thc harem wo may simply say that though story hardly justifies the title it is a romantic tale of the civil wars of italy in though middle ages narrated originally in choice italian and to which madame pisani has given a graceful knglish dress neither convent nor harem figure in it however except that from the latter ono of its heroines emerges and in the former its other heroine earnestly longs for repose though scene is stormily filled with guelph and ghibeline and though principal incidents aro those of that terrible contest between ugolino and kuggieri of which dante has made such appalling use in his immortal poem very different is the scene and strangely contrasted

rzctzow life in dakecarlia the parsonage of mora by fredrika    bremer translated by william howiftt 1845 chap man and hall there can be no more pleasing task to the critic than to review a new work by miss bremer and yet the labour light and agreeable as it seems is not unattended with difficulty the charming dialogues and picturesque scenes which our authoress touches off so happily are too apt to cause him to forget the sterner portion of his duty and to overlook the great defect of these popular fictionsthe lax tone of morality pervading the majority of the series we may probably be deemed fastidious but it appears to us that too low a standard is allowed to feminine purity and thus a dark shade is cast over that otherwise beautiful story home and we fear that life in dalecarlia cannot be exempted from a similar reproach in the former novel a lady represented as moving in the higher circles of swedish life an excellent and exemplary woman but just escapes an entanglement with the tutor of her children a young man of 20 in the present tale a lady of equally admirable character loved and respected by an attached md worthy husband lives with him for years without ac luainting him with her former marriagea marriage unhap pily contracted against the advice of friends with a clever but unprincipled man whose contempt for human ordinances separates him from his wife and subjects him to the ignominy of a shameful death this man is believed dead so far the wife is justified in marrying again yet how she can live on year after year with an openhearted confiding husband keeping her own secret and yet happy seems such an anomaly that really we can neither reconcile ourselves to the fact nor the lady perhaps we might not have made this protest but for the purpose of noticing the difference existing betweenb english and swedish manners and of observing that although our own domestic life may be less romantic than that of our northern friends it is in appearance at least infinitely more moral yet how ungrateful it seems to make these remarks when we consider how much we are indebted to the howtrrs for the introduction of their booksbooks that have pictured in such bright colours the delights of homethat holy word so dear to every englishmanand that have thrown a halo around the most trivial and commonplace offices of life investing them with a charm which many must have felt but more forgotten ever existed or if remembered remembered but to ridicule and now having finished our homily let us at once start for dalecarlia where a mrs ingelborgh the wife of the

german fairy not the pretty delicate elf of merrie england or the waggish imp of old ireland whether sailing on the silja  the eye of dalarna galloping wildly on the beforementioned furious brunehilda or diving for the wed ding ring of martins stina is difficult to decide perhaps her thoughtful gentle though sportive spirit may not be better displayed than in a walk with her lover and selfelected tutor olof nordevall on the banks of the silja olof gazed on the rivers playful windings on the distant mountain veiled in an azure mystic shadow and he thought on siri for that landscape with its changing physiognomy was to him as an image of the charming enigmatical maiden who continued more and more to occupy his mind his heart was now softened towards her for he called to mind her late acqui escence and her tears as he then went on and thought he began to bear delicious notes of a rute they played one of those northern melodies in which a sad seriousness is pervaded by i know not what touching innocent joy and every close has a moriendo in which the tone does not seem to terminate but to disappear like a spirit in space which goes to continue its song upon another shore deeply was olofs soul now smitten by these notes and by this holy still lifethe life of dalarnawhich he seemed to drink in from them the young man became warmed and eltvated in spirit and it seemed to him as if some deep and beautiful secret of existence was about in this moment to be revealed to him lie knew well that the siren who called forth these tones was no other than siri and be followed them in order to discover her he soon descried her where she lay in the soft grass by a verdant sepulchral mount near the riverbank wild rosebushes which in certain districts so richly adorn the margin of the dalilf budded around her and the elk durathor shook as he lay at her feet his little bells as he already at a distance heard sume one approaching sid too looked up she blushed a little at olofs presence and greeted him in a friendly manner she looked gentle but not joyous that was beautiful which you just now played  said olof did you think so  said she  then i will play more for you she played again some melodious measures and then said  do you know what these are  that is the song that the water spirit by ifusby sings at night as he sits on the rock at the waterfall above the mill the words are  and i hope and i hope that my rleleemer liveth ah i how gladly would i hear him when be sings this and he actually sits there at night and sings said olof smiling while he seated himself on a little hillock opposite to siri yes so they say answered siri hesitatingly i know well that others say that it is all superstition but then much must be superstition which is right beautiful and which sounds like truth for example tell me something more about these things said olof familiarly  for example about the cairnpeople continued siri  do you know what dwells in the cairn here  they are the cairn people for the sepulchral mount is a spirithouse and when we on a summer evening lay ourselves down beside such a mount we hear the music within they are the cairnpeople who play on their harps and sing laments over their captivity and call on men for salvation if you promise it them then they play blithely the whole night through but if you answer them you have no redeemer i  then do they dash their harps to pieces amid lamentations and remain silent in the cairn and do you know that in the springs live maidens who are very beautiful but who are captives and beneath their silver roof long for the day of judgment for then shall they be free they are dumb and look very sorrowful and roll slowly their eyes and shed large tears yes in all streams and lakes in mountain and wood are these beings found who are captive and who seek after release ah olof how do i pity all these and gladly would i liberate them i have often felt and feel it again at the present

various and picturesque names of these rooms and halls gathered out of all periods of history out of the kingdoms of both fancy and reality contribute to give to the place a romantic interest for the

copper ore beamed from the walls roof and door w where is the monarch who has such a palace as that in which we now are  but notwithstanding all this siri did not find here the palaces the magnificent underworld of which she had dreamed to herself and whose names the jewel the crown the sceptre c seemed to promise there were perpetually the same dark vaulted passages the same great empty balls and domes exca vations and shafts or sinkings out of which eternal night seemed to stare upon you there was everywhere the same damp cold air the same dripping and dropping from above and which rendered the floor slippery the sides of the mine glittered indeed when the torches shone upon them or when they were struck against them and sent forth showers of sparks and the stalactites glimmered also as they hung above on the arched roofs but it was a chill and colourless gleam wlich left soul and sense cold in the passages the miners frequently were met with torches in their hands in their black dresses with solemn pale grimy countenances and slow and heavy steps the life in the mine did not seem to be joyous and at every glance sirns eyes grew darker and her heart more oppressed she would

the celestial omnibus and other stories by e m fosmstz london sidgwick and jackson limited 3s 6d the halfdozen stories in this book are full of the finest writi ig humour tenderness and a touch of malice sometimesmalice smiling through tears the clearsightedness of the humane ironist they all deal with the country to which the celestial omnibus may be supposed to run the land of truth and poetry where fauns and dryads still play in the beechwood that purer dimate rse vapour transparentu e drado is as unknown to the precious pedant as to the vulgar sentimentalist mr forster knows that other kingdom copse is lust at the end of the garden and that dryads may be kissed by mortals wherever there are trees to shade men from the sun a the first story describes the panic fear that seizes a picnic party on an italian hill in the noonday heat and incidentally the making of a poet out of a schoolboy  the other side of the hedge is not so good being something of a bare allegory  the celestial omnibus gives particulars of the serice that runs at sunrise and sunset from surbiton to elysium and shows how mr septimus bons president of the literary society was found wanting in simple faith  other kingdom perhaps the finest of the six is a meredithian scene and harcourt worters a sir willoughby patterne of less olympian dimensions and more realistic speech the curates friend shows us that simple pagan faith may be found even in a parson and in the road from colonus  is represented the soul of a merchant which makes a last flutter at the age of sixty but is resolutely suffocated by his domestic relations some of mr forsters best work is in this book together with the secret of his other books he sees the humours and shows us in true tones the characters he observes because he sees them against a fairy background of beauty,unmarked
short stories dunky fitlow by a e coppard cape 7s 6d among contemporary writers of the short story there are few whose work has been so consistently exciting and disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it there for it renews ones hopes in mr copards future mrrk i il e vam  short sto ries by c henry warren midsummer night madness by sean ofaolain 7s 6d jonathan cape sally go round the moon by h e bates 3s 6d white owl press mr sean ofaolain is a newcomer to the ranks of the short story writers of today this is his first book and it places him right away among the best of that handful of young writers who realising that the short story is the twentieth centurys most individual contribution to literature have schooled their genius to this highly disciplinary form the modern short storyas witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with fiery sharpness in fifty pages the author can give a degree of reality to the lives of his characters which many novelists never achieve in four hundred but the best story in the book is  the small lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed to stand alone   sally go round the moon  is a long short story by a young writer whose work has for some time been attracting the discriminating few mr batess special forte is stories in a delicately lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the exercise of just that lyric power which is his special contribution to the art of the modern short story,unmarked
i fen vcc the last of nelson s aijantemnons captain oliamikks bkn 11uack hy captain iiamikk rn author of 44 the life of a sailor c l vols bentley london bkitisu seamen have always fought with enthusiasm and enthusiasm they have always inspired whenever they have been either written or talked about by any thing with a heart better than a split block or a condemned dead eye much of this high feeling is indigenous and inherent in the british animal itruns in his blood he is pugnacious for the mere pleasure of fighting and generally victorious from the mere est with which he sets about thrashing his enemies now all this is very well but were it not for other considerations would be prone to degenerate into brutality and ferocity and the warrior would be converted into the savage it cannot be expected nor is it perhaps desirable that the refinements of education should polish the subordinate class of seamen to which we allude nor have they as yet very extensively had that effect but other and very powerful causes have been in operation which have elevated the mere instinct of courage to the noble sentiment of heroism and taught the british sailor that respect for himself his hardships and his privations that have brought all the noble virtues in their train among which the beaming forehead of mercy has ever shone conspicuously this elevation of character this feeling of superiority that exists in spite of his ignorance and in the midst of his isolation from the rest of his species so characteristic of the british seaman we hope we may still say of the present day arises almost wholly from two causes the first the example and the influence of his officers the second the inspiriting and elevating stimulus of nautical literature with the first cause on reviewing this work we have nothing further to do than to say that this stimulus has in a degree extended aft from the forecastle and the same song that has cheered the captain of the forecastle has not wholly been ineffective upon thc feelings of the captain himself mere nautical literature was at a very low ebb until the time of smollett  that vivacious witty and very graphic author was the first who turned the public attention to the physical singularities and moral idiosyncrasies of the sturdy british tar but he only described he sought neither to elevate or improve he pourtiaed with the fidelity ufa moreland and filth consequently too often made up the greatest part of the picture had it not been for his sterling humour the nautical parts of his writings would have been intolerable after this for the lapse of nearly fifty years jack was permitted to play the fool fight and conquer without attracting any notice to his mere personal and distinctive character he certainly had improved a little and but a very little and that improvement arose merely from the reflex of his superior officers even the stirring times and the menacing events of the parker mutiny drew little attention to the mass beyond securing to them a somewhat more liberal allowance and a grcuter protection from the caprices of tyranny classes of men like nations must have their peculiar literature before they can be justly described either as flourishing or much better than semibarbarous as yet no generous writer had started fearlessly from the ranks of literary routine either to direct or do justice to the energies of the british sailor who consequently was generally regarded by his brethren of the sod as little better than a courageous brute at sea and a blustering fool on shore dibdin wrote and at once a halo of light danced upon the sailors brow the songs spoke to his heart humanised and ennobled it he now knew the value of his own bravery and consequently honoured the bravery of his enemy he affixed immediately a higher notion to the word duty  and his duty henceforward became his pride ami his pleasure these songs gave him principle and taught him patriotism they braced his heart in danger and softened it in repose riley did more they converted passion into sentiment and planted in his bosom selfveneration from that time jack was somebody and not only somebody but somebody of consequence also but still something also was wanting the more properly to elucidate his character and make the world acquainted with his sterling qualitiesin the detail and thus individually improve upon the opinion that the public began tohaveof him generally from the songs of dibdin as yet to the world at large he was nothing but an abstract idea though a noble one dibdin not being a siilor himself could not supply thc deficiency all was vagueness and uncertainty till captain flashed forth upon the orlop deck the light of literature and the mutiny at the nore became a classical event thc nnuticolyrical poet had prepared the waythe novelist stepped forward and the navy was provided with a literature that is peculiarly its ow n and so excellent that it may successfully compete with t lat of 44canip or court or grove we of all persons cannot bc expected to enumerate the able novel writers that have done honour to themselves and improved the condition and advanced the estimation of ail those connected with their servicethe list is ample and brilliant for each class of officers has found its chronicler and thc work now before us has undertaken to describe the nobleinindedness and the high moral superiority of the manofwars foremast man the character of 44 ben brace is genuine he is the glorious type of a glorious class certainly not the th tit idea but actually the imin not of a thorough british seaman 44 the last of the agamemnons how sonorous how homeric is the title and how true ben brace tells his own tale in proprid personaand how beautifully he tells it his idiom is critically classicalnot a flaw to be found in his maindeck dialect it is wey with thc flavour of thc grog tub and redolent of tar and oakum his metaphors they fly out as freely as thc pennant in the breeze his reasonings are as close as yardarm and vardarm and as consecutive as the marines and afterguard tailing on the main braces and his conclusions invariably chockablock the land lubbers dont perhaps understand this how should they oor fellows theyve never had any education a man must go to sea to learn something well cliamier has hooked ben brace on to lord nelsonfrom the first trip of the latter to the death that ratified his immortality on board the victory at the battle of trafalgar we have therefore a complete biography of our greatest naval hero in the very complete and graphic phraseology of this best of all bens but the reader will never understand its excellence until we give him a specimen of it where shall we choose  it is a matter of indifference for should we be so unadvised as to point out this or that particular part as thc best we have only to turn over another leaf and find a still better but before we extract we must premise that though nelson s life is the main stream of the story there are several excellent episodes bens own affairs being the best he has just returned to his old father and mother in their cottage in cawsand bay he has the rhino in his pouch and the attorneys clerk is rather importunate for the old gentlemans rentthe clerk looks warlike now ben go on 44 4 what says i 4 have you cleared for action and come into though enemys port to hattie the watch with him im for you my heroand 1 seized him hy though throat the little quilldriver fixed his hands upon my shirtsleeves  his face wras

hell have you for striking him hell take the law of you 44 4 i tell you what it is says i  ill sot up my damaged shirt here against his nose and i think ive the host of it 44 4 never mind darno said the old fisherman  to find bon at such a moment is worth all the money in the world now the attorney may go to i could dance a hornpipe and kick up bobs adying 44 night came on and a precious night it was mother was for giving me their bed and father talked of pricking for the softest plank hut i said 4 no im the youngest and the host to caulk the seam  so i took up my station in the old chair though i have stood by nelsons side when the proudest victory ever gained was won yet 1 never felt as i did at that moment i thought somehow i could fly i felt so light so happy well the old pair blessed me1 that had left them and had occasioned such distress to them and who had i remained might perhaps have saved jane also then father snapped his fingers and says he 4 a dogfishs eye for that snubnosed attorneys clerk  well manage somehow and they went to bed  i slept like a top and was making up the leeway of my nap when i heard a row at the door and i saw the little shark the clerks master with his precious assistant who was marked with a pair of beautiful black eyes and his nose as bits as a cocoanut 44  halloa shipmate said i 4 you lintot have run stun on to thc chimneysweep and taken some of bis soot to paint your figurehead 44 4 here is the account of rent due for this house said be to my luther  do you intend to pay it  44 4 how much is it obi snuff and twopenny said 1

more besides 44 4 ill have you up before the magistrate said the clerk 4 for the assault upon nie last night 44 4 you he cld  said i 44 upon which the attorney whispered to bis clerk who ran away home whilst the old one blockaded the port he soon returned with the receipt 44 4 theres your money my boy said i  4 and i dont want any receipt foi the attack you made upon me last night and tore my shirt i see you show that as ptain aa thc nos un your face so brush old sweepings ami tapestrings nothing personal you knowbut curse me if ever 1 saw such an illbegotten bandylegged beggar with eyes like two burnt boles in a blanket and mouth like a sick codfish so away be went here is something of the manner and something of the matter ot ben brace however as we have begun upon braces own life instead of his masters nelson for he was his steward on shore as well as being his coxswain on board we will veer and haul upon it a little longer brace has a sister a sweet girl who has been seduced by one tackle a clever brave overbearing blackguard smuggler in his second visit to his parents he meets without knowing her this sister and travels with her and her sickly delicate infant in the same waggon she has been deserted and her intention is now to leave her child with her parents without making herself known and then to commit suicide ben relieves her of course as yet they know not each other jane has placed the child in a basket ben stumbles over it at the threshold of her fathers cottageit is taken inand a letter discovers the name of the poor child ben rushes out to find the mother having with great difficulty prevailed upon his parents to receive and bless her he sees something that at first he supposes to be a ghost 44 i gave a start hack and 1 felt a cold shiver run through me as if i hail touched a dead one then came again the same low dismal moaning and 1 got as much a coward as the two captains in benbows action  why says i to myself 4 ben brace ure you afraid and nelsons coxswainnot a bit of it so i tried again i went steadily along the house saying my prayers when 1 distinguished a woman seated like under the lee of the stone in order to shelter herself from the inclemency of the weather 44 4 holloa messmate said i 4 you have got a bad birth of it here why you will lie blown to pieces before morning 44  leave me said the woman4 leave nie to die  i have lost my c bibi for iver  it bas been taken from nie  and i have waited here watchin the door which encloses my infant but is closed against me 4 i recollected the voice in a moment  it was that of the poor forlorn eieatme who bad come down with me in the waggon and whom i now knew to be my own sist r my heart swelled and my voice was almost stifled  1 was just able however to stammer ont 4 jane laue come to a brothers arms  4 is it you ben now 1 die happy  youll bo a father to itwont you ben and she jumped upon her foot and threw her arms round my nook 4 nownow promise me not to let it starve and 1 will go null die elsewhereoh my heart my heart 1 feel it breaking whenever 1 think i am to quit this place and leave it there hut ill stay until daylight  i have been at the window twice but i did not hear it cry  hut the wind shook the small shutter and may be it drowned its noise 44 i kissed jane and she gave me back a hundred she hung round my neck and she cried like a baby  it was some time before 1 took her by the hand and told her that father and mellier had forgiven her and that the door would he opened to her and that she must come with me 44 4 never bennever could i look she said 4 upon father and mother again they will curse me and i shall go mad no as yet 1 do not know if they have cursed meand that is some happiness oh  my child  my child  44  your mother has taken the child said 1 4 and 1 have been to though ferry to search for you 4  then it was you that kicked the basket oh how my heart tailed nie when 1 saw my child kicked in the dirt and did not dare to rosene it 44 4 jonie along jane said i  and 1 dragged her to the threshold 4 come jane and be a daughter to the old ones  and 1 rapped at the door 1 felt her tremble and she sank down at my feet my father opened the door he could not bring a light for the wind was boisterous   here she is father said i 44 4 where said he 44 4 here at my feet  the old man rushed toward his child  he seized her by the arm 4 jane jane  do 1 live to see you again  to bless you my lost one to comfort you  here s your child asleep and heres your mother  come cheer up  44 my mother looked at her daughter as she lay on the floor for we had lifted her in i got the big armchair  but 1 sawr jane shudder at though sight of it and she hung her head down to the ground i went to my mother and i touched her arm 4 mother said i your promise 44 but she looked at her daughter in a strange uuinrgiviug maimer by degrees 1 coaxed her nearer and nearer and no sooner did 1 place janes hand in hers and she felt the touch than she burst out acryingand blessed her child 1 never saw such a scene there was jane dripping wet lying along the floor she never spoke or cried  she was dried up by grief and there was her father the rough old fisherman whose life had been one struggle against the storms of heaven now beaten fairly beaton by a womans silent sorrow my mother had raised janes hoad and placed it on her knees whilst i stood behind my father endeavouring to shame my tears  well we got all hands to bed and the next morning 1 arose with the conscience of a man who has done a good act 1 was as light as a eork and skipped about like one of the figures we so in punchs box before we piped to breakfast i was on my road to susans which was about a hundred yards from our house she was up and received me very kindly  she saw i was in high spirits and asked me the reason  janes come back susan said i why what do you look so contemptuous about she is forgiven and youll come 1 know and see her and he her friend as you used to be   no no mr brace she answered   that i can never do think what the world would say if i was the friend of a bad woman  i should bo thought no bettor than she was no it must not be and i cannot consent to h ive a sistcrmlaw whose conduct has been so reprehensible 44 4 thats a long word susan said 1  and perhaps its a good one but it sounds like as much as to say you never will shake hands with my sister again  that you wont be ber friend now that she most requires it 44 4 certainly mr brace said she 4 that is what i mean 44 4 then vou never shall sav that von are mrs brace  and the sooner you are mrs tapes the sooner you may repent ot this ungenerous conduct 1 tell you what it is miss susan you see i came the captain over her 4 your beait is not in the right place or you would feel for one of your own sex ami rather endeavour to raise than to trample on her so goodbyc to you  we part company from this moment  and hereafter when that attorney bas cheated you out of your person and your property you will think oi the sailor the coxswain of nelson 44 theni took off my bat and making ber a proper bow lifting up let le to keep the balance even as i bobbed my bead and right hand   tfloodbve to von miss susan i i bone vou mav feel the satisfaction which i feel at this moment  for although i leave the girl 1 have loved ever since i was the height of a tireshovel yet 1 know that 1 have done what is right i just took a last look and i saw her lift ber apron to her eyes then run into her house 44 4 there said 1 as 1 nearly run foul o the attorney 4 thin es a clear coast tor you to smuggle upon old tapes but use her well for she is a nice craft alter all and we part friends so tip us your flipper and good luck to von both   we have staid so long on the nile that wc have no time to dwell ow the more glorious and fatal victory of trafalgar which is told it possible in a still more powerful manner but brace has not all the burden of narration upon himself he has a queer devilmaycare sort of fellow occasionally his shipmate and messmate who now and then spins out a very funny yarn of his own this facetious companion rejoices and makes every one else rejoice in thc euphonious title of tom toprail toms marriage at portsmouth is perhaps thc most humorous certainly thc most ludicrous part of thc novel the general reader may perhaps think it overcharged wc can assure him that it is by no means so seamen of ardent temperaments after a long confinement on boan a manofwar when they first put their feet ow shore really become jovially insane and arc actuated by none of thc impulses common to their less exalted fellow creatures lt is not pride that impels them to these ludicrous displays ot riding outside coaches with streamers flying and tiddlers scraping they know at the time that it is abominably foolish but wc arc inclined io think that they are moved to these absurdities more bv a spirit of mad daring than by any other impulse whatever may be the cause the tacts arc ridiculous enough and arc intolerably more disgusting in their actual perpetration in chainiers description they arc not only farcical but grotesquely humorous without ever departing from thc actual fact as these displays gradually becoming more untrcqucnt w ih through the improvement of thc seamans morah soon altogether cease and bc matter only of history it is consolatory to have the remembrance of them perpetuated by an historian so able as is captain clumner w o irii txmur hun  n ot though hattie ot though nile u lnrli n e u es otorai totom r  nno tor nmt ot room but to return to brace at the battle of trafalgar he gets lopped of an arm and at the same time that he loses his master his admiral and bb friend he loses also an eye but here we must notice a discrepancy that we cannot exactly explain if 1 baner nodded surely the 44 last of the agamemnon may be allowed to take a nap in the second volume ben tells us very shortly that being a cripple in june 1800 he went down to iosport ami married susan she then being with some children the widow of the lawyer tapes well being a married man he then tries back and after much yarning spins us out most excellently the battle of trafalgar which battle crippled him well in the third volume coming up with the body of nelson and performing a prominent part at the funeral ceremonies according to his late lordships request he repairs immediately to merton communicates with lady hamilton and then goes down not to iosport but to rochester to see his wife and had the satisfaction of finding a warm heart and a warm cottage ready to receive him we hope that this is all right for the sake of bens veracity for we should almost break our hearts if we found him tripping but we really cannot find as he never left the hotly of his old friend until it was interred how he could have possibly got married to susan after he became crippled for in another page he says explicitly thus 41 my duty drove mc to him who had ever been my friend and when my heart beat right again 1 resolved to obey his last command and go to merton lv yet 1 had not seen my wife for she was living near toetester on fifty pounds a year c thc mistake that ben makes about the seals on tackles secret papers is still more egregious but as the acute lawyers and counsel did not find it out in the memorable trial of brace reruns hawk wc shall also let it slip by in silence had we not mentioned these trivial errors so beautifully do wc think that captain barnier has done his work and so candidly do we express our opinion of its excellence that our notice would have appeared fulsome in its encomiums enough of this the fifty pounds a year permitted to bens wife as long as the seals of tackles secret remained unbroken are found to be insufficient to support the wife and family decently so brace becomes and glories in the metamorphosis a ireenwich pensioner all this part of his life is rich and genuinely natural we like the old sailor better as a pensioner than in any other capacity the tale now begins to wind up rapidly his few old shipmates die offold tom the last his sisters daughter by tackle of w hom he has a long while lost sight and who was a protegee of lord nelson and lady hamilton has in the interim married a post captain a lord and a young lord of the admiralty to boot the meeting between the uncle and niece is too good to be omitted  well i got thinking of ono thing and another when i was startled by the noise of a carriage which drew up alongside the gatos whilst two chaps in cocked hats and long canes who had been standing abaft jumped down opened the cabin door and out comes the captain and his wife ltp i got directly and steered towards the gate for 1 thought had never seen so tine a concern with such a crew the gentleman was a man about tiveaudfnrty togged off to thc nines and ho gives his ann to his ladv and makes sail right towards mc steering lor tin govt i mn  house w ell i did as we always did saluted a straugei when lu caine into port  so as they went by 1 took oil my hat and sciaped my lg the inly was looking tin other way at a gingerbread haigc

the garden of resurrection by e temple thurston 6s chapman  hall the refreshing feature of mr temple thurstons work is its individuality what he writes is emphatically his own and could not possibly be mistaken for any one elses work an anonymous  temple thurston  would be detected at once and though his popularity is a strong incentive to imitation no counterfeit has yet been produced which would deceive the experienced novel reader for a single chapter in a word mr temple thurston has a style he has created a new genre and for all that it appears so easy to copy he has somehow contrived to keep his formula secret as to the merits of the thurstonesque manner there may be two opinions but there can be no question of its popularity mr thurston has invented a new form of entertainment and his circulation proves that the public appreciates it his books are so easy to read that they produce an illusion of being easy to write but in reality the art of being sentimental without being sickly is not so simple as it looks and mr thurston adds to his gift of sentiment a keen eye for beauty in everyday scenes and an untiring capacity for enjoying life everything that is beautiful appeals to him and he can find beauty in much that to most people appears trivial or coramonplace the subtitle of mr thurstons new book  the love story of an ugly man is characteristic of his method for really there is no reason why the hero should have been more than ordiiarily plain except to excite the readers sentimental pity indeed mr thurston makes an unnecessary demand on the readers credulity whenhe suggests that the wealthy mr bellairs was so ugly that his ugliness made him repellent to women especially when the course of the story makes it clear that all the nice women in the book were not repelled by it at all if we were disposed to be critical we might complain that mfr thurston begins by claiming our sympathy for his hero under false pretences but mr thurston never gives the reader time to be critical lie sweeps on with such buoyant good spirits and frank enjoyment of natural beauty that we are hypnotised into aclpting his prenisses without demur  the garden of resurrection  has not the charm of  the city of beautiful nonsense and it contains one needlessly painful incident but it is very good thurston for all that  the garden o remurrection by e temple thurston chapman  hall in his latest novel mr temple thurston has evidently set forth with a steadfast resolve to be whimsical and fantastic at all hazards probability is thrown to the winds and the result as meredith tight have said is not  a revel of rough truth but a veritable banquet of extravagance the hero who is disfigured by smallpox so greatly that women turn from him with aversion outquixotes quixote in his pursuit and championship of a girl of remotely negroid ancestry whose name and circumstances are revealed to him by a conversation overheard by chance in a restaurant when betrayed and destitute she eventually seeks him out in spite of her previous prejudice against him he tends and finally espouses her it is a rather preposterous story told with some charm and agility together with a certain firmness of touch that reminds us of the authors earlier and less sentimental work his secession from the real to the aggressively pretty does not please us although it may make for an increase in general popularity  the garden of resurrection by e temple thurston i chapman and hall 6s it seems to us that bellwattlea curious nickname for a very nice ladywas quite right when she told mr bellairs that he was morbid about his ugliness although he may have been badly pockmarked and perhaps not originally endowed with a greek perfection of feature it was hardly necessary for him to wander so disconsolately through life believing himself a monster of unattractiveness he was really a charming gentleman in a mournful and at times slightly ridiculous way mr thurston has succeeded with great neatness in doing that rather difficult thing which is to make his hero tell his own story and remain the only person in or out of it who is ignorant of his attractions in mr bellairs quixotic venture of going to ireland to warn a helpless young girl whom a cad had brought over from dominica to marry and imprisoned in the house of his two shedragons of aunts we have nothing to lament exc3ept that he did not carry it out with more dash he failed to make her believe his warning and received as thanks a promise that the fair dominican would pray never to look upon him again this upset mr bellairs very much as he was already in love with her we think mr thurston insists a little too much on his hopelessness of inspiring a reciprocal passion mr bellairs who had longed so earnestly for romance scarcely realised it when it came but he acted entirely in character and that is the main thing in a sentimental romance just as much as in a bloodandiron work of realism we were genuinely pleased when he received his final reward mr thurston possesses that derided but not inestimable gift of painting a man who is a gentleman in all he does he is also a writer of a rare studiousness incapable of bad grammar and scorning an ugly cadence he is hardly robust enough to move us very deeply but he has in a marked degree the gift of being entirely readable we hesitate to say that he has charm because that word has been so cheapened by being bestowed where it is not deserved but if mr thurston does not object to sharing the quality with a good many rather questionable folk we cannot withhold it from him,unmarked

1 the doctors wife ts new novels by the author of lady audleys secretc 3 vols maxwell  co in the october of 1862 we noticed lady audley  secret and in october 1864 we are about to review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his mistress the interview between the lovers is intended to be most pathetic the widow whose husband lies unburied assuring mr lansdell that he has no need to ask her forgiveness and mr lansdell commending the lady to the protection of his family mr lansdell dies penitent leaving the bulk of his vast property to isabel and his murderer escapes to america thus freed from her plebeian husband

ia tjle wrowq paradise and other stories by andrew lang kegan paul trench  co we live in an era of marvellous expansion as in the elizabethan age england woke up to a consciousness of america and the east so now in what i suppose for want of a better name we must call the victorian age she has woke up to a consciousness of the pacific and the indian ocean of africa and australia of the solar system and the cosmos generally this discovery reacts upon literature the romance of anthropology and the romance of the universe are the keynote of art in the present generation stevenson rider haggard lang all exhibit it from day to day it becomes more pronounced in magazine articles and in the general bookmarket mr langs new volume shows the anthropological bias in every page happy are they who have the last results of a difficult science set in so delightful a guise before them the pill is so lelicately and cunningly sugared that only the wise will over detect its underlying silliness the fooli4i wvill swallow it whole at a gulp as a mere dainty sweetmeat for mr lang can never help being amusing if he were to write a plane trigonometry for the use of schools sines and cosines would wink at us solemnly with a merry twinkle and isosceles triangles would skip before our eyes like the little hills of the hebrew psalmist his first story  the end of phaeacia introduces us to a missionary of the bungletonian connexion the boanerges of the pacific who lights in the course of his evangelistic wanderings on the last surviving specimen of a greek community and describes the manners and customs of these benighted heathens as an officer of the salvation army might naturally be expected to describe them in this case i cannot help thinking mr lang has allowed his archaeological knowledge to run away with himn i have never been accned of an excessive regard for missionary effort  but if the customs of phaeacia were at all as he paints them i confess that the rev thomas gowles hlis my sincerest sympathy the tharelia seem to have been a very unpleasant ceremony indeed and any man even if not a boanergvs might reasonably object to being first floged and then slowly roasted to death over a lingering fire my love for the greeks has never been strong since i escaped alive fromu aeschylus and plato and mr lang has suecceeded in finally convincing me that the modern locofoco movement goes after all far ahead of the ancient athenian ticket a biological critic might also object to the presence on scheria or boothland of stags bears wolves antelopes and other large terrestrial mammals which have no right at all to exist on an oceanic island as mr wallace has abundantly proved to us if boothland hall an indigenous mammalian fauna at all and even new zealand has none i would earnestly contend that it must have been of a low marsupial and australian type this however is to inquire too curiously fiction is fiction and must be allowed some little latitude else will people begin to assert that the name of pickwick is not to be found in the london directory and that they have searched the clergy list in vain for the bishop of barchester or the rev james crawley  in the wrong paradise  is a charming paper detailing the trials of an agnostic and a member of the united presbyterian kirk who get into the happy huntingground of the ojibbeways a modem poetaster who finds himself in the greek elysium and an arabic professor much incommoded by the too pressing attentions of gazelleeyed houris belonging to the school of beauty chiefly admired by the faithful of islam its theological implications impress an anxious mind as verging on heterodoxy  the romance of the first radical strikes at the very roots of society and religion for it sets forth the appalling and revolutionary doctrine that  a thing is not necessarily wrong because the medicine men say so and the tribe believes them if such ideas are scattered abroad no security will remain for the deepest and most sacred convictions of our nature whywhy too is more in advance of his age than any single radical can ever be even mr lang himself lets us see in this very volume that he objects to home rule believes in the sacred right of somebody to taboo a whole shire and regards nonpayment of rent to a landlord as a culpable breach of the eighth commandment  the great gladstone myth is a variation on an old and wellworn theme but so cleverly handled that one reads it all with an unbroken sense of perfect novelty i am glad mr lang seems to admit that there may be something in the  spencerian or euhemeristic method but perhaps this is merely an oversight altogether two things are to be said from two points of view about these stories if we regard them merely as warx desprit they sparkle with wit and abound in the finest undertones of irony if we regard them as light contributions to anthropology and mythology they are rich in pregnant hints of real value and cut some knotty points a great deal better than professorial seriousness grtantr allen,unmarked

vividly the stirring scenes and incidents in which he has taken part that when he disposes himself  to tell a tale his readers take up his book like children anxious to hear the captain carries them through mazy paths and tangled wildernesses dragging his character through dangers that make his readers hold their breath for a time he is too goodnatured however to break their hearts by any fatal occurrence or if tragedy there must be it is the right people who come to grief those whom the reader rejoices to see punished but after going through more dangers than they have hairs on their head and doing more hard riding fighting and forced marching than would have served all the paladins of king arthur put together they escape at last the heroines in full beauty without a scratch or a freckle upon their complexions even their costumes not materially disarranged or worse for wear whilst the heroes always find fortunes in their forays so that they are able to buy a fine estate to settle down upon when the curtain falls the true and graphic descriptions of tropical scenery and natural objects keep the critical faculty of the reader quiet and make him to accept amicably if not with faith the wild impossibilities of the narrative in this present novel however we are ungrateful enough to recollect that we have heard a great deal of it before the captain himself has told it to us those who have read the war trail will recognise the description of the  butte huerfano and the attack ofthe handful of white men hythe arpahoe tribe of indians who besiege them upon it their chief the terrible  red hand is not unknown to us also speaking as children we should say that the captain makes up his tale as he goes along with so many exclamations and insignificant incidents that the story is delayed to our great impatience the captain indulges in terribly fine words and fine writing who ever speaking the language of men talked thus the encarmined blossom of the bignonia to me a symbol of the sweetest sentiment i had carefully preserved in a glass i had placed it on the dressingtable of my chamber with its peduncle immersed in water lovers male and female have in all ages we suppose put cherished flowers in water but they would scarcely recognise the familiar instinct under such wonderful terms lovers may and do talk a great deal of nonsense no doubt but a young man might record his preference of a blonde beauty in less stilted language there was another contrast that had at this time an influence on my hearts inclinings to an eye fatigued with dwelling long and continuously on the dark complexions of the south the olivine hue of azec and iberian skins there was a relief in the radiance of this carmined blonde c but we would have forgiven all that if the progress of though story had not been slackened to allow whole ages of this sort of writing to find a place we also complain that the author who although many miles distant could know and tell us all that passed in the secret interview between the mormon apostle and huhman holt the father of the two heroines also what passed in the glade of the forest and the despair of the young hunter in his solitude never  tells us a word about how marian went away with the mormon nor how she discovered his villainy nor how she escaped from him nor how she fell under the protection of walker the good indian we are indeed told something about his finding her tied to a tree but so confusedly and vaguely that ordinary readers will never make it out the  secret by which stebbins the mormon held the father of lillian and marian in his power is never properly disclosed the whole story is diffuse in unnecessary places and most unsatisfactorily huddled up and hurried over when it comes to pointe of vital interest captain main reid is more successful in his shorter and less ambitious stories when he keeps to the facts and does not go off into nonsense about feelings and sentiment,unmarked

  new novels the rose of life by m e braddon hutchinson  co the mighty influence of the zeitgeist is plainly discernible in this latest work of the veteran novelist thirty years ago it would have seemed unlikely that miss braddon would ever write a novel depending for interest less on plot than characterization yet such is the enterprise which she has here not unsuccessfully achieved the popular poet with his attractive egotism his ready though chiefly vicarious philanthropy and his genuine superiority to snobbishness and all its works is well conceived and so harmoniously developed that when he is detected in the act of swindling one of his best friends the disclosure though dramatically unexpected does not strike us as inconsistent with what we already know of him his simpleminded devoted wife is also good in her way and has the merit rare in that particular type of woman of conciliating sympathy rather than rousing irritation the villains male and female the heroine and the titular hero are none of them of much account and the device of the bigamous marriage scarcely appeals to us as it did in the days when it was a comparatively new thing in fiction,unmarked
siege perilous and other stories by maud diver tohn murray 75 6d net mits dxivr has collected here her occasional short stories most of them are staged in the east and three recount incidents taken direct from life in india they are it is scarcely necessary to say eminently readable full of human and romantic interest and unaffectedly told that they are not in any sense distinguished or unique is only another proof that life and art actuality and significance are not interchangeable terms mrs divers characters have in fact the somewhat ephemeral value of agreeable acquaintances they are types rather than individuals and they tend to link together the incidents of a plot rather than to reveal themselves through its action this lack of depth and subtlety of characterisation is particularly noticeable in the longest story from which her book takes its title the situation is cleverly conceived but her handling of it is so superficial that we are left with the impression of a hand moving pieces arbitrarily on a chessboard of a problem easily solved because it has never been truthfully tackled mrs diver succeeds best where realistic action is most independent of realistic psychology and the east therefore with its primitive and picturesque customs its violence and its simplicity always favours her talent additional interest attaches to this book through d chapter devoted to some afghan and indian reminiscences of lord roberts and a set of verses in his memory,unmarked
the way of all flesh the way op all flesh by samuel butler 11th impression of 2nd edition fifield 6s 6d net the appearance of a new impression of  the way of all flesh  in mr fifields edition of samuel butlers works gives us an occasion to consider more calmly the merits and the failings of that entertainnig story like all unique works of authors who stand even to the most obvious apprehension aside from the general path it has been overwhelmed with superlatives the case is familiar enough and the explanation is simple and brutal it is hardly worth while to give it the truth is that although there is no inherent reason why the isolated novel of an author who devotes himself to other forms should not be  one of the great novels of the world the probabilities tell heavily against it on the other hand an isolated novel makes a good stick to beat the age it is fairly certain to have something sufficiently unique about it to be useful for the purpose even its blemishes have a knack of being sui generis to elevate it is therefor bound to imply the diminution of its contemporaries yet apart from the general argument there are particular reasons why the praise of  the way of all flesh  should be circumspect samuel butler knew extraordinarily well what he was about his novel was written intermittently between 1872 and 1884 when he abandoned it in the twenty remaining years of his life he did nothing to it and we have mr streatfeilds word for it that  he professed himself dissatisfied with it as a whole and always intended to rewrite or at any rate to revise it we could have deduced as much from his refusal to publish the book the certainty of commercial failure never deterred butler from publication  he was in the happy situation of being able to publish at his own expense a book of whose merit he was himself satisfied his only reason for abandoning  the way of all flesh  was his own dissatisfaction with it his instruction that it should be published in its present form alter his death proves nothing against his own estimate butler knew at least as well as we that the good things in his book were legion he did not wish the world or his own reputation to lose the benefit of them but there are differences between a novel which contains innumerable good things and a great novel the most important is that a great novel does not contain innumerable good things you may not pick out the plums because the pudding falls to pieces if you do in  the way of all flesh however a compere is always present whose business it is to say good things his perpetual flow of asides is pleasant because the asides are piquant and in their way to the point butlers mind being a good mind had a predilection for the object and his detestation of the rotunder platitudes of a greek chorus if nothing else had taught him that a cornerman should have something to say on the subject in hand his arguments are designed to assist his narrative  moreover they are sympathetic to thc modern mind an enlightened hedonism is about all that is left to us and butlers hatred of humbug is though a little more placid like our own we share his ethical likes and dislikes as an audience we are ready to laugh at his asides and on the first night at least to laugh at them even when they interrupt the play but our liking for the theses cannot alter the fact that  the way of all flesh  is a roman d thises not that there is anything wrong with the roman d theses if the theses emerge from the narrative without its having to be obviously doctored nor does it matter very much that a compere should be present all the while provided that he does not take upon himself to replace the demonstration the narrative must afford by arguments outside it but what happens in  the way of all flesh   we may leave aside the minor thesis of heredity for it emerges gently enough from the story besides we are not quite sure what it is we have no doubt on the other hand about the major thesis it is blazoned on the title page with its submalicious quotation from st paul to the romans  we know that all things work together for good to them that love god the necessary gloss on this text is given in chapter lxviii where ernest after his arrest is thus described  he had nothing more to lose money friends character all were gone for a very long time if not for ever but there was something else also that had taken its flight along with these i mean the fear of that which man could do unto him cantabit vacuus who could hurt him more than he had been hurt already  let him but be able to earn his bread and he knew of nothing which he dared not venture if it would make the world a happier place for those who were young and loveable herein he found so much comfort that he almost wished he had lost his reputation even more completelyfor he saw that it was like a mans life which may be found of them that lose it and lost of them that would find it he should not have had the courage to give up all for christss sake but now christ had mercifully taken all and lo t it seemed as though all were found as the days went slowly by he came to see that christianity and the denial of christianity after all met as much as any other extremes do it was a fight about namesnot about things practically the church of rome the church of england and the freethinker have the same ideal standard and meet in the gentleman  for he is the most perfect saint who is the most perfect gentleman with this help the text and the thesis can be translated  all experience does a gentleman good it is the kind of thing we should like very much to believe as an article of faith it was held with passion and vehemence by dostoevsky though the connotation of the word  gentleman  was for him very different from the connotation it had for butler butlers gentleman it should be said in passing was very much the ideal of a period and not at all quod semper quod ubique  a very victorian antivictorianism dostoevsky worked his thesis out with a ruthless devotion to realistic probability he emptied the cornucopia of misery upon his heroes and drove them to suicide one after another and then had the audacity to challenge the world to say that they were not better more human and more lovable for the disaster in which they were inevitably overwhelmed and though it is hard to say  yes  to his challenge it is harder still to say  no in the case of ernest pontifex however we do not care to respond to the challenge at all the experiment is faked and proves nothing it is mere humbug to declare that a man has been thrown into the waters of life to sink or swim when there is an anxious but coolheaded friend on the bank with a 70000 litebelt to throw after him the moment his head goes under that is neither danger nor experience even if ernest pontifex knew nothing of the future awaiting him as we are assured he did not it makes no difference we know he cannot sink  he is a lay figure with a pneumatic body whether he became a lay figure for butler also we cannot say  we can merely register the fact that the book breaks down after ernests misadventure with miss maitland a deplorably unsubstantial episode to be the crisis of a piece of writing so firm in texture and solid in values as the preceding chapters ernest as a man has an intense nonexistence after all as far as tjie positive side of  the way of all flesh  is concerned butlers eggs are all in one basket if the adult ernest does not materialize the book hangs in empty air whatever it may be instead it is not a great novel nor even a good one so much established we may begin to collect the good things christina is the best of them she is on any standard a remarkable creation butler was  all round  christina both by analysis and synthesis she is wholly his he can produce her in either way she lives as flesh and blood and has not a little of our affection  she is also constructed by definition if it were not too awful a thing to say of anybody she meant well the whole phrase gives exactly christinas stature alethea pontifex is really a bluff  but the blurt succeeds largely because having experience of christina we dare not call it mrs jupp is triumphantly complete there are even moments when she seems greater than mrs quickly the novels that contain three such women or two if we reckon the uncertain alethea who is really only a vehicle for butlers very best sayings as cancelled by the nonexistent ellen can be counted we suppose on our ten fingers of the men theobald is well worked out in both senses of the word but we know little of what went on inside him we can fill out christina with her inimitable daydreams  theobald remains something of a skeleton whereas we have no difficulty at all with dr skinner of roughborough we have a sense of him in retirement steadily filling the shelves with volumes of skinner and we know how it was done when he reappears we assume the continuity of his existence without demur the glimpse of george pontifex is also satisfying  after the christening party we know him for a solid reality pryer was halfcreated when his name was chosen butler did the rest in a single paragraph which contains a perfect delineation of  the oxford manner  twenty years before it had become a disease known to ordinary diagnosis the curious may find this towards the beginning of chapter li but ernest upon whom so much depends is a phantoma dream child waiting the incarnation which butler refused him foi twenty years was it laziness was it a felt incapacity  we do not know but in the case of a novelist it is our duty to believe the worst the particularity of our attitude to butler appears in the fact that we are disappointed not with him but with ernest we are even angry with that young man if it had not been for him we believe  the way of all flesh  might have appeared in 1882 it might have shortcircuited  robert elsmere j m m poetry ano time warton lecture on english poetry ix by sir henry newbolt for the british academy humphrey milford ls net the haunting thought of time and transience and the desire for immortality are the stuff of which much of the worlds poetry is made  how the days draw in   is the lament of the anacreons  but they will draw out again the platonists and the christians hopefully reply  draw out indeed to an interminable length there are some who love the earth so well that the only fault they have to find witl lite is its shortness to others this existence is a horrible exile from a fatherland that lies somewhere remote and radiant beyond the bounds of time sir henry newbolt regards the poet as being almost by definition an exile homesick for eternity after showing what has been the attitude of different poets towards the whole problem of time he ventures to suggest to the future poet a new way of envisaging this first and gravest of questions the poets of the future must follow sir henry newbolt and professor mctaggart in regarding time as an illusion  they will be optimistic and encouraging about the destinies ol the world because the future is to be  a progressive manifestation of the eternal now this is one way of disposing of time but there are others the poets of the future may quite as justifiably regard time not as an illusion but as the most fundamental of realities life moves and has its being in time  transience and death are the conditions of existence lt may be that the poets of the future will cease to bewail their exile from a problematic eternity and will rejoice in the incessant movement of a force which is for ever creating and destroying and building again but the poets of the future may safely be left to solve the problem for themselves meanwhile we have to thank sir henry newbolt for a most suggestive lecture on a theme which might with profit be developed at greater length  the way of all flesh by samuel butler a posthumous wrork by the author of  erewhon a note tells us that it was begun in 1872 and that the author was engaged upon it intermittently until 1884  it is therefore to a great extent contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be taken as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book though story deals with an english family which had risen from obscurity and extends over about twothirds of the nineteenth century lt is deliberate philosophical and thoroughly characteristic of its author richards 6s  the way of all flesh bv samuel butler 6s grant richards nobody who is acquainted with mfr samuel butlers former works would look to him for a novel written on popular lines and the wav of all flesh  is as little like the conventional novel of the moment as it was possible to make it it has no intricate plot almost no plot at all for that would have savoured too much of artifice and mr butler had set himself to reveal in these pages the life history of four generations of the pontifex family and did it with a fearless realism and a keen irony and simplicity of style that for purposes of comparison send one back to fielding and swift for its chief interest the book relies and safely relies on its characters who are drawn with remarkable skill and with a profound knowledge of humanity a few pages suffice for a vivid and complete presentment of old mr pontifex who is seventy odd at the beginning of the nineteenth century a quaint rugged village carpenter something of a painter and musician with a gift for organbuilding drawn in more detail is his son george who goes early to london into the business of an uncle and is byandbye partner in an important publishing firm the unfolding of his personality is a fine piece of work  even more so are the subtle developments of georges second son cutlhbert and later of cuthberts son ernest the women of the book are rendered with equal truth they are neither idealised nor distorted but presented simply unflinchingly in the colour of actual life and with all the frailties of humanity it is a novel that has indubitable elements of greatness it is full of a shrewd somewhat cynical philosophy and mellow worldly wisdom and grows upon the reader with an increasing interest because of its strong but unexaggerated human appeal  new novels the way of all flesh by samuel butler i grant richards this posthumous story may be unattractive to the ordinary novel  roader it opens casually it lacks form it has no sensational climax and no heroine it is not a rounded whole but the record of part of a life written as a brief introductory note by mr streatfeild tells us between 1872 and 1884 it exhibits a young mans trials from boyhood his experience in the church his collapse and subsequent rehabilitation in the world in order to explain his qualities his father and mother his grandfather and even his greatgrandfather are paraded before us the older generations with more leisure than an expert novelist would allow himself the heros father a clergyman and his mother are most trenchant portraits but have a belated air as they belong to the time before darwinism such selfdeceiving aggressive pietism as theirs is now we hope rare thus much said as to things which may deter the reader we advise him to persevere in his perusal for he will be well rewarded the book is a lesson to parents concerning the upbringing of their children which is as much needed as ever mr butler an original thinker goes with unerring frankness into the very heart of his subject he says boldly but sometimes too fiercely what many are thinking you may not take his views of life but you will learn something from examining them his irony is a useful dissolvent while his humour and admirably simple style are more effective than much heavy rhetoric good things abound here is happy observation concerning a style which is virtually unassailable yet to many offensive as well as monotonous i daresay she writes very well but she has fallen under the dominion of the words hope think  i feel  try  i bright and  little and can hardly write a page without introducing all these words and some of them more than once there are hints of autobiography too as in the following passagewith the public generally he is not a favourite he is admitted to have talent but it is considered generally to be of a queer un practical kind and no matter how serious he is he is always accused of being in jest his first book was a success for reasons which i have already explained but none of his others have been more than creditable failures he is one of those unfortunate men each one of whose books is sneered at by literary critics as soon as it comes out but becomes  excellent reading as soon as it has been followed by a later work which may in its turn be condemned the book is in fact a genuine piece of samuel butler and that means work of a rare kind by a unique man  fiction the way op all flesh by samuel butler grant richards this posthumous tale by the author of  erewhon  is not really the latest of his works a prefatory note by mr r a streatfield tells us that it was written between 1872 and 1884 and then laid aside with the intention that some day it should be rewritten it is extremely characteristic of mr samuel butlers individual temperament and outlook upon life whimsical and discursive in method racy in expression and full of satire which is often genial and occasionally to our taste at least a little acrid according to mr streatfield the work was largely contemporaneous with  life and habit and may be regarded as a practical illustration of the theory of heredity embodied in that book we regret that we do not recall what mr butlers precise theory of heredity is what the way of all flesh chiefly illustrates is the antagonism of the generations and its satire is mainly levelled at certain more or less unconscious views of parental responsibility which the author detects lurking beneath the moral pretensions of the british bourgeoisie they may be summed up as  willbreaking  at that time it was universally admitted that to spare the rod was to spoil the child and st paul had placed disobedience to parents in very ugly company if his children did anything which mr pontifex disliked they were clearly disobedient to their father in that case there was obviously only one course for a sensible man to take it consisted in checking the first signs of selfwill while his children were still too young to offer serious resistance if their wills were  well broken in childhood to use an expression then much in vogue they would acquire habits of obedience which they would not venture to break through till they were over twentyone years old then they might please themselves  he should know how to protect himself till then he and his money were more at their mercy than he liked the narrative for mr butler is nothing if not biographical carries us through the history of several generations of pontifexes it is upon the head of the rev theobald pontifex who has the misfortune to be a priest as well as a parent that the vials of the authors scorn are most liberally poured and the story culminates in the career of the rev theobalds son ernest the will of ernest pontifex is broken in youth he grows up with an extreme ignorance of the world which lands him first in prison and subsequently in a most undesirable marriage finally he touches earth like antaeus in the bitterness of experience and rises up to be a man and hate his father a philosophical doctrine as to the formation of character by personal experience seems to be at the bottom of the book but it must be observed that ernest pontifex was much helped in the task of recovering his balance in life by the receipt of an unexpected legacy of 70000,unmarked
the dwale bluth hebditchs legacy and other literary remains of oliver madoxbrown author of  gabriel denver edited by w m rossetti and f hueffer london tinsley brothers 1876 the results of the brief literary life of the author of gabriel denver illustrate one not uncommon phenomenon while they are an exception to another the son of an historical painter this wondrous boy for he was but twenty when he died was an instance of the not unfrequent union of pictorial talent with rare gifts of literary description precocious as a child he had never say his biographers up to the time of his death  so much as left for many weeks together the shelter of his paternal roof only for a couple of years before he entered his teens does he seem to have attended even a dayschool yet his work exhibits a lively negative to the saw that homekeeping youths have ever homely wits  and whether we examine his extraordinary juvenile watercolours or study the romances into which more than into his paintings he threw inherited  qualities of prompt solid realistic invention and dramatic force and directness it is impossible to help marvelling at the breadth of his observation the keenness of his eye for scenery and natural forms and objects and the retentiveness with which he husbanded for use as occasion served the sights he saw and the facts he noted at sixteen or thereabouts after singular successes in watercolour painting he wrote the black swan as it is given in the second of these volumes the original draught of his gabriel denver which was published in 1873 by messrs smith and elder he had thought it out and those who take the trouble to read it will be struck by its strong imaginative power and sustained force of passion when he was yet but fifteen like an aeschylean drama in its limited dramatis personae the black swan has but three actors on its scene which is mostly the burning wreck of a tasmanian emigrant ship a strongwilled halfeducated settler his unloved desperate wife and the girl whom gabriel denver idolises and who clings to him in life and death with a sort of mesmeric fascination there are some bits of this extraordinary tale eg gabriel denvers dream from which he wakes to a gradual discovery of the ship being on fire his jealous wifes doing and that wifes previous overhearing gabriel and lauras lovemaking upon the deck while they remain as utterly unconscious of her presence  as a bird is of a lynx which is hidden in the foliage waiting for a spring   or again in the crisis of the black sivanjs fate the description of the way in which fire and water clear away all the live figures from the burning deck except a trio  physically held together as the author puts it  by the ties of passion the hatred and love which entangled them mentally which must be owned to be of grand conception and the phenomena of the ocean on which they drift in an open boat for three or four days in its rest and its disturbance as well as of hunger and thirst in their gradually developed stages betoken a conscientious study of records of like adventures not always to be found in young authors of rich imagination the writer of such a tale may have resolved to forsake the brush from other motives than  some restive idiosyncrasy  forbidding him  to tread the paternal vestiges perhaps he felt a constraining sense that the canvas fails to tell a whole tale with the breadth and detail and ample verge of the written romance anyhow he dedicated himself to literature the dwale bluth a devon synonym of the deadly nightshade arose out of a five weeks visit to lynmouth and its environs in 1871 and shows inter alia the grasp with which young madoxbrown fastened upon a congenial subject the weird region of the yethhounds the dartmoor legend of the logan stone tanta rabobs huxen or the devils ankleblade and the tradition of a family bold and mad enough to cherish an ancestral dwelling beneath the latter furnished him with a theme sufficiently full of loves and hates and marriages and misadventures to supply ample food for a thrilling tale of wonder and terror into this tale the aspiring author throws two ingredients unmeddled with by him hitherto dialectic peculiarities and a quasicomic element when the last baronet but one of the serpleton race dies the dartmoor folk said  dang ma buttons nif settens nainself daunt warnt ter ba shut on un

of the third hebditchs legacy though we do not think it as clearlydrawn or as attractive this may be due to a more tangled plot and more shadowy characters perhaps too chambers in cliffords inn and

to assure us that had his life not been cut short in its very flower he would have poured forth richer and more perfect fruit of a rare and teeming fancy even the delirium stage of his fatal illness

memorial verses of his friend philip bourke marston pp 2130 james davies  the divale bluth hebditcks legacy and other literary remains of oliver madoxbrovm edited by william m rossetti and f hueffer with a memoir 2 vols tinsley brothers nothing is sadder than to find that the first fruits of early geniusas yet but half matured are the last results we shall ever get yet this will often happen the imagination so soon excited the nerves so highly strung are at once the cause of the promise in the present and of its nonfulfilment in the future the strain has been too great the sword has been too sharp no recent instance illustrates this so strongly as the brief memoir and fragmentary stories that messrs tinsley have published it was in the autumn of 1873 that a strangelooking book of a livid yellow binding with black figures of a burning ship and wreathing smoke and gnawing rats stamped upon the back appeared before the world it was easy for the critics to discern power in its graphic descriptions and in its vigorous language and to this j ustice was done but on the other hand there was a horrible plot and an exaggerated tone which at times became almost grotesque so that the impression finally left was one of repulsion and distaste for few of the readers of the tale were not aware that its author was still a boy and that  gabriel denver was written when oliver madoxbrown was but seventeen years of age had they known this the feeling of wonder and of hope would have been stronger than any other the volumes before us contain the first version of gabriel denver which bore originally the picturesque name of the black swan a name which the publishers with the same stupidity that insisted on altering hawthornes the marble faun into transformation changed into the present commonplace title the same unhappy influence also weakened the story itself by changing the jealous wife into a lover and by giving to the hideous plot an inartistically happy end of the memoir with which the volumes open there is nothing good to say two editors might between them one would think have given a sketch of this gifted boy which would have impressed itself on the memory as it is there are in all but twenty pages and of these about a third are with questionable taste taken up with the prattlings of his childhood and the ravings of his last delirium did he write no letters that might be quoted1 is nothing of his conversation when in health remembered 1 some memorial lines alone by mr philip marston which in their pathetic beauty recall cowleys elegy on mr william harvey seem to convey to us an idea of what oliver madoxbrown really was for the rest we have the barest facts he was born in 1855 when he was eight he began to paint in watercolour in 18g0 when only fourteen he was an exhibitor at the dudley gallery in 1871 he exhibited at the new british institution and in the winter of that year he turned his brush into a pen and wrote the black swan there came some unfinished romances which are here presented to the world and thenthe end in 1874 the poor boy died his brain active to the last still planning new stories or visited by strange visions of the stories before us the fragmentit is only a fragmentcalled  the dwale bluth  a local name for the deadly nightshade is decidedly the finest there is something about it which reminds us of the brontesbut of emily rather than of charlotte this resemblance which seems also to have struck mr marston is chiefly in the character of the incidents and the description of scenery while a certain introspective glance a certain mode of tracing out subtle analogies between the outer life of nature and the inner life of man recalls the still greater name of the famous american romancewriter the very way in which the dwale bluth clings to the hair and poisons the wearer seems to show its relationship to the flowers in rappaccinis garden or among zenobias tresses or by the grave which septimius had dug the story flows clearly along till the end of helens childhood then there i3 apparently a gap and although some other chapters are carefully written and highly finished they do not piece so readily with the first part and after all the tale remains unfinished the faults of the dwale bluth are scarcely noticeable among its rare merits but there is certainly at times an overelaboration in details and the reader might have been spared the unintelligible dialect of devonshire which requires a constant footnote of translation and which therefore adds nothing to the true colouring of the picture on the other hand what power there is in every page what imagination and at times what humour the early history of the serpletons the squire and his gypsy wife the parson with his knowledge of books and his ignorance of all besides the little halfgipsy helenall this is described with a precision and force that call up again unavailing regrets for what this wonderful literary faculty might hereafter have produced no extracts can in the least do justice to the impression which the entire story leaves upon the reader and the following are given only as showing something of the style and spirit in which the work is written   in the autumn examined from the bridlepaths across the distant heights serpleton house but for its pointed gables and the thin wreaths of smoke from its chimneysmight have been taken for one of those huge white fragments of rock with which the northern heights of dartmoor are strewn so wildly projecting from the hillside in a profusion of purple heather and golden furzeblossom in the spring the ancient appletrees along its unenclosed orchards grew radiant in the windy sunlight under the blue sky among the purple cloud  shadows but in the winter with the keen boisterous east wind heavy with mist and sleet driving across the sterile moorlands and whistling harshly through its crevices turning its chimneys and corridors into a monstrous series of organpipes and playirjg sinister tunes on themserpleton house must have looked dreary indeed for a human dwellingplace or take thisthe wild little helen who had once seen the dwale bluth before and was always by some mysterious fascination longing for it goes one day into the deserted garden and rests on the edge of a broken cucumberframe  of a sudden she started and leaned over the broken bars there was what she had been looking after for her downcast eyes fell with an instantaneous revival of interest on the tendrils of the deadly nightshade loaded with poison flowers and berries crawling stealthily round the inside of the frame or crouching ignominiously along the damp ground the traces of snailtracks went all over the bricks and mould and the leaves were bitten here and there but it was singular to note what a number of empty snailshells were lying among its foliage in spite of this it had grown into a goodly plant the dwale bluth is a cowardly creeper and knows no means of rising above the earth it springs from unless by insinuating itself among the leaves of some bolder parasite there it now lay beneath her gaze even throwing a grim and sinister reflection on to her darkcomplexioned face and into her eyes  there it lay at her feet prone and helpless as though it were entreating her to life it how strangely artistic is the touch which marvels at the empty snailshells though the plant was vigorous   hebditchs legacy is still more incomplete than the  dwale bluth and is less easy to follow it would probably have been as weird though not so picturesque a story and there are some of the finest isolated passages in it that can be found among all these fragments the description of the fog in the dying womans room with which  hebditchs legacy opens is hardly inferior to the stormscene in the other tale a curious instance only slightly more marked than many others of the way in which the trained perception of the painter could give reality to the writers scene occurs towards the end of this tale  but facing each other as the uncle and nephew were mr blackoder still had the advantage for he sat with his back to the light and his face was indistinguishable the only features really visible in it were the eyes which witching perhaps the dim reflection of the great silver ipergne glowed under their overhanging brows with a keen motionless gleam of the shorter stories and of the poems there is not much to say they show the writers versatility but they do not show him at his best still for one wild fragment we must find place it is obscure no doubt but it has a something of the ballad ring about it these tracies were descended from one of the murderers of beckett and so woe to the unborn aeons of the tracies  say what redemption is left through all time ob could they reach to the land where gods grace i baffled and faint with the storm winded embrace the wind that wails for their forefatliers crime with ever the wind and rain in their faces never again till the end of time and now as we close these volumesunfinished and immaturewe feel more strongly than ever that a great literary artist was taken from the world by this boys early death of course it is possible that as years passed a genius which was developed so soon might have faded away in the common light of every day but if it had grown with his growth oliver madoxbrown must have taken rank with the great masters of romance as it is we have only these broken remains and this totally inadequate memoir for the first there is now no help but as regards the second it is not too late to hope that the editors will give us such a life as may have both a psychological and a literary value,unmarked

flints for happy hours london pickering what a fertile mind was that of grace aguilar what an early development of reflection of feeling of taste of power of invention of true and earnest eloquence she died upon the verge of womanhood cut off in the very springtiae of her beauty and of her intelligence how great a loss the world sustained is seen now in the succession of posthumous works which her sorrowing friends have published which she with the modesty of genius supposed to be unfit for the public eye because they did not come up to her own ideal standard of excellence but the welcome that has been given to all of them and their undoubted merit shows us what she would have been had it been the will of providence that her genius should ripen to maturity god however thought otherwise and took her pure and holy spirit to himself the daysof bruce is another of her fictions a composition of her early youth but full of beauty her purpose in this story is to depict and develop the character of woman in vamious situations of trial in isabella of buchan we have a picture of a heart wounded in its affections but trustful and hopeful in its misery in isoline the selfinflicted unhappiness of a too confident and selfreliant nature and in agnes  the overwhelming of a mind too much akin to heaven in purity and innocence to battle with the sorrows that beset her path of life guacie aguilan knew the female heart better than any writer of our day and in every fiction from her pen we trace the same masterly analysis and development of the motives and feelings of womans nature the days of bruce possesses also the attractions of an extremely interesting story that absorbs the attention and never suffers it to flaz till the last page is closed and then the reader will lay down the volume with regret mrs nehtox crotand better known perhaps as caiiilla toomxin states in her preface to lydia a womans book that her design was to depict certain phases of life  from a womans point of view and that in doing so she has sought chiefly the approval and sympathy of her own sex the story like all of mrs croslands productions has a wholesome moral not preached however but shown a lesson which the reader learns without the appearance of learning conclusions which he draws for himself with the pleasurable consciousness of selfinstruction this is a groat art in fiction known only to the better class of writers and were we find it we mav be sure that we have passed out of the region of commonplace and are in the company of an author not of a mere scribbler and pretender to authorship mrs cnoslands lydia is an exquisite portrait of a true woman the story is thoroughly rational and probable but never dull she possesses indeed the rare faculty of creating an interest in ordinary things and persons by the charm of her descriptions in short she is an artist  her books are works of art carefully designed conscientiously composed corrected with care having an aim and a plan and therefore not only delighting readers of all classes but commending themselves to the intellectual who desire in a book something more than a mere pastime who rquire it to be like a good picture a menti study and such is lydia miss foudriviers little volume our seto parish is a collection of bketches and short tales which we should have commended very highly had they not been preceded by miss mrinet s our lillage upon the exact model of which they are moulded so little indeed does the author aim at originality that she is content to take the very title with a differenceanother yet the same for it will be obvious at once that our new parish is a very palpable plagiarism from our village the words are changed indeed but the meaning is the same and no less stiiking is the likeness in the sketches that are strung together under this title we regret this for really there is a good deal of merit in the writing the authoress has a lively fancy considerable power of description and invention enough to have produced something original let her make the attempt and we have no doubt it will then be our duty as it will be our pleasure to give her a more cordial welcome than in honesty to our readers we can now proffer,unmarked

i the gamnblers wife a novel by the author of  the young prima donna c inthreevols london 1814 newby    mrs grey excels in painting the pathetic now there is so great a pleasure in the exercise of any power of whose possession we are conscious that nothing claims more continual selfwatchfulness on the part of the novelist than the propensity unduly to indulge his peculiar talent at the expense of that variety which he who assumes to depict the world as it is never should lose sight of mrs grey has fallen into this common error she knows where her strength lies and she constructs all her plots so as to afford the most ample oppor tunities for its exercise  she fills her fictions with scenes of sor row  she is impatient of the smiling pictures which neverthe less are necessary for the introduction of her sombre ones she glides over them with speed and almost with carelessness until she arrives at the pathetic part of her story then she rejoices in her conscious power  her eyes brighten  thoughts throng thick and fast her pen traces them in bold characters she analyses the feelings lays bare every anguished nerve and to use an expressive term piles up the agony  with a skill that rarely fails to move the hardest heart and draw tears from the manliest eye admirably as this is done it is a fault that there is too much of it not only are all her novels of the sombre hue but there is more of painful picturing in each than can be approved by a critical judgment we admit the beauty of a great deal of this painting the exciting interest of the scenes the ability with which they are constructed and the eloquencewithwhich they are described  but there is alimit to the claims of the novelist upon our feelingstouch them but do not harrow them it must be remembered that it is onliv ideal sorrows with which we love to sympathize the sight of real suffering gives us pain nul the skill of the novelist is shown in conducting the reader to the point where the ideal may be excited to the ntmost stretch of emotion without tres l passing upon the realms of the real and producing pain or upon the cloudland of the unnaitural and toppling down the whole fabric fancy had reared airs glay certainly errs in stretching emotion too far and converting a  pleasing pain into a veritable anguish  and the impression whichi her novels leave behind them is that with which we remember somne terrible sorrow it has been our fate to witness in real life the fault for such it is may be readily amended for it grows out of her very excellence and we name it because it would be pity that so much real genius should not seek to be as perfect ai possible the gamblers w fife exhibits this fault together with all the excellences of its predecessors it is a most melancholy tale of treachery disappointment blighted hopes love misplaced misleading passions andl terrible retribution mlaud and mary sunderland are sisters the one proud and self willed the other gentle affectionate

harry percy another cousin a man of the world of middle age practised in deceit who has been ruined by gambling is invited to the mansion he discovers the expectations of mlaud and determines to win her from his rival for her wealths sake great skill is shown in the insidious manner by wbich this is accomplished he however succeeds in his design takes her from balfours arms and marries her the anguish of the betrayed lover is relieved by the sympathy of the gentle mary who soothes his griefs and as is inevitable in such circumstances pity becomes love and sympathy ripens into affection in the meanwhile the treachery of the elder pair is visited by retribution iu every terrible shape the angry father strikes mauds name from his will her mother dies brokenhearted her husband who had

even made an innocent accomplice in a deed of blood to crown her misery she discovers that he has ceased to love her that he is faithless  and the last wretched plank to which she had clung having failed her she sinks in utter despairthe victim of pride selfwill and unbridled passion the scenes through which the reader is carried at the close of her career were those to which we alluded in the remarks with which we opened this notice with those qualifications we can award to the gamblers wife a very high place among the fictions of the season and confidently commend it to the circulating library and its patrons i i i i i i i i  the bankers wife whiativer the juliets of the literary world may say or think there is much  in a namemuch both of ill and of good and if the work we are now called upon to notice had happened to have made its appearance anonymously it would lhave offered a notable proof of both branches of the proposition mrs gores name in the titlepage will of course at once carry it into general circulation among the readers  the bankers wife or court and can ml and daughtes mrs armytage by mril gore authoress of mo of narrative fiction and will thus far prove the good of a name but had it been published anonymously though it might have linkered for a few short weeks on the shelves of the circulating libraries it would after a brief period have started into that sudden fame and popularity with all classes of readers from the most thoughtless to the most thinking which now it will be long in reaching even if it attain them at all the name of its writer first as that of a woman and secondly as that of a popular  novelist will long keep it out of the hands of those  grave and reverend signors who are the chief dispensers of that reputation which they cannot compass for themselves and who till they allow mrs gore to convince them of the fact by such books as the bankers wife will never be satisfied that a woman has been gifted with faculties of observing and setting forth the features of our common nature for the mingled delight and benefit of all for which they may look in vain among their own lordly sex the truth is that the bankers wife should have been written by a man or it should have been left possible by an anonymous titlepage to suppose it so written it would then have passed for the most masterly and instructive exposition that  ever put on paper of that lucrelust which is the most fatal and besetting vice of high civilization and which half neutralises all the virtues of that conditionits aarons rod which however swallows up all the other vices of our time only to disgorge them again in a more loathsome form than they possessed before of this  monster vice of our daythe vilest in its origin yet the most vast and all pervading in its effects mrs gore has here drawn a picture more moving and impressive to the moral sense than the loftiest fiction of old romance or the most soulsubduing dream of modern  sentiment  yet more true to the damning facts that daily beset the hearths and homes of every one of us than the most dry of ancient  chronicles or the most popular of  histories let not the mere novelreader feel alarmed by this opening glance at the new production of his favourite writer its  gaieties are at the least as light as sparkling and as profuse as its  gravities are weighty sterling and stamped with the impresses of moral and social truth if  the bankers wife is perhaps the most valuable and im portant contribution its accomplished author has yet made to that inestimable portion of our contemporary literature which aims at making its readers happier by making them wiser and better it is certainly inferior to none among the brilliant company of its predecessors in those inexhaustible powers of entertainment in which this remarkable writer yields to none of her living rivals and to a very few dead ones  the bankers wife is as we have intimated at the outset of our remarks notably a tale of the present dayof the actual day and hour in which we live and its second title of  court and city bespeaks the wide range taken by its scenes and characters in this respect none of mrs gores novels a ppeal to the tastes and associations of a more numerous body of readers besides the banker hamlyn the hero of the storywho wavers between court and  city and by rights

  jewel a chapter in her life by clart louise burnham bs tonstaowe the charm of stories dealing with childhood is inexhaustible at the same time few subjects require more insight more sincerity more plainness and impersonality of manner in the book before us we have however not only an account of a little american girls influence upon some peculiarly unlovable relations but a very earnest propaganda of christian science lewes has been brought up as a scientist and certainly her quaint and childlike exposition of belief is full of attractive qualities rhe desirability of making a story the vehicle of peculiar views of any sort is always questionable but in the case of jewel the christian science propounded seems to add to rather than to detract from the delicate fascination of her person the subtleties of her religion are simplified down to the most appealing tendernesses of feeling her christian science with its ardentdenial of evil as error unkindness as the error fairy pours a kind of joyous whiteness over the volume the miracles from the literary point of view at any rate are to be regretted but jewel herself for all the colossal bigness of the ideas throbbing in her childish spirit is a real and radiant little creature and that is saying a good deal for the writer for to burden a child of nine vears old with new religious beliefs of some complexity and yet make her persistently vivid and endearing is by no means an easy thing to do  jewel a chapter in her life by clara louise burnham constable  co the recipe for the making of a heroine grows more and more elastic constant readers of fiction must be aware of the widening range in her age and other attributes the rosebud of seventeen summers is not so much to the front the approved ingredients are now age from seven to seventy any class country or appearance you please in this book she is an american lady aged eight and further a convinced christian scientist if this does not savour of novelty the reading palate is jaded indeed jewel as the little girl is called is an unconscious but excellent propagandist of the cause we frankly confess that in spite of her peculiar tenets and upbringing she has won our warm regard the authors attitude towards the young exponent of the newor ought we to call it the old knowledge is charming if she is herselfand it seems probablean adherent she yet turns on the child and occasionally on the faith itself an eye not devoid of humorous influences argument is altogether absent and principles are little in evidence but there is an atmosphere what we get is the effect of the childs belief on new surroundings which include a household of worldly selfabsorbed relatives yet no touch of the folded lamb mars the little girls temperament and character she is a simple child that lightly draws her breath that feels her life in every limb but has besides a quiet strength and a most earnest belief in the real if not quite apparent goodness of those around her a belief that actually produces in some measure certain results her love of all living things and her joy in everything gradually react on a disillusioned and disenchanted set of people her first meeting with a stately reserved grandfather is very pretty and amusing too those who know anything of the phraseology of christian science will at once see  where they are though the author does not force the note even the doll annabelle at first coldly received and neglected by the family becomes in time a persona grata to the reader it is impossible not to perceive the pleasantness of the authors style and enjoy her extremely sympathetic touch on many things,unmarked
the green parrot by bernard capes i smith elder  co is mr capess new story there is a novelist who writes romance which wins the favour of the discreet but has no success among the public we hope that mr capess romance is more fortunate than john wisdoms but some of the facts suggest that mr capes is rather disappointed at his general reception there is however some reason for his lack of popularity and that is found in his persistent avoidance of the simple and cultivation of the bizarre probably the book which had the best chance of popular favour was his first the lake of wine an admirably romantic narrative which utilised the bizarre deftly his highest effort we should feel disposed to see in  a jay of italy but not one of his romances is easy reading not one but is full of intellectual and emotional strangeness assuredly mr capes will keep his admirers among the elect but he is not likely to be acclaimed by the large public as a favourite his latest tale is illustrative of his strength and weakness it is almost wantonly  odd and its eccentricity is emphasised by the authors style one would like to see simpler things in it and more intelligible motives but one recognises its astonishing cleverness hoping at the same time that mr capes will not like john wisdom forswear the pen in disgust  the green parrot fiction by bernard capes smith elder and co 6s this is a book better executed than planned the plot being flimsy and the superstructure elaborate it concerns a literary pair who part at the churchdoor and are brought together by a brainful smike with a green parrot these people especially the husband are uncomfortable creatures and the glorified smike is almost more uncomfortably ideal the more actual persons are a vulgar legal cad who is drawn with an admirable odiousness and a titled tottie an exmusicalhall artiste who falls in love with the hero and cabals with the cad against the heroine whose marriage lines are kept safely in a dressingbag ready tor emergencies the rows the shocking claws and punches the rival ladies indulge in freely are well described but are better done by pallmall shall when she is being arrested the wooing of the cad is as ugly as it would be in hogarth or the flesh  but the real thrill comes when the seraphic smike parrot in hand is chased through a wood into a dark dank pool smelling of silas marner  and drowned or not drowned  that is the agonising question which the reader will grow warm about mr leveson the good critic with a large heart and a game leg is interesting both as a man and as a picture but he must have been most unhappy to find himself in such an ungentle galley and mr capes seems to think that the writing brotherhood and sisterhood are either nasty and popular or artists and misunderstood and so blamelessly splenetic but to this rule he admits wholesome exceptions this is a view somewhat lacking in the manliness of his friend dr johnson and peculiarly untrue in the matter of the craftsmen of good letters they cannot expect to be understood without rubs and buffets and the lapse of time  but to whine bolt and sulk like the delicate mr hearne is not to play the part of an interesting hero,unmarked
  father felixs chronicles by nora i chesson fisher unwin it is probable that mrs chessons temperament prevented her from seeing life whole with the blunt mediaval bar barism people never took things so sadly as father felixs eyes saw them but being a clerk maybe he was born out of due time and became anticipatory of a later century there was far more of the animal in mediaval beings than we allow it is clear that mrs chessons characters outside the narrator realise this they accept their fates without murmur the excellence of the book lies precisely in this realization the author had intuition of the life of the fifteenth century and got up her atmosphere carefully she had in fact assimi lated the period as few novelists of today have done her tale is somewhat dijointed and episodic but its vitality keeps interest for it it is very learned in the times but its learning is never an obsession perhaps the author might have spared her tender readers the pain sorte et dure as applied to a young girl but she does at least spare us the horrible details such details are only proper to the newspaper reports of today the achievement of the book renders deeper the regret that its author has passed for ever from the possibility of greater performance,unmarked
  the divinations of kala persad by headon hill ward lock and bowden mr poignand a young gentleman of limited income no profession and few talents deceived himself into thinking himself possessed of latent powers for the detection of crime he seems almost invariably to have gone on the wrong scent but like many another stupid man he had the knack of finding better endowed persons to do his work for him so he furnished a handsome office interviewed aristocratic clients looked mysteriously wise when professionally in their presence behaved agreeably in luxurious country houses and gained a great reputation for astuteness all by the divinations of a poor hindoo kala persad who was kept in the background the orientals advice was called for in really interesting cases but the stories have one defect a reader of ordinary sharpness invariably detects the criminal if not the manner and motive of the crime as soon even as kala he makes none of poignands mistakes and this has a tendency to make him conceited a writer should beware of puffing up his readers pride the tales of which kala is not the hero are better in this important respect the best of all is  a blind clue an unusual and welcome confession of how a detective failed,unmarked
fiction the winged victory by sarah grand heinemann os net at any rate sarah grand has not sought as have some other novelists to put readers off with inferior matter in this time of all times her novel besides being what all fiction should beentertaining and recreativecontains much thought fitting for consideration today in fact we may credit her not only with having fulfilled the purpose of a novel but also with having produced at the same time a novel with a purpose to say that she had accomplished both things satisfactorily would be to number the book among the classics and that we cannot do for after gladly bestowing so much of appreciation we must unburden ourselves of our main criticism and then proceed to the consideration of her work in some detail her novel will accomplish its purpose we believe in widening the outlook of the average novelreader but to our mind in addition to other faults she has omitted the pith of the matter had she more plainly analysed the nature of the soil from which the roots of the tragedy drew their nourishment it would have been more helpful as she makes one of her characters say  causes are the things to attack not effects she does in fact inform us that the feet of her wingless victory were clay in so far as her motive power was largely the spirit of revenge on those who were responsible for the sufferings of the poor she had the intellect which  kims the surface it is reserved for the spirit whose advances she had slighted to plumb the depths she had taken her fate into her own hands when she preferred intellectual ascendancy to spiritual enlightenment but the whole setting is in a clay soil impervious to light and air the matter of the girls birth is wrapped in secrecy no less foolish than is usual in such cases the secrecy was as much a matter of the conventions as was the luxury with which even the authors best characters surrounded themselves while bemoaning the lot of the poor in not having more of the worlds goods forgetting at the same time how uneconomically they indulged themselves in superabundance the authors 4 big  man closes a sumptuous repast with what would have been blasphemous prayer had he been really big enough to understand the most elementary economy the income which he spent on himself must have been many times more than the average one of 222 for a man and his wife and three children we have no wish to be thought extremists to allow him but the average income would probably have quenched entirely his utility it is the authors blindness to the awful responsibility of her hero that we deplore the authors conception of the world is obviously that of a place where the intolerableness of conditions must be mitigated with the object of its becoming as efficient a school as possible for fitting its pupils for a heaven hereafter and else where in other words the author does not consider that the ideal of heaven on earth is ever likely to come within the range of practical politics the fact that we do not agree with her detracts not a whit from the value o4 the work considered from the authors own point of view and so from that point we will consider it the heroine possesses as did adnam the hero of 4 adnams orchard to which the book is the sequel in a literal sense if not in that usual in fictionan overabundance of excellence which however it is not very hard to credit her with though some of her qualities are difficult of acceptance in the light of her lowly origin in 4 adnams orchard  we had much dissertation on the land here the heroine ella banks who will be remembered as a lacemaker in the former book continues her calling though in very different circumstances the book opens with her being met by the duke of castlefield sayes solicitor who drives her straightway to the west end mansion which has been placed at her disposal society with the capital sthe sign manual of all that is sinfulis induced by the patronage of royalty to frequent her lace exhibition with the inevitable consequence that the protegee receives many unwelcome attentionsthe outcome of one of which involves her in homicide meanwhile she awaits the return of her lover the dukes son her marriage with whom she looks upon as the copingstone of the design by which she will accomplish her object of freeing the lace trade from the sweating conditions imposed on it by the profiteering middlemen meanwhile the duke lavishes wealth and caresses on her and pajrs her clandestine visits late at nightuntil at last the heroine awakens to the fact that scandal is busy with her name at once she believes that there is truth in the rumour which assigns discreditable motives to the dukes attentions in consequence she consents to marry the son without the fathers knowledge and immediately after is made aware that she is the dukes lovechild how the knot is cut we prefer to leave the reader to find out lest this which is to our mind a greater improbability than many which have preceded it should deter any one from the perusal of what after all is a novel far better worth reading than many based upon more likely happenings having very briefly outlined the plot we must allude to some of the admirable characterization there are delineations of the good and bad sides of society which are worthy to be mentioned along with the great names of thackeray and meredith the old lordly reprobate and his parasitic tailors model are two instances and not far behind these are the galaxy of coarseminded women on the other hand we have the princess who betrays her teutonic blood to a degree which will hardly be acceptable today but she is nevertheless a true and lovable presentment the touches with which character are delineated are excellent throughout but we can refer only to a few there ia the solicitorwho was so obviously a man who did not receive orders but was instructedwith his twitching nose reminiscent of a rabbit lady ami an epitome of her caste in all time she felt secure in the established order of good and evil considered that if there were people not equally wellsatisfied with things as they are those people were in the wrong and must be brought to heel and viewing the process from the height of a position whence unpleasant details were not visible to the naked eye she indignantly set aside as impertinent any difference of opinion on the subject that might reach her and was not tobe warned  then the duke her husband he might with justice have called himself a busy man and such business as his has its own importance many lives would have been disarranged and much inconvenience entailed had he neglected it but it was the business of a system of a great machine which ho had not set in motion and could not control it controlled him he was the tool of a machine which was working with results that he knew to be bad in many ways in great measure an ineffectual machine into the defective parts of which he meant to look but never did to any purpose besides his part in the working of the machine was obligatory and obligatory work is not soulsatisfying as an object in life peculiar to himself would have been how he found his real object in life we shall leave readers to discover for themselves some of the traits depicted are easily fitted to people well known a few years ago  but if they have been lifted from life they have been so mixed up as to render them void of any offence occasionally the characters appear to have got out of hand and we like them better freed of the authors control but they appear later to be ruthlessly subjugated to conform with the exigencies of the plot in an age when there is so much more writing and talking than thinking the novel strikes us as overlong towards the end and yet one cannot suggest any of the 650 pages which can safely be skipped,unmarked

barbara ladd 13v charles g d roberts 6s con stable there have been many romances woven out of the conflicting interests and passions that gave colour and intensity to the early days of the american republic but we recall none of greater charm than barbara ladd and none that brings us into closer intimacy with the homely life of the period the story is picturesque and alive with human interest the characters are drawn vividly and with insight and humour the brothers dr jim and dr john with their long silent love of miss mehetable are delightfully quaint robert gault is an ideal hero within human limits but the most masterly study in the book is the headstrong lovable bewitching rebellious barbara herself it was worth writing and would have been worth reading if it gave us nothing else we can warmly recommend it as one of the few new novels that combine the elements of popularity with good workmanship  i barbara ladd by charles g d roberts constable  co our struggle with the insurgent colonies more than a century and a quarter ago has been the motive of some celebrated as well as merely successful stories the one under notice scarcely belongs to either class the heroine aged fourteen is more of a heroine even to her own family and intimate friends than the reader can understand the whole neighbourhood is   agog  over her small joys and sorrows the author begins with an account of a rather superior sunrise sunsets are a little out of favour it used so often to be  the last rays of the setting sun c now is it the influence of tess it is oftener  the miracle of dawn and so forth the heroine makes her dublt as a runaway at break of day an exit by drowning had been previously attempted but we need not add unsuccessfully before the reader has got far in her story or she far in her morning ramble he feels that enough running away has come off or as it were not come off devoted friends recapture the childor is it the woman it is difficult to say one moment she drums her heels on the waistcoat of a male admirer who carries her like a baby the next her hand is kissed and she is addressed as dear lady that her mother was a southerner is considered a sufficient reason that she should believe herself misunderstood by a northern aunt we had yearned for some show of severity from this connecticut lady but in vain she begins to  understand  her niece almost at once and to join the rest of the society in flattering her to the top of her bent two colossal brothers in their way almost as exasperating as the cheeryble brothers of dickens a maternal uncle a youth of high birth whose political faith differs from that of his ladylove and many others bow before her if the manners and speech of these people are in accord with the time and with one another it is surprising i  barbara ladd by g d roberts constable 6s by this time a novel that deals with the american war of independence must have something striking about it to deserve notice at all in america the subject is probably still of such absorbing interest as to command attention for itself but over here we look for something more in a story than the glorification of a patriotism that ceased to have any point for us in 177g  barbara ladd  opens so well that it suggests the existence of that something more quite half the book that half that deals with the childhood of the heroine is full of promise it is interesting and it has a certain amount of literary feeling but when barbara grows up when the scene of the story is transferred to new york the interest drops into the dreariest commonplace we do not find the very heartless coquetry of the extraordinarily beautiful barbara half so fascinating as the author evidently does and we grow horribly tired of her flashing eyes and her red lips and her wonderful hair and the war details are just like the war details of every other book of the kind families are of course divided against families lovers against lovers it is needless to add that barbara and her accepted lover have placed their sympathies in opposite camps the weakest part of the dook comes perhaps at the end where the construction completely breaks down and the feeblest of conclusions is arrived at in consequence the hero drags himself back to the home of his childhood having been severely wounded in a skirmish and the heroine opportunely goes out in her canoe and sees him fall fainting on the opposite bank of the lake the rest is easy to guess but in case there should be any doubt about what follows we quote the heros impassioned speech on his return to consciousness   listen my lady i will draw sword no more in this uarrel i have given my blood my landsi have given as thought my lovefor a cause already lost for a cause that i felt to be wrong from the day of lexington but whichever side wins i will stay in my own country if my country when it is all over will let me stay when i am well enough to go away love love will you go with me to return when the fighting and the fun cease to our own dear river and our own dear woods   everybody of course knows what happens when the wounded hero talks in this fluent way the moment his wounds

feridey manor a novel by mrs mac kenzie daniuls author oe msly sister minnie c in 3 vols london newby mrs daniels ought to take a higher place than she at present occupies in the literary world she really writes very well much better than many we could name who have a wider reputation and assume and are per mnitted a position among the aristocracy of authorship she deserves especially to be presented to the public in a respectable costume neatly and correctly printed with a punctuation that should help the reader instead of perplexing him and an orthography tolerably in accordance with the custom of the english language in short she is entitled to a more tastefiafand accurate printer and we have no doubt that her appearance in so slovenly a garb tends not a little to depress her in the esteem of the literary public who like the rest of the world permits itself to be much governed by appearances but if the reader will surmount the prejudice thus created and read on he will find a great deal that will reward his perseverance ferdey manor is a story of no common interest the plot being woven with a power of invention that will surprise the patrons of english novels althou gh it is rarely absent from the fictions of the french it is in this that our neighbours undoubtedly excel us and we cannot but respect a novelist who may almost rival them in this faculty the only one wanting to a complete triumph for in all other departments of the art of fictionwriting we are their superiors we beat them in power of description in truthfulness of portraiture of persons andl places in humour in pathos in poetry we lack only the faculty of invention and the sparkling vivacity which make the french novels so readable mirs daniels certainly deserves applause for having constructey a novel that exhibits less of our national defect than any we have read for a long time it indicates continued and rapid improvement,unmarked

sir goodings folly a story of the year 1795 by arthur locker 3 vols chap man cc hall about the year 1795 if reliance may be placed on mr locker there lived in york street st jamess a lady whose beauty brought round hera crowd of admirers and whose past history and her mode of life were a source of gossip to fashionable people dwelling in the neighbourhood of the court that she was lovely no one denied that she was much sought after was a fact well known to the chairmen of the court district artd the loungers of whites and boodles that she deserved her popularity was a question which grave and pious persons answered stoutly in the negative lier face and form caused her to be pointed at in the parks as a truthful reproduction of the princess de lamballe in the heyday of her loveliness but the ladys personal charms were not the only attractions which nightly filled her drawingrooms it was not unusual for indigent women of fashion in the last century to keep private gamblingtables at which guests were expected to render homage to chance and beauty at the same time to good people of this generation it may seem scarcely credible that little more than halfacentury since ladies could be proprietors of drawingroom  hells and yet be countenanced by people of good repute such however was the case when george the third was still a vigorous king when adverse fortune compelled a woman of tonne to shift for herself if she had the requisite knowledge of the world and a connexion with people of the right sort she would open a farotable and look for the support of her old associates in her new calling just as a reduced lady nowadays would seek the aid of friends in an attempt to establish a fashionable boardingschool or in endeavours to place herself in any other honest vocation of the many ladies who thus fought the battle of life at the close of the last century none was more admired or talked about than mrs norland of york street a pleasant mystery surrounded the lady it was rumoured that she was the daughter of a village schoolmaster had in girlhood figured amongst the frail beauties of the palais royal had enjoyed the friendship of philippe galite and as the wife of a certain major norland1 had passed some years in india nabobs whispered that major norland had disappeared mysteriously from his post in british india leaving his wife to shift for herself whether the major was still living no one knew  but for all practical purposes mrs norland was a widowfree to please herself alone in accepting and returning the flatteries of many lovers and in no way restrained by considerations of wifely duty mr locker has placed this character on his canvas with great skill the doubts and scandal of her past life aud the temptations surrounding her career as the keeper of a fashionable gamblinghouse neither cause others to speak of her with angry censure nor make her forgetful of selfrespect in spite of baneful educatkm and a demoralising occupation she is a womanly and rightminded creature lovers seek her hand but she keeps them at a distance evening after evening she entertains her patrons and patronesses  displaying a pair of lovely arms and delicatelyshaped hands as she turns up the cards whilst  her face is invisible hidden behind an envious blue domino and it is an affair of conjecture amongst her supporters why she does not yield to one of her many rich suitors and become the wife of a wealthy husband instead of persisting in the exercise of a precarious business amongst her more ardent admirers is sir goodwin anerleya rich baronet who having been a courtier in his youth is at sixty years of age the head of a great commercial house in the city a widower with two charming daughters whose love affairs form an important part of the story prosperous and honoured the stately baronet who is an excellent type of the london gentleman of a hundred years ago falls madly in love with the siren of york street according to the fashion of the day he addresses her in language of fanciful sentimentality but his passion is pure and loyal this is sir goodwins folly the old man loves as young men only ought to love madly and without regard to prudence from the moment when the baronet and the lady are brought together the interest of the story turns on the question will they marry i and this interest is cleverly maintained till the close of the third volume the positions of the lover and amanda are constantly being changed and the readers anxiety to know the end of the wooing is heightened by each change of circumstances all that relates to this main current of the tale mr locker has managed excellently frederick starlinghurst the welldescendedrowis a personagewho eouldnot have been portrayed by a writer not conversant with the world of existing society as well as with the life of george the thirds town the baronets daughters are excellently drawn and their prim severe but kindhearted governess is an original creation ably also haa the author caught the political spirit of the churchandstate men and of the disaffected classes the costume manners and amusements of the period are in like manner set forth with no ordinary power the painstaking fidelity of the artist being apparent in the social descriptions although he never burdens his pages with extracts from his notebook the story however has important faults and blemishes which it would be wrong to pass without notice instead of confining himself to the history of sir goodwins folly which affords ample material for three volumes of writing mr locker has crowded his scenes with characters and having brought them on the stage has with wearisome conscientiousness expended labour in making them say and do much that in no way promotes the action of the drama young beginners observed haydon of artstudents are apt to intrude all  they know not considering that the first requi  site is to please the eye through the eye  a  mnltiplicity of parts

way i peculiarly susceptible of treatment by writers  for the stageand avoided superabundant j characters and burdensome digressions we j should have spoken of his novel in higher j terms as it stands however sir goodwin folly belongs to the superior grade of prose fiction and we lay it aside with a feeling that its writer may produce a better book  sir goodwins folly in this story mr locker occupies ground which although not wholly new to the writer of fiction has perhaps been made less use of than we might have expected the period of the french revolution and the fearful and sanguinary events connected with it have it is true formed the staple of nmany french stories and as in mr dickenss  tale of two cities found a way into english fiction but the agitation caused by that mighty event in england though of an infinitely milder character the outer ripples of the surface of society here caused by the casting of that modem babylon the capital of france into the sea of revolutionary outrage which nevertheless inaugurated a new epoch of european progresshave never been very enmphatically noted by writers of this class on our own side of the channel the matter may possibly have been thought hitherto more pertinent to the province of the historian than the novelist but in its social aspect it is manifestly not wholly unadapted to the purposes of the latter mr locker impressed as it appears with this view opens his narrative in the midst of the period referred to in 1795 when among certain sections of the people in this country and certain political circles most unmistakeable signs were evinced of a tendency to fraternise with revolutionary france but these circles and parties were of two very distinct characters while one undoubtedly such as that headed by fox and other distinguished public men applauded loyally the principles upon which the revolution was commenced another in a lower stratum of society was prepared to go to almost any length in admiring advocating and even adopting the practises of the revolutionists between these might probably be reckoned a third class represented by such men as horn tooke thelwall and other members of the london corresponding society who to a respectable station and intelligence united a more intimate knowledge of and sympathy with the classes below them both in their wrongs and sufferings despite indeed the ferocious loyalty which surrounded the throne ad ostentatiously displayed itself in the house of commons and the squirearchy in general so deep was the discontent caused by the political

fiction sinister street by compton mackenzie martin i secker 6s t here are five hundred closely printed pages in t this book yet we are informed that it is but the half of the novel and that the other half will follow early next year there is nothing here that is not as it should be but we do feel inclined to take mr mackenzie aside and complain to him when we find that in spite of those five hundred closely printed pages the novel has not even begun it has not even begun in the most elementary sense of giving us someone to be interested in the present book purports to recount for us the life of one charles michael saxby fane until the time when he orders his thoughts towards oxford and the most exacting lover of detail will not deny that facts and details enough are given of the life supposed to have been led by that same charles michael saxby fane but the unfortunate fact is that he has not yet begun to exist he is but a name that serves as an excuse for an elaborate description of childhood and school affairs it is not until page 350 that some of the names begin to distinguish themselves into personalities and even after then the i distinction is not developed that is to say the characterisation is not worked out whether in terms of action or psychology and when the book concludes the potentialities of conduct and therefore of interest still do not exist when such a state of affairs occurs with a novelist of the promise of mr mackenzie it is interesting to see how it has been caused to be compelled to deny at the end of a considerable book that there is no such person as its ostensible hero is not sufficient that is only a method of evasion and if nothing else prevailed mr mackenzies standing as a novelist protects him from that easy device and when we come to examine the book closely an interesting artistic problem reveals itself that happens incidentally to concern in its implication a good deal of modern work in the novel for the novel is not a hotchpot into which anything and everything may be emptied the position of each detail is exactingly circumscribed by its significance any portion of any description that is not there for the better understanding of the central concern is just so much waste tissue and the natural result of the inclusion of such indeterminate matter must be that the central concern will be hindered in its proper development that sounds academic enough to be sure and though every defiance of academic statements is all to the good yet mr mackenzie does not justify himself there is for instance a chapter entitled characteristically enough unending childhood and in it is little that could not with advantage have been eliminated fane might have had to repeat mensa mensa mensam and so forth in a meaningless ceremonial we ourselves had to do so but we suggest that it is nothing to the purpose that we should be told of it fully we donot presume to say that to mr mackenzie that ceremonial had not some significance but he has not conveyed it to us and that is the test of the book in fact it seems to us that mr mackenzie himself has felt this for he bends his mind to making these endless details interesting for themselves by his witty telling of them and that is excellently legitimate though it does not alter the fact what is it to us that we should be told of the paper flowers that michael made at the kindergarten or of his difficulties with et and iny in the special  had these things with many other such details fully told been cut out would the book have suffered  we are compelled to answer our own question by saying frankly that the book in its present form would have suffered such details have come to occupy so large a part that the chief interest is derived from them and not from charles michael saxby fane on whose account they were ordered we are quite sure that this was not at all what a novelist like mr mackenzie meant he quotes at the outset the passage from one of keats letters to the effect that the imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in a ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain the ambition thicksighted that is as it were his text every external incident therefore only has significance in the degree in which it refers to this factor otherwiseof psychology but he has turned aside from artistic restraintor let us say more precisely his restraint in artand let himself loose in details that have not that significance with the result that they have crowded out the exposition of adolescence he intended have banished michael fane and reign in his stead yet even here a curious thing transpires for the events of the latter half of the book are in themselves a great deal more interesting than the events of the first half while being at the same time a great deal more in exposition of the personality that fane in consequence begins now slowly to acquire it is with the later introduction of michaels friend alan and the contrast that mr mackenzie now sets himself to display between the two that the wheels of the story begin to grip the metals but the whole fault of the book at least thus far is that it is not depicted from within outwards but from without inwards often not reaching the inner complication of nerves and desires blood and emotions and resolutions at all that is even the case in the episodes of adolescence though these are described as vivaciously as we should expect from mr mackenzies pert the lack of condensation has indeed taken off the vivid glow from his style but its general witful attitude remains though it shines no more and this is especially so with regard to the latter half it is not altogether easy to arrive at conclusions since the book itself does not our judgement is left like our interest in midair it would seem that mr mackenzie never intended originally to publish the book in two halves if he had he would probably have made each half selfcontained and selfconsistent and this particular half is neither one nor the other going lamely and uncertainly as a consequence the other half is to be expected next year perhaps the two halves will fit perfectly together and give each life if they do we shall rejoice yet at the moment our interest remains in suspended animation  fiction social studies sinister street by compton mackenzie vol ii martin seeker 65 another six hundred pages concerning michael fane  we will pay mr mackenzie the compliment of believing he could have conveyed in half the number of pages all that is essential to the understanding of the two phases of his heros life here treated wo can also affirm that there are few pages which do not carry the reader on with fresh zest book iii is a vivid presentment of oxford life though we are glad to know that detailed as it is it is not a complete picture the hero is now more than ever the young man cursed with the knowledge that all possible precautions have been made against its ever becoming necessary for him to earn his own living occasionally he is vaguely conscious of a desire to be something more than a consumer all his life  more often he is merely depressed by the futility of things as he sees them he takes part with relish in drunken orgies accompanied by a burst of destructiveness which would have been an outrage if carried out by a suffragette or a german but which many may consider creditable in his case for at the bidding of his proctor he cheerfully provides the money for the wages of those who have to repair the damage never does he reflect that his recurring satiety is obtained at the cost of many others who have no such chances his habit of oxford attitudinizing is cleverly conveyed in one of the authors comments he  consoled himself for the absence of subtlety or cleverness hi such an answer by the fact that at least it was a direct statement of what he thought once during his varsity career he is shocked by the thought that he may have some direct responsibility for the death of his mothers friend who had looked to him for sympathy in his failure to woo his sister in book iv entitled  romantic education mr mackenzie secures a striking contrast by plunging his hero into the nether world of london  down  from oxford and finding himself at a loose end  common to this type of man he turns into a musichall and thore learns that the girl he had made love to six years before has become a prostitute infatuated with the power of his personality he conceives the idea that he can save her by marrying her thus securing the opportunity to make a bigger fool of himself than ever throughout the two books which comsose this volume there are many ashes of intuition as to the contemporary leniency towards hypocrisy but we doubt whether the author meant to make his hero quite so criminal a fool in his efforts to help his fellows as he will appear to those who have to combat the misspent efforts of such people the heros friend is on occasion too obviously used as a stalkinghorse to draw forth clever disquisition and so has to appear more foolish than he really is our grasp of one character at least the heros mother is strengthened in this second volume    dearest boy i ia on though committee of a society for the abatement of london street noises   so deeply occupied with reform he said patting her hand   one must do something she smiled we thank mr mackenzio for that so far as his hero is concerned we cannot sum him up any better than we did in reviewing the first volume   his failing is the lack of a guiding principle sufficiently strong to counteract the relatively cheap allurements of life if he was as is suggested received into the roman catholic priesthood that mighty organisation may have converted a waster into a useful citizen if so it was an achievement more notable than any set down yet by mr mackenzie if this delineation brings home to any their responsibility for imbuing our enemies with the idea that we are a decadent race unworthy of our christian ideals then mr mackenzie will serve a moral as well as an artistic purpose we do not however expect so much from it the author with scathing irony depicts his hero as himself resenting  life given for the sake of thousands more unworthy living comfortably at home in the writing we admire most the authors wealth and appositeness in though choice of words on the other hand some sentences are in need of revision  sinister street volume ii by compton mackenzie martin secker 6s the temptation to write a long disquisition about this book is strong yet must be resisted space not permitting it and it is a pity for sinister street provides rich material for controversy itself touching upon so many profundities phases and ideas it provokes criticism to an unusual extent moreover it culminates in a conversion to rome this part is the weakest in the book for its reason is not obvious nor has the author taken pains to explain it one has to take it as it were cum grano for the rest the novel is genuinely interesting the picture of oxford of the good young man an english type passing through that delicious phase of youth is quite admirable then there is londonbohemian london the  gay life mr mackenzie is plainly half philosopher half esthete he can speak from the inside of women he is fearless sincere an artist if the conversion is rather temperamental than convincing it is suggestive as all the work of this author is he understands the lilys of this world altogether this is an arresting production a performance of literary merit  sinister street by compton mackenzie vol i martin secker 6s it may be that the dread prospect of the return of the three four or fivevolume novel determined the library censors to put their ban on this book when novels so popular as mr bennetts run into trilogies when even translations from french books such as jean christophe are published in england tetralogically messrs smith mudie and co may well have paused before committing themselves to the twovolume immensity of mr mackenzies new enterprise but these censors whose selfordained function it is to preserve the ignorance of youth have sufficient reason for banning this book if discussion of sex and sexuality is a crime any openminded reader of his novel will be convinced that mr mackenzie is attempting in a sincere and philosophic spirit to consider the supremely important effects upon character of the awakening of the sex impulse in youth this is very far from being the whole of his theme this influence is one among several supreme influences which he notes and analyses but it is a fact that he does give it a preponderance such as has probably never been assigned to it before in an english novel we welcome it as a sincere attempt to grapple with an important problem which not only every schoolmaster constantly discusses but which every headmaster in orders constantly preaches about in chapel before the whole of his school mr mackenzie happily does not preach for it is the business of a novelist not to preach but to present and to allow readers to come to any conclusion didactic or otherwise according to their fancy what we are concerned withbeing convinced that mr mackenzie has no arriere pensieis his truth to life and character he is addressing himself to a task similar to that of rolland in jean christophe and showing us the evolution of a boy who in the next volume is to become a mana boy sensitive yet masculine impressionable yet active ardent yet philosophic and brilliantin a certain sense a type and in another sense a superman or rather superboy michael hishers is the son of a mrs fane not married to that dimly shadowed father the earl of saxby michael and his sister stella are the loveproducts of this unrecognised union and both of them set out upon their exceptional yet representative careers we find it hard to be convinced by the psychology of michael the baby and small boy mr mackenzie probably resembles the rest of us in forgetting his own impressions at the age of two and in attempting to reconstruct the infantile phantasms of reality he is no more successful than he was in carnival or than m rolland was in jean christophe but no sooner has his hero gone to school than he begins to live for us as well as for himself this sinister picture of the foolish satire of masters the fashions and aspirations of small boys the keen zest for work and games and weariness of them the vast absorbing and sometimes hated institutional atmosphere of the school is a more faithful picture of publicschool life than anything we know in english fiction where mr mackenzie perhaps errs is in the emphasis he gives to certain exceptional influences in the life of his hero nearly all schoolboys are extraordinarily sentimental and extraordinarily religious but michael is a theologian many clever schoolboys are in danger of becoming aesthetes whether it be of the george moore or the oscar wilde type but michael outdoes them all nearly all of them are addicted to love affairs and take an interest in questions of sex but michael is more than most boys exposed to the violent surprises of knowledge but if mr mackenzie attends to this question very closely and actually gives it a greater importance than it seems to merit that is because he is attending very closely to all the remarkable influences which may be exerted upon an impressionable and exceptional boy we think that he has considering his whole scheme attempted a task which is rather too large for his philosophy but his characters are alive the school is a veritable hive of bees and drones we recognise it as a characteristic forcing ground of youth undoubtedly mr mackenzie has written a powerful and zestful book which the censor has advertised to the advantage of those whom he has introduced to it,unmarked

the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity,unmarked
the eye witness and his evidence about many wonderful i things by charles allston collins low bou anli co there is a rare charm of fresh lightheartedness in these essays which most people have already read and liked upon their first appearance in all the year round they represent certain quaint aspects of english society with perfect truth and with an unforced whimsicality of suggestion that differs greatly from the laboured fun of the hack comic journalist while seeming to have been in some degree suggested by it the satire is so goodhumoured the little touches of exaggeration all arc so spontaneous in their gaiety and the comment whether jest or earnest is so free from all vulgarity of taste that the reader never wearies of his gossips company them is an individuality too in the book light as it is and imitative as it is in some respects that promises much for the future success of the writer as an average example of his skill in fair and genial caricature we may qnote mr charles collinss instructions for tasting of wine at the vaults let no man suppose that he knows how to drink a glass of wine till he has pssecd through a curriculum of dock studies and has matriculated in

to attend to the exprsion of his countenance which is to be that of a gentleman of a suspicious nature and incapable of being taken in let us now recommend our winetester to apply the light test and to hold his glass up to lamp or window as the case may be in order that he may get a notion of its transparency having done this the monysyllable bum may be softly and slowly allowed to pas from the amateurs lips itisa good phrase and nless he frowns which it is not at present desirable that he should do unless the wine is obviously thick he commits himself to nothing theeye test having now been applied we should next recommcud a recourse to the organ of smell and here there is no doubt of it a slight frown may under any circumstances be judicially allowed to distort the features at this point too he is to put his head a little on one side to put his nose very near the mouth of his glans and to sniff sharply and irritably two or three times let it be owned that we are working our amateur a little bard yet this is nothing to what is before him when he once gets the wine to his lips it is thenit is at the moment of raising his wineglass to his mouththat the taster is to commence a system of harassment with regard to the owner of the wine which is to know no limit and which no humane or friendly considerations are to be allowed to mitigate retaining the slight frown used in the nos test our amateur is now recommended to fix  his entertainer with a pitiless glarenot however turning his face towards him but on the contrary getting it a little away from his victim and regarding him even if he is his dearest friend suspiciously out of the corner of his eye there will be no harm at this stage in the proceedings in making two or three  offers  at the wine before sipping it this is on the contrary a cours strongly to be recommended as it suggests that really your mouth is too serious a property to be treated lightly and that you must think twice before calling its attention to a wine that may be a failure at the tremendous moment when the first sip of wine actually pawse our amateurs lips he must on peril of losing the whole of the prestige gained for him by a careful attention to all that has gone before withdraw the glass smartly from his mouth and look down at it as if it had offended him then his glance having gained new strength by this relaxation must be brought swiftly back to his entertainers countenance and a look of malignant penetration must be screwed out of it that shall find its way into that sufferers inmost vitals the mouth mutt now be stretched as nearly as posble across the face the lips being compressed to a degree that renders them invisible and tightly closed they remain there only however for a moment and are almost instantaneously pushed out till they are on a level with the tip of the nose the lips retained still in this position are next to be moved slowly from side to aide and occasionally by a use of the muscle called e orbicuis orei are to be made to revolve which it will be found adds great effect to the air of dark mistrust hitherto expressed only by the eyes the whole of these exercises having been got through and repeated several times the wine may be at lastif the taster cannot resist itswallowed but it will be more effective if he rejects it after a and spits it out upon the ground the description is long few writers could have made it so long without using superfluity of words and yet the length in this case honestly comes of the minute detail of weumade and wellrecorded

left him the iconoclast of his earlier work has become a philosopher an artist rather than a reformer but with the change there is a perceptible tenuity in force and spontaneity some of the characterisation seems overcharged miltoun the lord is surely overdrawncertainly he is not a type and his behaviour on various occasions seems curiously at variance with the aristocratic  sport  of today who marries on the stage or seeks a plutocratic wife in america however by patrician  mr galsworthy may have had some distinctive type in his mind to us he is almost inhumanhe leaves a want so too does the  outsider  surely be would have taken this juno of a  babe  in his arms well well mr galsworthy is early roman there are delightful things in the book touches of exquisite delicacy of observation perhaps the strange thing is that mr galsworthys plays are so dramatic while his novels are so austere the patrician is like a beautiful frieze on marble it marks the writer of it with his strife and certain short stories as our first english writer  fiction tile patrician by john galsworthy wm heinemann i 6s mar arnold bennett once said in a series of academy articles since rebound under the title  the truth about an author after referring to the utter worthlessness of the mass of novels  there remains the work of the true artist the work the reviewer himself admires and enjoys say one book in fifty or one in a hundred the reviewer reads that through such a book is  the patrician the work of a true artist the book we certainly read through with admiration and enjoyment it is a distinguished book by reason of its style and because of the exactness and perfection with which the portraits of the characters are worked in upon the brain until the reader is confident that not merely would he know them if he met them in the street but would recognise them by their voices in another room lord miltoun the eldest son of the earl of valleys en route to the house of lords proposes to pause until that time comes in the house of commons where it is rightly expected that his marked abilities and family influence will give him both place and authority he is of the highest personal character a high churchman an instinctive aristocrat who takes to politics naturally and seriously but this is not a political novel though working itself out in a political atmosphere there is a woman in the case and therein lies the human interest down in the country within his fathers sphere of territorial influence a byelection is taking place and although lord miltouns supporters regard his chances of success as practically assured every vote is wanted the rumour gets abroad that lord miltoun is attached in some way better not described to a lady living down there in a separateness understood to have been obtained in the divorce court an assault is made one night upon one of lord miltouns opponents charles courtier and lord miltoun emerges with mrs audrey noel from her little house to his rescue the fat promptly blazes in the fire courtier is her great friend and regards her with the tender and protecting interest of a brother but lord miltoun is deeply in love with her  he had reached the age of thirty without ever having been in love leading a life of almost savage purity with one solitary breakdown women were afraid of him and he was perhaps a little afraid of women she was in theory too lovely and desirablethe halfmoon in a summer sky in practice too cloying or too harsh theirs was a chance meeting due to an accident to the little boy of a tenant he was visiting audrey noel was carrying the child home he found out her name  some days later passing by the village green he saw her entering a gardengate on this occasion he had asked her whether she would like her cottage rethatched an inspection of the roof had followed he had stayed talking a long time    thus from a chance seed had blossomed swiftly one of those rare friend ships between lonely people which can in a short time fill great spaces of two lives the vicar informed him that she had been the innocent party in the divorce suit he decides to marry her goes to london to inform his father who is naturally not too enthusiastic travels back through the night and without considering for a second the relation of the hour to the task arrives so early that she greets him so you have come to breakfast how nice of you he neither sat down nor suffered her to sit but stood looking intently into her face and said i love you and suddenly panicstricken lest he should take back those words she put her hand up to his breast and said and i love you when will you marry me p she hands him a paper containing this paragraph  apropos of the outrage on mr courtier we are requested to state that the lady who accompanied lord miltoun to the rescue of that gentleman was mrs lees noel wife of the rev stephen lees noel vicar of clathampton warwickshire when he had read the little paragraph there followed one of those eternities which last perhaps two minutes he said then  its true i suppose p and at her silence added  i am sorry at last he spoke  i have made a foolish mistake it seems i believed you were free her lips just moved for the words to pass  i thought you knew i never dreamed you would want to marry me is there no release   none we have neither of us done wrong besides with hitm marriage isfor ever the story of that crisis is told in chapter xv one of the most wonderful chapters in this memorable book we shall pursue the story no further we leave our readers

terence mcgowan the irish tenant by g l tottenham smith elder and co the irish question has been done in conventional prose ad nauseam as we noted a few weeks since it has not escaped a record in romantic poetry and here we have it in the form of fanciful fiction we can fancy the halfcontemptuous impatient gesture with which most novel readers would throw this book aside on the mere perusal of its title the author too seems to have had some misgivings as to the reception of his work for he has written a halfapologetic preface to it in which he says notwithstanding its suspicious title i feel myself at liberty i think to assert that this book is not a pamphlet in disguise i am rather presumptuous enough to hope that if any one will read it and if it is as truthful a representation as i believe it to be of existing social relations in ireland it may act in some measure as a corrective of a good deal of that literature for which mr gladstone recently returned thanks and dispel perhaps a few of those erroneous impressions regarding ireland which have been sown broadcast through the kingdom of late by casual and special tourists in the country after this handsome explanation and apology we forgave mr tottenhams audacity in mixing irish politics with light literature and proceeded to read his novel which we may as well say at once we found pleasant and interesting reading the cloven foot peeps out occasionally in rather longwinded discussions of party views between a rigid conservative dowager lady eleanor rochfort and a tory of a somewhat milder type lord shirley which are made the media for talking at if not directly talking of certain great politicians of though present day but this aside there is genuine romance in the story none the less interesting because we have too much reason to assume its foundation in stern fact moreover the picturesque descriptions with which the book abounds and the light genial almost brilliant style in which it is written would go far to make even a heavier mixture of the land question palatable the story is one which has had in times past and possibly has now its counterpart in many districts in ireland that of a kind careless and indulfent landlord idolised by his tenantry who regard im with almost patriarchal veneration he dies and the property heavily encumbered finds a new landlord with different ways to his predecessor rents are raised tenants evicted farms joined the old landmarks removed murderous passions evoked by mercenary greed till the once smiling if not perfect landscape is clouded and bloody with agrarian crime when the tale opens allan rochfort is the proprietor of geraldscourt which his family has held since the founder sir gerald rochfort a distinguished soldier in the reign of elizabeth concerning this gentleman we are told  cromwells celtic remnant had their strongholds in the mountains immediately around and made him continually aware of their existence in many bold and ingenious ways his cattle were houghed and carried off his retainers were murdered he was besieged himself in his own castle and it was a very odd thing if he ever had a crop to his name they were extremely pleasant neighbours these exasperated celts who knew that no one would be foolhardy enough to follow them into their own domains and therefore played off their little amenities upon country gen tiemeuwhom they con sidered as intruders with much the same impunity as they are humanely permitted to enjoy at the present day gradually however the kind treatment of those immediately around the invaders residence began to make itself felt in widening ripples  and as the years passed on and the indifference of long habit began to render the peasantry more acquiescent in the appropriation of their property a more conciliatory demeanour came to be adopted an attachment sprang up between the lord of the soil and his unwilling dependents and the oppressor by degrees became looked upon aa a benefactor successive generations fostered the growing feeling and mutual goodwill and kindness slowly broadened down from precedent to precedent until it reached the enthusiastic devotion which the tenantry of the geraldsoourt estate felt now for allan rochfort their present landlord geraldscourt is mortgaged to the last shilling it will bear and its indolent and thoughtless owner troubles himself as little as possible regarding its j future his tenants pay him as they like and aa j they can his boy that should have been his leir is dead and allan feels less interest in though he truly loves a beautiful girl that calls him father phelim mcgowan and his wife tenants on the geraldscourt estate are thanks to the industry of their elder son terence tolerably well off the younger larry is however a goodnatured idle graceless dog who has married and settled in a cabin on a strip of his fathers land as a specimen of the authors humour we quote a description of this latter gentlemans wardrobe your ordinary pauper or beggar has no sentiment of attachment to his rags and allows them to drop off by degrees until he is obliged to beg borrow or steal to replace them the irishman on the contrary understands the philosophy of clothes and furnishes in his nether garments a curious and interesting illustration of the constaut change which is always going on around us in the natural world every seven yean we are told owing to the continual discharge of old particles from our bodies and the constant accretion of new ones we get an entirely new body similarly at certain intervals determined by no fixed law the irishman will be found to change his clothes owing to the continual absorption into their system of black brown blue or grey patches and the gradual discharge of the original foundation so it was with larrythough how many phases he had already passed through or whether the black cloth the yellow corduroy the prey stuff or the brown nondescript which each had their due shane of representation was the elemental matter from which wa garments had originally proceeded is a luoretiaii difficulty which may best be commended to the notice of mr cany or any other

ohara the fostersister of nora the squires daughter he of course has a riyal in a crafty and welltodo tenant on an adjoining estate and the feud between these two furnishes some excellent passages here and there throughout the first volume the representation of the county in which geraldscourt is situated has long been held in the conservative interest by the hountstewart family lord shirley the eldest son however now finds that the priests are preparing an opposition candidate in the person of a radical mr brady a pettifogging rascal and a lawyer to boot shirley comes to canvas the county and is the guest of rochfort where he is grandly received by lady eleanor rochfort allans mother a tory of ov ai tl w il w hi b s the deepest dye who is energetic among the eont stifciamryon

content himself with an avowal of her love and the promise of being his on ber fathers death if he chooses to wait this opportunity is brought about sooner than all parties anticipate the radical

importation of scotch farmers and in some districts  wholesale clearances calculating costs of eottage building  what returns this would bring in and what outlay that would  require and sowing golden opinions among the various j tenants he met who were delighted with the genial sympathy tl he showed in all that concerned them and looked forward to r his proprietorship with quite an enthusiasm of regard then  he returned to the still unfurnished house had a very simple  dinner and spent the evening over parchmentdeeds plans tl and letterwriting feeling what a field for his energy there t was before him and promising himself that he would teach  the neighbouring proprietors whose acquaintance he had notl  made as yet how even an estate in ireland might be turned to good account if a thorough good english system of management was introduced j b the property in fact knew itself no more mrj majoribanks is perfectly aghast at the improvin dence of the late owner who made promises to his i  tenantry of anything and everything they asked  which promises they implicitly relied on and they c even come to his successor relying on a continuance i  of the custom terence who failing to propitiate j j kathleens father has married her without that individuals consent applies to the new owner for the lease of a small farm which as a tenantatwill he has worked hard to improve and is met with most exacting demands of increased rent his brother larry fares even worse for his eviction is determined on meanwhile the arbitrary doings of the new owner of geraldscourt bear the usual fruit rebellion is rampant all over the estate threat1  ening notices are sent to the owner but despite  these as well as friendly warnings from neighbour  ing proprietors he continues on his evil way and at last the storm bursts in a manner better told in the graphic sentences of the writer it is rent day and the scene discloses mr majoribanks sitting in state to receive his dues  i for a time all went on smoothly enough  the leaseholders and what few had had no increase to pay seemed to have been put forward first then there was a movement at the lower end of the room succeeded by an expectant silence as a doggedlooking fellow comes forward fumbling in his pocket for his moneybag this was one whose rent had been raised as the landlord knew when he heard his name  and he felt that the storm was about to break there was a significance in the mans manner which was not to be mistaken  and the hushed stillness behind him and the increased crowd of heads at the doorway were in themselves sufficient sign that something of exceptional interest was taking place he waa a tomi time getting ont his money and the delay was rather trying at length after deliberately counting over what be meant to pay he laid it down without a word upon the tabletbe old rent j bartley counted it and announced the sum to his employer watching curiously to see what he would do  you are 216s short he said sternly without a symptom of flinching j  thats all the rent ever i paid before said the teuant putting his hands into his breeches pockets  and thats all  the rent i mean to pay today  so make the most of itn you were regularly noticed that you had to pay an increase for the halfyear now expired jf you preferred to leave the land you were at liberty to do so you have not done so and you must therefore pay the rent an if i was noticed exclaimed the man fiercely is it parin rent 111 be now for what myself and my own family wrought at these years back to make it give a crop at all when the land was no better than a bit of the bare moor so it wasnt and wasnt worth a shilling to buy out of face except for the labour it got that i gave it myself and that ii j  win rent or now bat ru not

rent and you tnowthe altjnativea notice to quit will be served upon foti forthwith if  the sentence was never finished at that moment a man fl istepped out of the crowd presented a pistol at the landlord las he sat and fired the report rang through the room and a shoat arose outside at larry mc gowan burst through the doorway which was cleared for his passage and a moment after was speeding away towards the covert we turn from this picture to one more congenial the marriage of libra with lord shirley and their reception by their tenantry at mountstewart j with the presentations speeches and rejoicings so i j illustrative of irish attachment and fidelity to those  whom they love and respect meantime matters have not progressed satisfactorily with terence the pistolbullet has been enough for mr majoribanks and he hands over the personal control of the estate to an exacting agent who influenced by the villain brady terences former rival insults the latter and pointedly refuses to give him a lease on the strength of a promise of which he has built a new house in i an evil hour too he demands rent for a strip of j land which terence has reclaimed and on being j remonstrated with caps it with a notice to quit this is the last straw to break the camels back i terence who has hitherto been a lawabiding cheerful and honest farmer becomes moody sullen  and haggard and it

incidents and characters points of description and of comment so full of excellence that we regret our inability to quote more of them there is a tone of truthfulness in the plot of this tale an air of vivid reality about its circumstances that invest its unpretentious two volumes with an interest superior to that often excited by larger and more elaborate works of fiction we congratulate mr tottenham on his novel it is not as he says  a pamphlet in disguise  but we defy any reader of intelligence and feeling not to feel the force of the illustrations of irish life and character here presented and their application to s the political events of the present day such a statement a true one of irish affairs cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on english minds and viewed i only in its principal and widest sense as a novel terence mcgowan has merits of a very high order,unmarked

shrewd christmas book  doctor birch and his young friends by mr m a tit marsh chapman and hall the eccentric movements of mr titmarsh will be a great puzzle to posterityif he should happen to make that distant and desirable acquaintance when we last shook hands with him he was pursuing the fine arts in a hnmble way in pocklington gardens but for the last year or so it would seem he has been assistant master and professor of the english and french languages flowerpainting and the german flute in doctor birchs academy at rodwell regis by what necessity pitchforked into that situation we have not uie remotest means of knowing nevertheless mr titmarsh is still mr titmarsh naturam expellas furcdhut nature comes wk all the same just as he violated the confidences of private lite in the ease of mrs perkins and made traitorous use of his opportunities of observation when he lived in the pocklington quarter he now shows up the family of the birches and unsparingly describes the various young gentlemen whom he helped to j teach at the rodwell regis academy  the doctor himself would seem to be a kindly man enough but deplorably ignorant with an insolent oxford puppy of a son and under uie thumb of a tyrannical old sister they have a roung nieee miss raby who is very pretty and very jioor teaching the children in the lower school for ber bed and board there were two lads at the school some seven years before mr titmarshs time sons of a captain out in india the younger of whom tended in his sickness by little miss raby like a sister the old woman getting all the credit and the thanks and the silk shawls from india had died and the elder first falling in love with his brothers nurse had run away and joined his father in ahmednuggar mr titmarsh learns this gradually having conj ceived a tender sympathy for miss raby and liking to hear her talk it is not at all clear to us indeed that he is not on the very eve of a declaration when what we may call the catastrophe of his present narrative arrives this is in the shape of young davison from india  the old pupil who revisits the school one morning suddenly pays ancient unsettled debts to the old tartwoman gets a holiday for the hoys stuffs them with bullseyes and polonies and carries off the governess such is the framework slight but sufficient in which mr titmarsh sets his juvenile portraits first comes the cock of the school champion major who is a large strong lazy goodhumoured blueeyed capable fellow as magnanimous as he is brave and the favourite of everybody then there is hulker who would be almost as great a favourite if he were not poor fellow so stupid  one of those honest generous active incorrigibly dull boys that fill one with love and pity and hatred of the latin grammar mr titmarsh shows his kindly wisdom in showing his sympathy with hulker then there are the briggss who are apt to sink low in the school and get bullied till a hamper from home mollifies persecution and a general feast in the bedroom sets all to rights next there is bullock a clever mean cowardly plodding carefol humbug who cheats the litue bovs prac tices usurp on the big ones and is  pretty sure to succeed  in the world ak there is duval who plunders tarts m a more open and gentlemanly way borrows halfsovereigns and brags continually of the splendour of freenystown county cork where his father drinks claret keeps foxhounds and forgets to pay doctor birch perhape we need not continue uie list as the boy includes the man the school reflects the world and with easy troth and unaffected humour are all its

the dowager or the new school for scandal loxdox saturday so iem vim 14 1840 reviews bv mis ore j vols hentley tm condition of a nations literature of that portion more particularly called thu helles ietlice is of far greater import than is always perceived even by the professed critic far hom involving a mero matter of taste and indicating only the intellectual grasp and refinement ofthe people it embraces no less than the whole round of their moral existence and throws ti trong light on their institution their habits their present capabilities and their future prospects thus thc declining literature of the 9 iealled silver age of latinity might have been tiken as a sign of approaching disorganization quite as trustworthy as that set forth in the pages of tacitus thus too the french literati ie of the eighteenth century so far foreshadowed tin coming revolution that it has since been itiolilily reckoned thc main cause of that catastrophe the literature of the fifteenth century we need not say was still more intimately connected with the changes going forward in the religious and political opinions of the great kuropean community everything indeed in connexion with literature is signiliciint the style the subjects the pervading spirit the moral consideration and even the pecuniary value are each the exponents of some peculiarity ia a nations condition exercising an influence on the destinies of the people hy the word morals is to be understood in this instance the whole range of habits political social and even material so that in many respects literature to be thoroughly understood must be studied out of itself in this us in iilinost all moral questions mankind are tinapes of their analytic habits  the intellectual man has been studied apart from the material a code of criticism has lieen established as available in all times aud under all circumstances and one common procrustean bed of t iste has been applied to the literature of all ciiintries it is not however by such a standard that the productions of a national mind cm be accurately valued the existing state of literature at any moment is a fact dependant on the whole circumstances of the moment on llie actual developeinent of the entire civilization with all thc external agencies by which it is at once excited and modified considering merely the canons of criticism the prevailing state of education the current acquaintance with rhetoric with the principles ol the sublime and beautiful or in one word with the si iencc and the art of composition it would he difficult to point out any vast difference between the actual generation of english writers and that which immediately preceded them  and yet the differences which distinguish their respective productions are many and salient the causes of such difference must be sought beyond the ordinary range of criticism and it will not lo lo talk of the decline of taste of genius ik ing at a discount or of a perverse tendency of writers to neglect those models and rules of art which made the fame or fortune of their predecessors of the changes which have taken place and ure still going on in the literature of our own countryand more especially agermane to the article before us in its fictitious narrativethe greater part in our opinion depends upon corresponding changes going forward in society itself lt is with novels as with the legitimate drama in both instances the audiences have changed and managers and publishers in their modern sub stitutions are following rather than leading the public taste to analyse these changes and to enumerate all the conditions out ol which they arise would be impossible within the compass assignable to a single article one of the most remarkable and pervading is the wider spread of literature and the consequent demand for inferior articles it is no longer the welleducated man of the world the philosopher or the studentthe naturally refined or the artificially polishedwho creates the demand and who consequently determines the fortunes of a new publication the public now addressed is of lower qualifications and the author cheerfully accommodates himself to a circumstance which spares him an infinity of labour and thought one immediate consequence is that no very high order ol mind being necessary for gauging the public intelligence the publisher becomes a better judge of the wants of his customers than the author if the author innot himself a mere tradesman  and it accordingly rests willi the publisher to determine the character of our literature from the returns of bis ledger be collects with statistical accuracy the sort of book which is wanting  and lie dictates to the author both the direction he is to take and the level he is to maintain another consequence of the new market opened to literature is the increased rapidity of its movement av ith the reduction in the value of the article demanded there coexists an increase of effective demand the supply of this demand while on the one hand it tempts or rather forces the author into a diminution of labour on the other has begot in the purchaser a diseased passion for novelty the latter acquires a habit of reading with rapidity  of reading without judgment and whatever tempts him to pause for reflection will throw him behindhand willi the march of publication if it does not thwart him by offering an insuperable obstacle to bis progress in this state of tilings the prolits of a quick return of capital acquire importance in the publishers eye lt is not the extent of sale but its rapidity that is chieily regarded and an indifferent manuscript purchased at a low price and driven through the inarki t at a handgallop is more esteemed than a valuable work whose purchase money is to be spread over many editions this state of the market combining with the increased diffusion of mechanical education bas also opened literature to a less qualified class of writers writing is a trade that requires no capital and all the minor talents excluded by their poverty from entering on other professions crowd eagerly into the publishing market thus in spite ol the daily increasing demand the market is effectually overstocked prices fall and the author who writes for bread the great majority of those who succeed in literature i is compelled to work with greater rapidity and to substitute the number for the inherent excellence of bis works at the back of these extrinie influences there exists a difference arising from a change going forward in the national manners a sort of intellectual effeminacy ariing out of a long peace and steady public prosperity the sympathies of the masses have lost something ot their healthy activity a cold selfishness and indifference to others have stolen over them which lune tended powerfully to introduce two very opposite phenomena in the literature of the day in one class of temperaments it has engendered a dislike to strong sensations of any sort a craving for the lightest species of amusement and a disgust for all sorts of writing which makes any very powerful calls on attention by pathos humour or even by an ordinary earnestness of purpose persons thus circumstanced whether plunged in the merest intellectual idleness or prtoccupicd by commercial or by political interests look to fictitious literature as a source only of pastime and repose  and it may be laid down as a rule that the greater the interests xvliich rest on the shoulders of the reader the nion iliinsy and trilling are the works of his predilection of another class cf temperament the very reverse may be predicted in the lower classes of society there is to be found an equal selfishness perhaps to that which reigns in thc higher but it is engendered by other causes their selfishness and apathy are for the most part the results of the severity of the struggle for existence and ofthe constant recurrence of uneasy sensations which while they blunt the sympathetic susceptibilities brace rather than overpower the mind with the loxver classes the desire for strong sensations predominates but these are not to be obtained through the ordinary channels of legitimate literature and for such readers are produced the atrocities of the newgate school the adventures of buccaneers ihe sea novels and other tales of course and exciting adventure without proceeding further at the present moment in this analysis enough xve imagine has been said to account to a certain extent for the phenomena xvhich mark the present era of literature and distinguish it from that of tue last generation the change is not wholly indifferent to criticism itself the critic as belonging to the public must of necessity adopt sonic portion of its prejudices like other more dignified persons he must find his nature subdued to the atmosphere in xvliich he lives ihit were ibis otherwise if critics and authors were not in fact the same individual it would be unfair in the former to place themselves in the higher regions of their art or to measure the anthills ol one generation by the standards of another and it xvould be as usclesas it is cruel ihe shrewdest critics haxe generally lived in ages of declining literature  and they have done little towards arresting the decline by though severity oltin ir dicta because they overlooked its

tugeru aram wthat has mr wills made of bulwers idea  what will mr irving make of mr willss version of i eugene aram were questions much mooted when we last glanced at what the theatres were doing they were answered on the seventeenth of april when the new play was produced at the lyceum before a crowded and sympathetic audience with every accessory of scenery decoration and costume which the most fastidious admirer of realism could desire mr wills has made a few interesting tableaux out of what bulwer executed as a romance and conceived as a drama to which he doubted his own ability to do justice but he has not made a good play out of it any more than he reduced the readymade tragedy of the life and death of charles the first to the conditions of a good acting drama mr irving makes the most and the best of m1r willss tableaux but he is overweighted by the disproportion of his part and he has to struggle against the inherent unsuitability of the story of  eugene aram for representation on the stage at all unless it were given in its entirety mr wills claims to have adhered neither to bulwers romance nor to hoods poem and in a certain sense he has written his play independently of either though he has taken some of his effects from both it would however be clearly unreasonable to expect that this play should be considered on its own merits only and not to some degree with regard to its proportion to and relation with bulwers novel to which the murderer of daniel clarke owes his posthumous renown outside the records of the  annual register and the  newgato alendar thus considering it the question is naturally suggested why did not mr wills inspired by bulwers idea of a lonely student possessed by remorse and fear out of which he is only partially beguiled by love and whose fate comes up with him just as he is about to marry a beautiful girl refer to bulwers view of how the subject ought to be treated in a dramatic instead of merely adopting it in its romantic form  he had bulwers own exposition of his notions on this point and he had the  fragment of the drama which bulwer commenced but did not proceed with and they make it clear that the novelist perceived and appreciated the nature and uxtent of the difference between the romantic and the dramatic capabilities of the story of crime and misery which had strongly fascinated his imagination bulwer turned the drama into a romance mr wills has turned the romance into a drama in the face of the novelists careful demonstration of the vital distinction in fact the antagonism between the two the novel takes up the murderers life at the point where it is most adapted for description that is for the reverse of dramatic treatment but the  fragment takes it up at the point at which the dramatic element is in its full force that is when motive is most powerful and action most prompt the  fragment might never have been fashioned into a good play but any play founded upon the life of  eugene aram which departs entirely from the method of the fragment must necessarily fail to be a good play in this instance the dramatic instinct has deserted m1r wills and he supposes the existence of a state of consciousness on the part of the audience such as the novelist has it in his power to iniduce by description digression or suggestion but which it is the dramatists business to create we cannot imagine shakespeare bringing the guilty queen on in the first act in macbeth bemoaning herself and washing her hands in her sleep and then the unravelling of motive and the description of the murder of duncan all done backward in a frenzied soliloquy but we follow the skulking figure of rudge the murderer of his master and of his fellowservant through all the pitiful stress of his dastard fear and his remorse which is never repentance until the author of  barnaby rudge discloses the secret with a sense that the exigencies of romance are adequately observed the failure of this dramatic instinct renders the first situation in mr willss play weak and incongruous why should the marriage of the only daughter of the vicar of an important parish with a village schoolmaster be a matter of rejoicing to everybody the vicar included  only it would appear in order that mr wills may not adopt the reasonable side of ibulwers story of a romantic girls love for a learned recluse not divided from her by a hopeless inequality of station while he equally with lbulwer does depart from the fact that euene aram had a wife living at the time of his detection in the revelation to his wife of arams crimeits motive and its perpetration having been made plain to the audience by a prologuethere would have teen an opportunity for the exhibition of true dramatic power in both author and actor an opportunity far more worthy than the declamatory incoherent selfaccusation at the feet of a bewildered girl to whom her moody lover has ever been a problem imposed upon mr irving in a scene impressive indeed demanding the utmost exercise of the actors peculiar skill but which elicits no spontaneous response apart from the tribute of admiration due to that skill because it is untrue to the facts to nature and to the previous indications of the piece in the soliloquy which follows the entrance of eugene aram it is certainly implied to the audience that the remorseful man is in love for the first time in his dark and mysterious life and one of the strongest points of analogy between mr willss play and bulwers romance consists in the conviction entertained by ruth meadows that she is eugenes first love just as a similar conviction delights and satisfies the sentimental madeleine lester of the novel but this theory maintained to the end in the one instance is abandoned in the other in a fashion which is destructive to the ideal of the murderers character as it is put forth in the first scenes it is difficult to believe that the play was written otherwise than piecemeal that the story of the motive for the murder of clarkewhich is neither that imagined by bulwer nor that which really actuated eugene aramwas not concocted for the purposes of the concluding scene so discordant is it with all that precedes it the defect of the play as a composition is the absence of any indication of a previously or actually existing passion in the man to whose past so terrible a history attaches which can explain or account for that history like bulwer mr wills rejects the view of eugene aram as a common thief and assassin but he displays nothing like equal skill in the substitution of a supposed motive for the real one bulwer went as near to the palliation of the murder committed by the schoolmaster as the ingenious representation of an idee fire a devouring passion for learning and the revolt of a gloomy morbidly selfconscious mind against the poverty which fettered all its movements could enable him to go in the  fragment as well as in the novel but mr wills following neither has failed to explain the eugene aram who comes upon the scene a melancholy man indeed but whose melancholy according to his own subsequent explanation of its cause would have barred the approaches of the passion of love that ilulwers eugene aram should have possessed an emancipating angel in madeleine lester is intelligiblehis crime had nothing to do with a woman that mr willss eugene aram should have fallen in love with the parsons daughter is inconceivable his crime having been inspired by the base deception of a woman and his remorse kept alive if he could have forgotten the woman and the crime well and good but he never does forget and the discord makes the whole thing unreal the want of dramatic proportion affects the other characters as well they have no individuality apart from their relation to eugene aram parson meadows is a singularly credulous not to say silly old gentleman with an accommodating indifference to social distinctions which we are inclined to believe was less common in england in the last century than it is in this and so deficient in perception that he could hardly claim with hamlet to know a hawk from a handsaw considering the facility with which he invites houseman one of the most ruffianly ruffians ever produced upon any stage to join the family party on the day before the wedding of his daughter dr primrose is a smart man compared with mr willss parson who has a number of pretty speeches to deliver about arams gentleness and tendt ress about his putting the worm in his path into a place of safety releasing imprisoned birds and winning his pupils hearts they are very pretty speeches indeed there is a good deal of prettiness in the play and a little real poetrybut the gentleness and tenderness of eugene aram have to be taken for granted he is from first to last under the absolute dominion of remorse his love is more full of self pity than of passion his self absorption does not yield to the wouldbe joyous influence of the occasion while yet there is nothing to excite the ever latent fear in his breast it is difficult by the way to conceive a more inconvenient fatherinlaw elect than mr meadows for a man whose dread of the mere passing presence of a  stranger  is so great that the mention of the arrival of such a person suffices to distract his attention from the pretty protestations of his bride on the eve of their wedding here again mr wills while adhering to a portion of bulwers conception of the situation neglects a material constituent in it the murderer in the romance knows who it is who is lurking about threatening to reveal his secret to boland lester but the murderer in the play displays terror at the extremely natural occurrence that it stranger has introduced himself to the notice of the vicar of knaresborough and yet he is wholly unprepared to find that the stranger is houseman his former accomplice again in the story of the dreaded and threatened exposure mr wills is in accord to a certain extent with bulwer but not far enough bulwers aram is a comparatively rich man at all eventshe is in a position to make the coarser villains scheme of clhantage feasible but the village schicolmaster who is going to marry the parsons daughter has no money to be bullied out of and is a likelier subject for the tactics of conciliation which has an eye to the future the concluding scenes which are unlike either the novel or the facts are constructed entirely with regard to the characteristics of mr irvings acting they are made for him as exclusively as his costume is made for him and they become him as well this is in this particular case interesting but it is not drama and in the end we believe it is a system which will be found to be as injurious to the actor as it is unjust to the dramatist it is the most infallible method of encouraging mannerism that could be pursued not mannerism in the higher sense of characteristic conception and rendering but the mannerism which is as often as not mere affectation and which lends itself readily to the purposes of burlesque it dispenses the principal actor in a liece from the finer kind of observation while it taxes his energies in one direction it leaves a whole set of faculties without demand upon them in another it tends to drive him into exaggeration on the one hand and on the other into the carelessness which comes from the absence of comparison and by placing every one else at a disadvantage it deprives him of legitimate assistance pieces made to order in this way are to true dramatic writing just what zuccheros pictures were to really artistic portrait painting in the present instance to only one person besides eugene aram is any interest even supposed to attach it is to ruth meadows his betrothed a part by no means illplayed by miss isabel bateman but hopelessly ineffective because endowed with no vitality except that of the circumstances inconsistent and unnatural because ruth is merely a reflet of eugene arams moods and characteristics bulwer took care to establish an interest in his readers minds for madeleine lester to depict her in strongly individual colours and to sketch her life and associates before he plunged her into the deadly peril of love for an undetected criminal to tell all about her enthusiasm her lofty visionary mind and the studentfancies she holds as faith but that a parsons daughter whom we meet as an ingenue presiding over a village choir lauded by her gardener as the household angel a being of white muslin blue ribbons poetry and posies should mingle the most innocent and orthodox piety with a declaration that if eugene arams hand were even stained with crime she would still regard him with the passionate worship which he has inspired is unnatural and unpleasant not only or chiefly because the sentiment is at variance with every principle on which her life has been trained with every other to which she gives expression but because there is no reason for its suggestion except the authors absorption in eugene arams supposed state of mind and his inability to shift himself to that of any other person however comparatively important in the drama so as to give consistency or vitality to the other characters it is no wonder that miss isabel bateman is artificial and constrained all through she has a most unmanageable lover to deal with one so totally selfengrossed that she is made to appear as she must feel an interruption whenever she is not merely a chorus and the fact is that the only real chance she gets of producing any effect of signifticance is during the brief interval when eugene aram is off the stage in his case also by far the most effective scene is that in which he is quite alone when in the churchyard the murderer in his unbearable agony of remorse makes abject confession to heaven the dramatist puts forth the best that is in him the sense of interruption and incompleteness is lost in that solemn scene full of breathless interest the solitude of the guilty soul isolated by its incommunicable grief is broken by the only commune which has no discord in it and for the first time the legitimate condition for the employment of crime as a motive of dramatic action the inspiring of pity and of fear is fully attained mr henry irvings acting in the character of eugene aram is quite up to public expectation he plays the part with wonderful minuteness elaboration of detail and variety of expression considering the limited range of the emotion and its terrible profundity the slight demand for subtlety in the earlier scenes because every one is perfectly willing to be deceived and the complete surrender of the later scenes in which the presence of houseman in one and that of iruth meadows in another is of no practical account he is unreasonably suspicious and uneasy and preoccupied all through the first scene with ruth but that is the fault of the text he has to interpret  the fine touches in the interpretation the despairing glance over the girls head as it lies on his breast the vague absent smile and the lapse into thought far away from her even while the love words are on his lips and the caressing hands are touching her the writhing under the torture of praise and love in the address from his pupils as it is inflicted by the lips of his bride the shrinking from the pretty details of the weddingall these are his own in the agony and terror of detection in the morbid dread of the poor remains of the man he has slain in his dreadful question to houseman  diditstir  throughout the whole of the concluding scenes mr irving displays increasing power and intensity of expression but the situations are unduly prolonged and in the concluding scene in the churchyard he has too much ground to cover it is impossible to follow him through the contortions of that final agony without feeling that physical effort has too much place in it that it is suffered to divide the attention of the audience with the terrible mental struggle destined to end in utter defeat and death in a proportion which injures the effect of the whole in that one instance only the play is better than the interpretation the words are faultless the action is overdone many other passages of considerable beauty adorn mr willss play but they do not suffice to rescue it from the sentence of mediocrity as a dramatic composition that it is very much better than many plays with which the public have been satisfied of late years is not weighty evidence in favour of either the play or the public but we are far from accepting  eugene aram as the best that mr wills can do the author of  medea and the man o airlie and even of charles the first with all its faults as a drama ought to produce lieces which certain actors should aspire to perform not only pieces which aspire to be percormed by certain actors in the inversion of the roles of dramatist and actor there is the decadence of both arts,unmarked

literature the writings of john greenleaf whittier 7 vols macmillan  co this edition of the works of mr whittier is intended at least as to the poems to be complete unless so far as there are hopes that the time  honoured author whose  brown dwarf of eugen  and  one of the signers date only from last year may add some postscripts of pleasant verse to the collection which now contains he says  all that i care to republish and some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself i should have omitted at the request of his publishers mr whittier has in this edition allowed the reappearance though only in an appendix of early poems which for many years he has banished as not worthy of his nameand as to which indeed it is not possible to say that his name will restore them to the favour with which they were received by american readers of sixty years ago when as he apologetically remarks  the standard of criticism was not discouragingly high the publishers object in persuading mr whittier to republish the things that he would rather not have written was  to make the edition so complete and retrospective that students of the poets career will always find the most abundant materials for their purpose and if we are to suppose that mr whittiers readers read not for the sake of his poetry but to give themselves a course of educational study on his career as a poet the appendix may certainly be useful to them tor the excess of juvenile efflorescence and the protraction of its period in mr whittiers case as contrasted with the fact of his nevertheless coming to a fruitage time are shown by the poems in this appendix and their dates to be exceptional and though the phenomenon is easily explainable by the cause mr whittier assigns for the popularity of his verse in its turgid immaturity it offers something for the student of the career to study if he will take the trouble to compare with mr whittiers literary infancy the literary infancies of other writers who earlier or as late as he like him eventually arrived at literary years of discretion but even from this point of view it is difficult to see any sufficient advantage gained to the world by overruling mr whittiers wisely critical judgement of his least meritorious productions the arrangement has however given him the opportunity of dismissing the tedious and unreal attempt in the school of scott  mogg megone which disfigured his former collected editions to the limbo of the appendix and thus increasing the honour to which his riper work entitles him from all critics who appreciate artistic unaffectedness and the grace of sobriety the poems of mr whittiers literary prime vary much in quality but all have at least the strength of manly common sense good taste and direct expression while many possess also either reticent and therefore effective pathos or a certain eager and orderly rush rather perhaps of orator than of poet but instinct with metrical vigour which has characterised some of his most popular pieces his boundaries have not been wide but within them he has been master he has been sure of his purpose and what he purposed he could effect and he has shown an understanding of his limits which is in itself a faculty of no mean order in england his poetry taking it all in all has not met with the wide and somewhat undiscriminating acceptance it has received from his own countrymen and only a few pieces can be named as having become favourites of our general public but we may fairly say that the restriction of the welcome on this side the water is quite as undiscriminating as its liberality on the other side for instance now that every one knows  maud muller why are there comparatively few who are familiar with  telling the bees  an idyl so tenderly and touchingly simple that we mean presently to quote it in fullwith  st martins summer with  mabel martin with  the new wife and the old  the suitability of  barbara frietchie and  skipper

tattered field  this is a fine piece of passionate rhetoric and has real fire in it still mr whittiers antislavery poems do not show him at his best as a poet indeed nobodys antislavery poems ever have been truly poems though some rare few have like  the pine  tree been very good metrical speeches the theme would seem on first thoughts just what must have made any man whose heart was hot about it and who could put feelings into verse at all capable of true poetry for that if for nothing else and must have inspired any true poet with dramatic force and lyric passion to make his least words on it immortal but second thoughts explain why the fact has been so much the reverse antislavery was not a theme for a poet it was too abstract too political and above all too argumentative a great poet might with one short drama one lyric one stanza nay one line about some slave who never existed but in his mind and his readers minds have found his way to human hearts then and for all hereafter as long as the english language lasts but there were in the antislavery agitation no poets who could or would write their poems on the slaves side so the antislavery poets were absorbed in the great public question with all its disputatious details they were in the thick of debates and arguments they wrote them with thought of their opponentsto answer to persuade or to attack poems so written may have their influence in a great public controversy but the controversy over their life is gone they are like weapons of an ancient warfareweapons we respect in the museums but that have no purpose in them for our days mrs beecher stowe in her own line of art managed better she used sympathies of human nature that belonged to all times and peoples and produced a novel which was genuinely a novel with the novels power to absorb attention to amuse and to move and which whatever its faults has lost nothing of that power by reason of the slavery question having become obsolete to her the theme does seem to have given inspiration beyond her normal faculty so that this one book of hers her worst as to some glaring bad qualities has in it a something amounting to genius which her other works can by no means parallel her imagination seems to have been aroused by her zeal while the zeal of the poets whirled their imaginations away and left it the only difference between their polemical productions and those of other able rhetoricians that theirs were in verse and had more similes in them much the same has always been the case with poets polemics weean call to mind no verse directly dealing with aay question agitating the public mind catting for any wrong to be righted urging any great measure which has had it in it to aurvive as poetry the success of its cause except mrs brownings  song of the children and that the  song of the children though intended polemically not only had aa influence on the public mind at the time bat stands forth a poem is because mrs browning with the high poets sympathetic instinct went at once forth from herself aad let her pleadings and her reasonings pass into the piteous simplicity of the thoughts and words of the childrenjust as she would have done in fact had their miseries belonged to ancient history or to an imaginary world to take mr whittier at his best as distinctively a poet we must go to his  poems of nature poems subjective and reminiscent and  narrative and legendary poems as is inevitable when a writer tries to classify his collected poems the series overlap and a piece that stands in one series might as fitly or more fitly stand in another  and it is the merit of the beet poems in these three series that they might all lay claim from one point of view or another to belong to the poems of nature  telling the bees  in the  narrative and legendary poems owes its charm to this and its tender implication and tu4 narration of the simple love and simple sorrow here is the place  right over the hill

with the appendix fill the fourth poetical volume is a set of poems which has only been got into group and made  occasional  by means of a prologue and some tags of conversation at the end of the

taylor the free cosmopolite declining to accept these oems the wreck of rivermouth the taids of attitash  kallundborg church  the worship of nature and suchas personal and occasional we confine our remarks to the pieces that rightfully belong to these headings when we say that this kind of verse is not so favourably appreciated in england as it appears to be iu the united states possibly all our poets too in their private life write verse to each other but if so they except in one or two exceptional instances do not publish it and they are not often called on for odes and hymns at  celebrations  and openings and anniversariesand so much the better the critic always feels regret when he finds the abilities of men with real gifts frittered away upon these politenesses of the prose there is no need to say much it does not compel blame it does not invite praise margaret smiths journal the editor tells his readers presents a tolerably lifelike picture of the past  unfortunately it does not the shorter tales also show that mr whittier has not that gift of vividness of making even transparent unreality seem true till the moment the reader leaves off reading which is specially the novelists the papers in the two other volumes are on  the conflict with slavery on politics and reforms on literary and historic subjects or are brief biographies of men and of books and tributes to contemporariesall of them manifestly contributions to periodical literature they have of course spirit and purpose we marked from one paper only at least a dozen passages quite amazing for inflation mixed metaphor and bad taste passing to another paper we found not one florid sentence the prose works are not dated but the difference in style must be a matter of dates and it may be reasonably inferred that the florid papers belong to the immature period and the better ones be taken as the true standard of mr whittiers prose,unmarked

minor poets and men of sportive wit and fancy as bays says  about the town seem to be the class which american genius will more quickly overtake and with some respectable exceptions it is precisely

strangers at lisconnel by jane barlow hodder  stoughton an authority on idylls says rather testily   after the use made of the word by tennyson in his idylls of the king which are epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragic in their incidents it becomes very difficult to say what may not be called an idyll this is cowardly to put the mildest censure on it surely a man and a scholar after reading poems epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragio in their incidents should find it very easy to say  there are compositions whioh may not be called idylls of such are these poems of the king i will not believe that even the shade of tennyson could be set aquiver by a quiet polite comment to that effect meanwhile it is here not so important to decide what is not an idyll as it is to deoide what an idyll is the word  idyll looked into is seen to mean  a little picture   and all the best idyllmakers from theocritus to jane barlow have given us little pictures for a little pioture it might naturally be supposed that one would ohoose a little subject a cottage rather than a castle little claus rather than big claus this again is what the best idyllmakers have always done even when the doing of it must have gone somewhat against the grain the great pastoral poet of greece makes an infamous act the theme of his eulogy because the doer of it was ptolemy the

very different they are from their brother  craftsmen whom we have known in the flesh if theocritus has drawn them truthfully the explanation of this fact is to be found in the time and the clime in

have succumbed to what to any but a grey eye or soan irish eye would seem lamentably lacking in matter for poetry it is impossible to praise in excess the consummate skill with which miss barlow has made anew little pictures of the loveliest with this drear lisconnel for background and in the foreground nothing brighter than the blue of mrs kilfoyles cloak for what painters call a point of colour

difficulties in which they constantly landed him his tone was now rather peremptory as he repeated what was there in it before the beginnin of everythin   sure nothin at all said his elder brother peter to whom the answer seemed quite simple and satisfactory but joanna looked as if ene had caught sight of some distant object which provoked hard staring   then what was there before the beginnin

not give it for two reasons i want the reader to go to the book and i want to give another passage you are to know that a theft has been perpetrated in lisconnel a thief has appeared there his appearance is followed by that of policemen it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of two active and stalwart civil servants would have been welcomed as happening just in the nick of time yet it argues an alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means possible the men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to the category of pitatyblights rintwarnins fevers and the like devastators of life that dog a man more or less all through it but close in on him a pitiful quarry when the bad seasons come and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin wid the hunger and his own heart is broke therefore to accept assistance from them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most reprehensibly unnatural to put a private quarrel or injury into the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the public foe a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a trivial temporary convenience lisconnel has never been skilled in the profitable and useful art of utilising its enemies not that anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments much less attempted to express them in set terms when a policeman appeared there was an inquiring mood what people said among themselves was  musha cock bim up i hope hell get his health till i would be tellin him or words to that effect while in reply to his questions they made statements superficially so clear and simple and essentially so bewilderingly involved that the longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle them there is a very general idea in england that irelands history has been written by moore lecky froude keating and some others and there has grown up a practice of late years of rather industriously studying these writers who are some of them interesting but are none of them quite reliable it is a curious fact that the writer who is the best historian that ireland has yet bad miss jane barlow is not only more reliable than any of the historians named above but is also immeasurably more interesting than any of them froude is considered by those who do not trust him wholly to have had a pretty wit it becomes very ugly when compared with wit like the above perhaps it is after all not for nothing that irish wit is accounted the prettiest

holdsworth mrs leehamilton from photo by elliott axd fry 55 baker 8rcet of the word the author has given it to us openhandedly in another the worst that can be said is that she has perhaps played tricks with our taste but even this we do not wish to believe if art may be defined as the employment of things to answer some special purpose the use of means to accomplish some end surely a fair enough definition then miss holdsworth has undoubtedly succeeded in giving us art she has used legitimate means to produce a delicate and absorbing book there are many rules in art but the main question once settled this author may be trusted not to violate single rules in the valley of the great shadow there are twelve chapters and these contain six deaths and three severe illnesses yet in many ways the book is a cheerful book and besides this it is terribly true mittenplatz the beautiful swiss valley isdespite its being the spot 1 where death and life waited together for the bodies of men bright and bracing and of perennial interest 1 when the snow flashed in the sun like silver and the jodels rang cheerily across the silence people forgot the sadness of the mittenthal but at night they remembered for then life slept and only death watched yet there were generally hopeful faces and smiles and sunburn that looked like health and gaiety and music with the great solemn white hills teaching calmness and patience the hotel royal where the men and women of this story live during the months in which we learn to know them is a real place no reader will doubt it we know its rooms with the sunshine on the windows its balcony with the row of chaises loxgues its stairs with babette toiling up and down and in this snowy valley and this homelike hotel we see a group of men and women fulfilling their destiny music abd harmony are in the book from end to end and the most dominant themes the most resonant insistent notes are courage and love which are greater powers than death and life such phrases as d the bells on the horses tossed the silence in little drifts about their heads such overfantastic phrases displease occasionally and are to be deplored but the book itself is not fantastic in style it is indeed singularly free from complexities and obscurities it contains wise and leautiful writing and is in spite of or because of its deeps and eddies as clear melodious and refreshing as a mountain stream  the valley of the great shadow new novels by annie e holdsworth heinemann mrs leehamiltons latest contribution does not err on the side of cheerfulness it is almost as lively as the chronicles of a workhouse infirmary  the valley of the great shadow to which the titlo rofers is one of those health resorts for consumptives in the eastern alps with which a popular work of fiction by miss harraden has taught novelreaders some familiarity mrs leehamilton seems to have become profoundly impressed with the curious combination of lungdisease and lovemaking we have not carefully enumerated the cases of engagements to marry and of deaths from chest complaints they alternate throughout the book and the leading medical man is not exempt for some reason or other the clerical element is not represented in the dramatis persona there is a disagreeable man who says  if a woman is not a fool she is a liar and if she is neither she is a confounded nuisance he too suffers ultimately from one of the two prevailing complaints there is a plainspeaking young american lady who is described as coming from kansas though she appears to have more affinity for philadelphia and there is an impossible or abnormal child which serves no good purpose in the story on the whole the volume is hardly equal to others by the same hand such as the gods arrive or  the years that the locust hath eaten though experience has added facility to the writers style  the valley of the great shadow by annie e holdsworth mrs leehamilton heinemann 6s an alpine health resort populated by doomed consumptives is necessarily rich in pathos yet one must complain that mrs leehamilton exacts too much tribute of it frankly we do not believe in the genius who was belated in a threemile walk with a child of six and perished of his fatigue in carrying her through a snowstorm nor are we impressed when miss blake attempts to toboggan out of this world because she is hurt in her selfrespect and disappointed in her affections and then when we are asked to weep over what may be called  dodo pathosthe giddy mother and the sick child  curtain  we loose our patience for be it

a tramps sketches the soul of a tramp by stephen graham macmil lan and co 5s net this book is a record of a walk along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and of a pilgrimage to jerusalem it differs markedly from most books of travel however in that the author is less concerned with the things seen along the line of route than with his own spiritual emotions and experiences as he himself says it is not so much a book about russia as about the tramp mr graham is among those who find salvation by going out into the wilderness he reminds one at times of thoreau there is the same impatience with the meaningless restraints of civilisation the same wild exuberant delight in the freedom of nature but whereas thoreaus withdrawal from the world had bred in him a certain scorn of humanity mr graham is overflowing with the milk of human kindness he finds friends everywhereamong the peasants of the russian steppes in eastern monasteries or turkish bazaars thoreau was alike by conviction and temperament a pagan the tone and temper of mr grahams book on the other hand are those of the christian so one is not surprised at the note of blitheness that runs through these pages often footsore the wanderer is never weary the world is full of unexpected delights there is the joy of the road the feeling of exhilaration that comes upon a man as he shoulders his knapsack and sets forth bravely into the unknown and there are quiet restingplaces at the journeys end sunrise and sunset the sound of the sea the music of birds darkness and the coming of dawnthese things become invested with a new meaning to the man who has gone out into the wilderness to find his soul he has time too to thinkand to pray and prayer mr graham would have us believe has an added effectiveness when offered amidst the silences of nature    prayers he writes are strong out of doors made in the presence of all the stars one is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there is calm all around and in ones own heart the mysterous beauty of the starry sky reflects itself in the soul and across its mirror sails the pale moon my own body becomes a cradle in which the little christ child

free for a few hours at least of the company of saints and heroes this much we owe to mr graham who has added to english literature a book that if we mistake not is destined to endure  a tramps sketches by stephen graham 5s net m5acmillan the reader may consider mr grahams book in two lights either as a volume of remarkably interesting reminiscences of life on the open road or as a powerful appeal to the modern world to forsake the worship of the golden calf the authors tramp was along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and eventually to the heavenly city in the company of russian pilgrims his pen paints delicate little portraits of the simple and loveable russian peasant it describes too with striking vividness nights spent in strange cities and in lonely shacks i slept with the bare world as my house the sky as my roof and god as host he writes and lest an incautious reader should exclaim  how lovely we hasten to add that like the apostle paul mr graham was often in perils of waters in perils in the city and constantly in weariness and painfulness but the author expressly states that his book is more concerned with the tramp than with russia  it is the life of the wanderer and seeker the walking hermit the rebel against modern conditions and commercialism who has gone out into the wilderness commercialism he says is at present the great enemy of the individual man and the only hope for salvation is first of all for a few to live their lives out to the full in order that all others may live their lives completely mr graham seems conscious as he writes that he is a prophet crying in the wilderness and even if some of his readers may consider that he is imagining a vain thing they will be constrained to admit that the pursuit of this ideal has one great merit so far as mr graham is concernedthe delightful record of his vagabondage  a tramps sketches by stephen graham macmillan and co this is another volume by the author of undiscovered russia a charming tour of a tramp a real tramps life along the caucasian and crimean shores mr stephen graham admits frankly that he is a wanderer by predilection a rebel against modern conditions of commercialism which threaten not only to destroy art but the very perception for artistic creation it is a delightful book redolent of the open air of the night of the great silences of expanse and yet full of incident of aperfus into russian conditions and the minds of peasants revealing a real spiritual and material sympathy both with the black earth and the monks of monasteries whose hospitality he enjoyed and with his fellowcomrades of the road it is life that interests the author here we can get it and it is like splashing about in a clear pool on a warm summers day spontaneous in inspiration mature in philosophic contemplation this sort of book gives a man honest pleasure more it sets his heart beating in unison with the author in harmony with the awe and beauty and

followers of landor browning and tennyson would at once denounce mr storybut we fancy that landor browning and tennyson themselves would see something in him to admire poets are not always irritable to poets but their followers affect the hostility of a clanship at the ago of sixtytwo mr story collects the labours of his literary lifehis poems covering a period of forty yearsfrom 1816 to 1857commencing when byron had only begun to assert himself before keats had published and when shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny when wordsworth and coleridge had few readers and when it was perversely held that poetry should be modelled on something that had gone before the varied reputations made iu forty years never seduced mr story from the path he originally chose beginning life as a northumberland herdboy he was  literally charmed by dr watts but springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration he dashed into a style resembling the minor flights of burns then as now most keenly loved and appreciated amongst an otherwise unread northern peasantry his poems are dated and usually have some two or three lines of historical gossip which give interest because clearly carrying truth the first poems are all lovemary k to the same to the same by the dozen when other ladies supplant mary precisely as we find in burns in 123 mr story wrote

through many dark years when it waved in the battles of right against wrong we have shown the elements of mr storys volume as a writer of songs following in the wake of burns campbell and allan

much of an heiress for lee let us be grateful since she means a much pleasanter atmosphere than can be breathed in any other of the books of this talented writer not too much of an heiress we have said but mrs athertons heroines demand a thick luxury for their graces and forces to develop in patience sparhawk and lee both know hardship in their childhood but that poverty can mean anything but

keynote this story like the last deals with the theory or practice of angloamerican intermarriage mrs atherton would protest one gathers against the blunt judgement which lumps all american wives into a single unflattering category after all she points out to us there is a world of difference between say your raw western heiress and the southern woman of good californian family with a century or two of delicate breeding behind her the former does not beseem a coronet the latter may meet an english noble with a pride of race equal to his own such a one is lee tarlton mrs athertons heroine her personality dominates the book she is well conceived and thoroughly alive we rejoice that she is beautiful for heroines with lank drab hair and squat figures pall on the reviewer but when to beauty she adds brains courage and a high sense of honour we feel that lord maundrell is a lucky man he too is well drawn though with a touch of transatlantic scorn for the impressive  set englishman the plot is not much the interest centres in lees development as a calif orman girl and an english bride over against her is set her husbands stepmother also an american of rank extraction who brings lord barnstaples fortune and good name to ruin he learns at last that the expenses of maundrell abbey are being paid out of her lovers purse and a strong scene between him and the truehearted lee follows  he was sitting at his desk writing and as he lifted his hand at her abrupt entrance and laid it on an object beside his papers she received no shock of surprise she went forward and lifted his hand from the revolver  must you p she asked  of course i must do you think i could live with myself another day  perhaps no one need ever know  everybody in england will know before a week is over she gave me to understand that people guessed it already  this seems such a terrible alternative to a womanbut  but you have race in you you understand perfectly my honour has been sold and my pride is dead there is no place among men for what is left of me and to face my son again good god  can nothing be done to keep it from cecil p  nothing it is the only heritage i leave him and hell have to stand it as best he can it wont kill him nor his courage hes made of stronger stuff than that and if ive brought the family honour to the dust he has it in him to raise it higher than it has ever been never let him forget that youve played your part well all along but youve a great deal more to do yet youll find that fate didnt steer you into this family to play the pretty role of countess    i am equal to my part  yes i think you are now i have an hours work before me i cant let you go till ive finished you are a strong creaturebut you are a woman all the same you must stay here until i am ready to let you go 11 want to stay with you  thank you sit down he handed her a chair and returned to his writing lord barnstable laid down his pen and sealed his letters he stood up and held out his hand  goodbye he said they shook hands closely and in silence then she went out and he closed the door behind her she stood still waiting for the signal she could not carry the news of his death to his son until he was gone beyond the shadow of a doubt it was so long coming that she wondered if his courage had failed him or if he were praying before the picture of his wife it came at last lord barnstable dies but the atmosphere remains electric we somehow expect that lord maundrell will follow in his fathers footsteps and that lee will fall into the hands of a magerful compatriot who has

new novels the heavenly twins by sarah grand 3 vols heinemann  the heavenly twins  is one of those books which it is difficult to criticise satisfactorily for in spite of its chaotic and haphazard arrangement and its unsatisfactory ending it is so full of interest and the characters are so eccentrically humorous yet true that one feels inclined to pardon all its faults and give oneself up to unreserved enjoyment of it the author is a lady who in the flippant words of the oxford magazine has come to believe in the mission of woman to civilise man to teach him to know his position and to estimate hers if he can but her ideas on the subject are dreadfully vague and though she gives some interesting cases of women who attempt the problem of readjusting the relations of the sexes their efforts are not crowned with much success there is indeed a shadowy personage called ideala who has organised a mysterious society for this purpose and for though propagation of a new religion and who it is hinted has obtained a solution of the difficulties but her utterances are too rare and dark to be intelligible the heavenly twins has been compared in a contemporary journal to 4 the story of an african farm the comparison is just inasmuch as both authors express a bitter sense of revolt against existing social arrangements both have a theory that to woman is reserved the future salvation of the world without any definite conception of how she is to accomplish it and in both books the intensity of feeling and the wealth of imagination are so great that the story is overburdened with a plethora of material which might with advantage have been distributed over several novels in this book there are at least two stories that of the heavenly twins which gives the book its title and that of evadne the wife who was no wife the twins angelica and diavolo young barbarians utterly devoid of ali respect conventionality or decency are among the most delightful and amusing children in fiction the conception of twosuch little monsters and the frank description of the superfluity of their naughtiness without encroachment on the domains of the improbable would alone have been remarkable  but to have made them at the same time lovable and to have related their unconventional escapades with the delicacy and good taste of  sarah grand shows something more than mere cleverness in the story of evadne which is really quite unconnected with the other except from the accident that evadne happened to know the twins the author has surmounted a great difficulty with success evadnes story is briefly this she is a thoughtful and clever girl of strong will who marries a man thinking him to be all that is good and noble on her wedding day she discovers that his character has been that of a  man of pleasure and she only consents to stay with him on the condition that they shall not live in the relations of husband and wife in spite of all protests from her parents and her friends and though it is represented to her that she might be the means of elevating him and she never swerves from her determination the difficulty lies not in making the reader intellectually approve of her position  the natural tendency would be theoretically to justify such a character but to regard her as almost repulsively cold and heartless especially as tne husband loyally abides by the arrangement and is represented as rather gentlemanly and pleasant than otherwise but in so vividly describing the state of her mind and the womanliness of her nature that the only feeling of the reader is sympathy and pity for her and this sarah grand has done she has created a true and delicate woman not a strongminded female made up of cold abstractions whom one instinctively thinks of ns wearing pincenez and short hair considerations of space permit us to notice one more point only in this bookthe quiet humour with which the author describes the characters she has the inestimable merit of hardly ever obtruding her personal views of them on the reader who is allowed to discover their peculiarities for himself gradually as if he were living with them this is especially the case with some of the minor characters mr hamilton wells for example the submissive father who makes tea and talks crude platitudes appears at first as if he were merely an insignificant bore  and that is how he would strike a stranger but closer acquaintance with him reveals the fact that he is a humourist of a high order and that the seeming platitudes are generally very much to the point in case another edition is printed it may be mentioned that either the author or the printer is shaky in french witness ilya deslonguers par envy dattaquer and the maxim given as  chercher la femme,unmarked_contra
  nadir shah by sir mortimer durand with illustrations constable  co sir mortimer durand has fallen between the proverbial two stools he has written a biographical romance which is at once too romantic to be a real biography and too biographical to be a true romance he confesses that he adopted this form  after some doubt because he found that  the existing accounts of nadir shah whether persian or european are hardly the material from which exact history could now be written no doubt  exact history is rarely to be deduced from eighteenthcentury persian or any other chronicles but a tolerably accurate biography of the great turkman conqueror might have been compiled which would at least have proved a useful contribution to history and would have been valued by students and even by orientalists to whom sir mortimer durands persian scholarship is known to such the present work without a single reference to original authorities is of little interest beyond showing the conception of nadir shahs character and career which an able man formerly resident in teheran and acquainted with the persian sources has formed even this has too much of the obvious in it and offers scarcely any originality we accept unreservedly sir mortimer durands assurance that his story is not  inconsistent with known facts and that he has done his  best throughout to treat known facts with proper respect  but since  this book does not pretend to be a history there appears to be no obligation to treat it with proper respect from the historical or biographical point of view taken merely as a romance founded upon history with the design of giving  more life and colour  to the story of nadirs career the work suffers from overlearning most of the romances in which the manners and modes of thought of the east and its  local colour  are sought to be imparted have been failures there are very few who possess mr marmaduke pickthalls happy gift and though sir mortimer knows persian and has been fairly intimate with upperclass persians we doubt if he knows the people as for example prof brown knew them when he lived amongst them or if he can think in persian as mr pickthall thinks in arabic the result in the present case is that the reader who is probably unfamiliar with persian ways is annoyed by frequently occurring words which he cannot understand and requires a glossary which is not supplied  the romance is burdened with archaeology and the action hampered by an attempt at historical accuracy which nevertheless leaves the reader unconvinced those who are already interested in nadir shah will read this romance of his life with appreciation but not because it is romance those who know nothing about him or his time will be perpetually puzzled and irritated it is not the business of romance to teach history and the mistake here made is not so much the founding of the romance upon an historical basis as the choking of the romance by too elaborate an historical setting the long accounts for example of nadirs campaigns have nothing to do with romance and are merely digressions perfectly justifiable and indeed necessary in a biography but out of place here the subject we admit lends itself to treatment as a novel or as a drama the rise of the turkman robber chief from obscure poverty to w ide empirewonderful though not unparalleled in the east the land of opportunities  the spoiling influence of success and the growth of arrogant ruthlessness under the sun of too favouring fortune the alienation of the affections of the people and finally the army by frequent acts of irresponsible injustice and barbarity culminating in the blinding of his son and the inevitable downward path pointed out by offended nemesis ending in the longforeseen assassinationhere are the makings of a tragedy sir mortimer durand has realised this clearly enough and has drawn the character of nadir with insight  but he is always taking our attention off the main subjectan interesting though not very unusual psychological studyto carry us away to campaigns and marches in places with outlandish names outlandish at least to the majority of readers which could have been sufficiently indicated by a few allusions without interrupting the development of the story the real romantic interest centres not in nadir but in the beautiful tender rajput girl whom he made his bride in india when he was crushing the mogul emperor here sir mortimer is fairly in the realm of romance for whatever truth there may be in nadirs marriage to an indian wife the story of her relations with the conqueror could never have been divulged but the introduction of sitara and her devotion gives the book its chief merit as a romance and also a real charm the indian girl is admirably drawndrawn with knowledge as well as sympathy the inevitable contralto to sitaras soprano the shirazi wife a particularly hateful characterrests on surer historical foundations for sir mortimer had traditions of her related to him by a persian minister who had them from one who had known her second husband residence in persia does not tend to exalted opinions of the people and we do not advise persians of either sex to apply to sir mortimer durand for j a character we cannot recommend the book to novelreaders pur sang they will find it tedious in spite of some charmingand some rather realisticharem scenes the landscape and the historic durbars and the military surroundings are well done yet all the time we feel ourselves not in persia of the eighteenth century but rather in the persia of nasiruddin shah and that is not the feeling the author designed,unmarked_contra
peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff

university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,unmarked_contra

nisbet perhaps genius does not wholly consist in an infinite capacity for taking pains there is no genius without that capacity and most of all is it consummated in its effect of having taken no pains at all the greatest genius is that which seems to proceed from the soul of its creator as naturally and spontaneously as the song of a bird the strongest man is he who does with simple ease what the weaker man must struggle after with all his might and with every artificial aid he can bring to his assistance and too often it is the struggle rather than the achievement that both the admirer and

of being banal or even obviousas a novice lost among the littlenesses of a short story is bound to be over and over againthat he would rather be derivative and preferably meredithian nevertheless it should be understood that judged by any standards less exacting than those that our author sets himself these stories would be judged as quite excellent and as literature far above most short stories their faults and affectations are after all merely the faults and affectations of the unannealed soul that takes itself too seriously whilst their merits are born of that flame of pale ardour and

the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity  the works of george meredith memorial edition vols ivl constable  co this memorial edition of merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use for the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciation  the works of george meredith 17 vols 6s each constable to fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  standard edition  of merediths works except the price the paper is good the type clear and of a comfortable size and the books tastefully bound in blue cloth with gilt tops eight of the volumes have been issued the two latest being  harry richmond  and  beauchamps career the poetical works are issued in uniform style for an extra halfcrown so that in eighteen volumes at a total cpst of about five pounds one rtay now possess the whole of merediths writings his greatness as novelist and poet are no longer in question his place in our literature is secure certain of his admirers have injured his popularity by exaggerating the difficulties of his style but that talk is dying down arid the new generation of readers is suspecting that it reflected rather on the limitationl oqf those admirers than on the art

the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby os max goschen an unmistakable originality is evident in every one of the fourteen stories and sketches which comprise the adventuress the author seems to have studied maupassant but followed him at a safe distance for if the method is similar the manner is his own mr willoughby loves his london and places in it the familiar types generally with a suggestion of the bizarre but without straining for effect and always with delicacy he has the true dramatic instinct even the longest speeches of his characters have a cumulatively stimulating effect  the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby goschen 2s net of these fourteen  stories three are distinctly striking by reason of a certain passionate crudity a realism that gives actual discomfort when we think that it may mean reality these three are  lily may  life wins and  a sea captain  quick cruel sensational sketches that evolve thoughts of pastel work  dark clouded backgrounds now lit up by the lurid gleams of the lowest life now suffused with a changing glow of luxury we would add the  watch night service did it not recall overforcibly mr wellss  love and mr lewisham  a london dawn  and the  psychology of fires  are more in the nature of tours de force  vivid in their way but unreal showing too much composition in the pastel this defect is still more marked in the descriptions of the isle of dogs and rosherville and it reaches a climax in the 4 correspondence mr willoughby are we right in the sex  delights in his technique which is nearly if not always equalled by his observation  but it is our impression that both will run to seed if devoted overmuch to sketches of this nature  in a larger theme these qualities would be kept within bounds and so be more effective he might try a wider and more complex field  the adventuress for example though its abrupt ending evidently so designed is not devoid of cleverness might be developed into a good novel,unmarked_contra
the sineater and other tales by fiona macleod edinburgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss macleod is the first writer who has tried nativdy to interpret the gael not of the scottish highlands but of the islands te southern readers and for sheer originality other qualities apart her tales in this volume are as remarkable perhaps as anything we have had of the kind since mr kipling appeared they are so original  in fact they treat of so strange a subjectmatter and in so strange a way that the unregenerate saxon may find them at first a little difficult on a further acquaintance he will find that their local colour their idiom their whole method combine to produoe an effect whioh may be unaccustomed but is therefore the more irresistible 44 why asks miss madeod in her dedicatory epistle to mr george meredith why do i write these things  it is because i wish to say to you and to all who may read this book that in what i have said lies the secret of the gad the beauty of the world the pathos of life the gloom the spiritual glamour it is out of these the heritanoe of tiie gad that i have wrought these tales this dearly commits the writer to the romantic method that we find preserved in all these tales though they have here and there a touch of that realism which romance has never been entirely withoutceltic romance especially the first of them the sineater is a capital example in its romantic kind you feel in reading it that the talewriter has not gone to her subjectmatter as a purely disinterested agent on the contrary she brings her passionate predilections instead of being disinterested she is perfervidly interested she goes prepared to find the things that count oeltically speaking and she finds themthe gloom the spiritual glamour and the rest tomorrow some new realist will go over the same ground and bring back his very different report of things as they really are and tell us what queer kind of porridge he saw the achannas eat but miss madeod being to the manner born writes from the inside and not from the outride is affected through her imagination and not through her nerves and is sometimes so carried away by her subject that she forgets how suburban the modern reader is apt to be and how he likes his sealions caged and labelled and his peatsmoke described in terms of fleetstreet not only does she forget this she deliberately does all she can to inorease the sea terror the wildness and the gaelic savour of her tales the sineater begins with the wet wind and the sea mist of the western ides and ends with the wild cry of the man neil ross as he goes down in the  black eddy  that rushes between skerrymohr and skerrybeag an eirig rn anama  in ransom for my soul all through it one hears the seanoises and feels the seawind and the sineater is treated in bold accord with such elemental circumstance half man half myth he is the scapegoat of the sea he bears the sins of others but with no scapegoats innocence therein lies the motive which is treated in this tale with so much force at last he makes his seaexit on a spar that is like the cross nay in the words of aulay maoneill who tells his end  it was the cross he was on i saw that thing with the fear upon me ah poor drifting wreck that he was judas on the cross it was his eric still more strange and from an english point of view more simply and artistically constructed and written is  the dannanron perhaps the finest thing in the book   you know what is said in the ides about    about this or that man who is under jheasan  who is spellbound    and    about the seals and    says marcus aohanna to anne the heroine of this strange tale   they say that seals he repeated slowly they say that seals are men under magic spells here we have suggested a fine dramatic motive at the threshold of an old gaelic folktale and miss madeod uses her opportunity with singular control of the magic machinery of an uncanny subject the figure of gloom aohanna who plays the tune of the dannanron on his feadan an oatenpipe or flute is one not easily forgotten he lives with unreal reality in ones mind his wild tunes hold ones ear though they are described with characteristic celtic exaggeration by indirection by colour instead of musio as eg  again gloom took up the feadan and sent a few cold white notes floating through the hot room breaking suddenly into the wild fantastic opening air of the dannanron a few pages further and we come upon manuss song which with the description that follows may be given as an instance of miss macleods writing of both verse and prose  the tide was dark an heavy with the burden that it bore i heard it tal kin whisperinupon the weedy shore each wave that stirred the seaweed was like a closing door tis dosing doors they hear at last who

of pde gold or a seanettle swam to the surface and turned its blue or greenish globe of living jelly to the moon dazzle there is some excess of mere colour it maj be thought in all this but that too is very celtic and so throughout these tales the manner of their telling their idiom their very mannerisms only tend to increase their total effect to quote again from their tellers singular opening epistle from iona addressed to him whom she calls  prince of celtdom  they have been written  as by one who repeats with curious insistence a haunting familiar yet ever wild and remote air whose obscure meanings he would fain reiterate interpret it is only by insisting as she does with some romantic excess on the vivid traits and idioms of the remote gaelic folk she describes that she brings home to us their speech sentiment and spirit of life as the true interpreter may she expressly disavows the documentary method at the start she is subjective and interpretative to a degree she is often so much moved by her own subject matter that heines famous confession of overmuch sentiment iu his buch le grand is apt to recur as one reads her tales then are not documentary they reveal their writers individuality quite as much as the idiosyncrasy of the island gael but just for this very reason they provide as original an entertainment as we are likely to find in this lingering century

new novels pig8 in clover by frank danby heine mann frank danby falls between two stools the opening chapters of  pigs in clover give promise of an interesting study of english life on normal levels but we are disappointed on the entrance of karl althaus the south african millionaire several characters including a woman whose luckless blood is scientifically inherited from a demirep have a life and reality of their own but alas this does not carry us beyond the first sixty pages with karl althaus the novel takes a turn for the worse and becomes quite another thing with long lanes that seemingly have no ending and a mesh of characters and interests that are disproportionate and out of perspective there is for example mrs de groot who is described as the author of the kaffir and his master and who is also represented as making common cause with the prime minister of cape colony against the boers althaus is one of the hebrew millionaires who threw in their lot with the late cecil rhodes the advisability the taste and even the practicability of introducing contemporary people into modern fiction are open to doubt but we should say that there could be no question as to the verdict on the course frank danby has seen fit to adopt if through her delay says the prime minister of cape colony when the jameson raid is reported to him her damnable calm and red tape there is a hair of one of those mens heads injured ill pull the place down upon her i ii make hell through the length and breadth of the by continent this is the style in which he is made to talk to althaus and

should not have dwelled upon the unsatisfactory nature of this novel had we not seen in it the germs of something really good as it is frank danby seems to us to have simply wasted her material  pigs in clover by frank danby heinemann 6s there are two ways of pessimism in art one tnices the cruelty of circumstance the other of humanity from this passionate novel which we have seen miscalled  smart we cull a sentence that shows frank danbys way of pessimism  the bright elusive womanhood which had bewitched karl louis saw shy and wild and he wanted it as men always want to bring down wild things it is then a woman whom we see piloted into tragedy in reading these pages and in fact they reveal two women whom charon could hardly have conducted to shores gloomier than those they reached one is a politicians neglected daughter whose quixotic generosity entraps her into a foul marriage whence she emerges a creature who  always did what she was told the other is an author famous for a novel of south africa and she is the bright elusive lady in our quotation the man whom she thought might inspire a chapter wheedles her into adultery snubs her pen into silence finally lays his mean and faithless spirit bare before her yet never calls to the loving animal in her nature without shaking her with a frenzy of obedience for he is essentially belami a creature with genius in his flesh like the debauched journalist who prowls through de maupassants immortal pigstye there is no escape from his evil allurements save by death or flight imagine these women moving in the highest circles about the time of the jameson raid imagine finance in hundreds of thousands and controlling them a great softhearted jew who bawls that wrhen the jew is honoured as a jew he will shout in his synagogue  i believe in christ thank the great god i can say it now there is indeed plenty of bustle and chatter and actuality to persuade us that joan and aline are women of an unremote yesterday the vulgar references to gladstone are to ba regretted and it must be confessed that the identification of fictitious persons with public events is managed rather unadroitly one suspects a roman  def but there is neither losk nor key the strength and intensity of the novel however are beyond dispute  pigs in clover by frank danby 6s heinemann the two persons in  pigs in clover with whom one always remains in complete sympathy are the rugged greathearted millionaire karl althaus and the sad sweet little englishwoman joan separated from the dutch husband she does not love the soulless effeminate nearly allconquering louis althaus karls adopted brother is one of the most graceless and contemptible scoundrels that ever stained the pages of a novel he is drawn vividly and with a merciless insightso too is the unhappy aline hayward though towards the close when she is louis wife and when karl who has loved joan from the first persuades her to marry him having learned how she has been betrayed and deserted by the brother he now disowns it is difficult to believe that even aline could be so innocently impervious to friendly warnings while louis and joan renew their old acquaintance in karls absence and that when she finds joan weeping in louis arms she did not grasp the full significance of the situation unless we accept her as a wholly irresponsible imbecile alines earlier schoolgirl romance and its culmination in marriage smith the drunken jockey jack forrest are admirably well done and the hiding of that scandal and the farreaching consequences of it all help in the shaping of a well imagined and ingeniously constructed plot frank danbvs references to the late mr gladstones home rule policy are as gratuitously insolent as her shrieking admiration of the jameson raiders is hysterical but away from such debatable ground in south africa before the war in london financial circles in various phases of political and social life the story is convincingly realistic and is written with a skill and dramatic picturesqueness that should ensure its popularity  pigs in clovek by frank danby a long story of modern political and social life the father of the heroine was a rising politician whose career is described with frequent reference to recent political events aline makes a tragic marriage in the third chapter and then we are in the whirlpool there are jews

author of charles auchester smith elder and co 65 cornhill the plot of this novel is somewhat flimsy in structure and is rather devoid of interest nor is it interspersed with powerfully delineated

nor paled hor ups wore fixed her luminous eyes watched his as the moon looks down at us from its heaven  no tendril of uer hair trembled she gave no smile but beneath saronas finger her pulse grew restless and unequal t never strong it now quivered as the strong vibration of a smitten harpstring it throbbed to pain and then its throb became a thrill she no longer felt her heart beat the pulsation seemed to have gone down into her wrist and up into hor dazzled brain she knew exactly how long to bear it and that she could not bear it long she suddenly drew back her hand very quietly and softly and said in a hushed voice 44 that is quite enough i think i am to be of no moro use than the rest sarona gave a sharp start as from a celestial incubus roseturned quickly and was about to speak then as sharply he turned back upon bose and stared 44 just look at bernard everybody was looking even lord federne who had taken a fresh observation was transfixed in the opening of the door mossmoor in boywonder kept smiling up at salome she could not smile she was too absorbed for bernard outstretched upon the sofa had sunk lower and lower until he lay as if in bed one arm was thrown over his forehead and the rosy palm of that hand lay open like a shell the fingers were relaxed as an infants his face was suffused with the blush of slumber the warm blood so seldom gathered to the cheek except in childhood tinted far more than usual his somewhat eallid lips its frequent frown had melted from the foreead the mouth was just open enough to show the glimmer of the teeth above all most strange to say the eyes were closedclosed with no flutter ot the lidsno quiver of the eyelash from the feet crossed carelessly to the calm of the soft dark hair all wai at rest with bernard miss dudleigh had never moved since she first assumed her seat she stiu looked at him but not so rigidly and now in place of her stonelike paleness her cheeks were slightly flushed she felt sarona behind her for he advanced on tiptoe and without moving her head she whispered 44 is it not strange  i cannot understand it myself 44 it is most wonderful and yet does not surprise me you succeeded better than i did 44 oh that is only because i did not try to do so much i only wanted to make him sleep and i know i could i resolved i thought of nothing else 44 and yet you could do more i am persuaded

not do bim any harm as it would if he became comatose and then moss fetched his father and federne brought mrs delapole nothing could convince this lady that it was any hut an everymght sleep sarona did not try to convince her neither did anybody else and yet through all the talking and laughing that followed bernard did not wake he slept for quite an hour in that entranced position never moving his lips nor closing his open hand not till sarona declared he must bo gone did cecilia set herself to wake him and strange to say it was not so easy she looked at him a long time before he even stirred and then t was impatiently pettishly  he rubbed his fingers into his eyes and opened them  staredrubbed them again  frowned darkly the spanish gloom passing as a cloud upon the rose of

tor bernard hourly augmenting he too is struck by the beauty of cecilias music thb powxk ot music it may be supposedand is we believe by the musically uninitiated who fancy they have fathomed its remotest significancethat all music is exciting it is not so to the musical music is the only calmthe only restthe one idea of heaven which is the essence of things longed for the soul expanded overpowered with though presence of jehovah as he revealed himself in that ancient shrine where his shadow was lightthe tranced folds of sacred raiment about the sacerdotal feetwere not more still of more serenity in their repose than the musician fully gifted with the conception and the revelation of tone his only worship there is excitement until the highest ecstasy is attained the element of that enthusiasm which lifts the soul on wings to god but never afterwards but for music to be exciting it must bear relation to our humanitymust simulate our pains and pleasuresmust humour us by reminiscence yea even from the loftiest type of regular dramatic illustration to its lowest form a rhythmical association of sound with motion there is in fact no music so physically and merely exciting as music written for the dance but it does not follow that all dancesymphonies excite all persons bernards temperamentthe susceptible alt music for the dance excited saronasthe impressible seldom any but for once he was to be touched tonight standing by federne and resolving as a duty to aleud and listen outwardsneither to take notice nor to hear the beatings of his heart within himhe first became aware that he had never heard a measure so strange before his memory was first aroused as cecuias had been in writing by the dream in the deeps of ages gone and passed awaywhich bernards words in their youngest poetry had evolved as by another musicthe dreams of forms forgotten when giants were upon our islandearth and left thrir footsteps on our sandsthe dream ot midnight with white pillars meteorwreathed and no templeroof but the starry vaultthe dream of that awful march whose tramp shook garlands darkly scatteredthe streaming stores like snowreefsthe hands that moved upon dread harps like virginflame the pompous stirtie unknown ritethe secret words and then as lt had been with cecuia thc mythic marvel passed and another mood succeeded she had poured her whole passion into those notes the fabulous phantasm but beguiled as a veiling mist upon the mountain the chords broke pitilessly upon the heart when the brain had received its impression the pulses answered it was like the repinings of lost lovethe daint of wandering fancy sarona was obliged to go on istenmg having once given way impatiently ho longed for the strain to close it seemed remorselessly to extend it held him fast in its undulating spellit mocked with sweetness that soothed him not but that he felt through though toils of the harmony as she had felt it while she wove the sounds m solitude and it affected others too for bernard it was the witchcraft of a will far wider than his own its grave yet bounteous measure made him at once understand what he had felt and feel it more utterly and as in feeling most and meaning to express it he was most unlike sarona under strong exoitement so in this expressiob he became more like him in his medium moments bernard calls on sarona to announce his intended marriage with miss de berri and seeks to persuade herz to offer his hand to cecilia dudleigh after bernards marriage dr saronas parents come to stay with him and frequent and long are the conversations on temperaments between cecilia and the father of herz miss dudleigh goes to rockedge to stay with the bernards the semblance of pride and contempt which had hitherto lain between her and ralph is dispelled and they converse as friends one lovely summers evening they go out in a small boat on the seaalone too late he drew his oars in laid them down glistening like gathered reeds and stepped across the seat it was the only one between them and he sat down on it slowly close before her she drew the mantle from his hands and flung it round her  one end splashed down into the sea and she turned to reach it but bernard caught it first and wrapped it carefully and closely to her breast leaning towards her looking at her with his most serious expression  a gravity terrible upon such a face so long he looked he leaned that she raised her eyes and fixed them full upon him those glorious lights so calm if passionate and perfectly serene had scarcely touched his vision before his own eyes fell he looked asleep and surely must have slumbered for in another instant he had clasped her fingers in a clench which itself told agony beyond all words and pressed them to his lips she felt not summer breath nor blossom kisses but a tear that fell upon her cold hand cold as death then softly warily she folded both her arms  ok fear notdo not be afraid he whispered441 will ask nothing tell you nothing but i will say thisfor my own saxe not yours for of course you cannot suffer i always loved youwould have married youi mean have asked youbut for saronas sake she stretched her white hand with a grace as calm as her unalterable aspect and laid it on his tips one moment he was silent but the next on that strange face of bis there gleamed a spectral smile 4 but you love me again he said this time not whispered  4t i do not ask you to say yes but if you say not 4 no i shall believe it there was no reply and bernard took up the oars he seemed between each soft and soundless dip each silver splash to listen for her voice in fear the soft and sound less dip though silver splash were all the moonlight rocks drew nearer  they were past the cliff shone close and bridit the haven was at hand from the silence between that two companions it might have seemed as though thehaven were the dearest longed for as if uncongenial and unloving they dreaded not but rejoiced to part perhaps it was so for bernard as they approached the mcflringi darted from the boat as if to escape the sea then and for ever i the cholera rages in h sarona fews for roses life

black magic  pfr amica silentia lunve   is a book for the yeats enthusiast that is to say we should not recommend it to any one who has anything else of mr yeatss still to read a man who knows only  innisfree and  the heavens embroidered clothes  may be left happily with the rest of the poems with the  stories of red hanrahan and should he wish to know something of the poets life with the exquisite  reveries over childhood and youth in  per amica silentia luna mr yeats is less often exquisite than affected it is not his genius that he reveals to us here but some curious crannies of his mind of course mr yeatss mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind and well worth exploring  but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about there are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle here for instance are two consecutive sentences  one night i heard a voice that said   the love of god for every human soul is infinite for every human soul is unique  no other can satisfy the same need in god our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death but only that we should seek it in those who are dead even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom they need mr george robeys interpreting  in other words to simplify them they are the means however by which mr yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts there was no need for mr yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of per amica silentia luna by w b yeats macmillan  co 45 dd net words we are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it mr yeats says   i have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of indian and japanese poets old women in connaught mediums in soho because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world we wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says   faith is the one gift that man can make to god it is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following   all souls have a vehicle or body and when one has said that with more and the platonists one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some church or institution and found oneself with great poetry and superstition which is but popular poetry in a pleasant dangerous world mr yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions he is saying what he means however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose he believes that every great man has a demon to mingle with his life it is a daemon literally and not figuratively speaking who inspires every man of genius the demon who is the creator of the work of art mr yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement and divides them from one another under the names of self and antiself self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses antiself is the daemon maker of a thing far greater than the man himself it is in his attempted explanation of his belief that mr yeats like other theologians breaks down he bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal he experiences what one would describe if one were speaking of oneself as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself mr yeats describes his sensation thus  when i come home after meeting men who are strange to me and sometimes even after talking to women i go over all i have said in gloom and disappointment perhaps i have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle from hostility that is but fear or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy my fellow  diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity and how should i keep my head among images of good and evil crude allegories r how indeed  did not charles lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellowguest had the misfortune to ask if milton was a great poet   but when i shut my door and light my candle i invite a marmorean muse an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different for now there must be no reaction action only and the world must move my heart but to the hearts discovery of itselfall my thoughts have ease and joy i am all virtue and confidence it is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that mr yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work he will not accept the commonplace idea that this  heroic condition  is his true self he regards it rather as  the lord of terrible aspect  who appeared to dante and said  egodominus tuus  the descent of the demon who when the moment of creation comes makes for mr yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius  when i consider the minds of my friends says mr yeats  among artists and emotional writers i discover a like contrast and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work there is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse but with women or liquor in their lives  and mr yeats refers to dantes lechery and shakespeares  pottle pot  with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate but this division into self and antiself is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind it is impossible to divide personality with a butchers cleaver one may get interesting generalisation as the result but one will not get truth if mr yeatss theory were correct psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose the elements of a mans nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air and the air with the veining branches of the tree,unmarked_contra

ordinary families by e amnot robertson cape 7s 6d the flowering thorn by mar gery sharp arthur barker 7s 6d salah and his american by leland hall cresset press 7s 6d miss e arnot robertsons fourth novel has been chosen by the book society for august which means i suppose that mr walpole has already used all the best superlatives about it and that by the time this review appears in print those same superlatives will have been lavishly spilled all over the advertisement columns of the sunday papers let me start then with my only complaint ordinary families lacks pattern it is a tranchie de vie somewhat arbitrarily hewn with characters wandering in and out of it at will and only a slender unifying idea which is apt to be lost to sight in a maze of side issues it is perhaps less a fine novel than a book by a fine novelist and the book society has done well to encourage a young writer who is undoubtedly going to give us even better books than this the idea behind a not very good title is that  no family however ordinary on the outside is ordinary when one comes to know it intimately  actually it is difficult to imagine that the three families with which we chiefly have to dorush cottrell and questwould be strictly ordinary to the most detached view rush pare sailor boatbuilder and exadventurer would be heartily welcome in place of many an  ordinary  father and quest pare is one of those delightful eccentrics whom one meets with luck once or twice in a lifetime to the greater reading public it is not ordinary to manoeuvre sailingcraft with the mastery to which the whole quest family seems to have been born and it is certainly very far from ordinary to write about sailing as miss robertson does while if birdwatching were an ordinary pursuit lallie rush would have been elbowed out of those enchanting hours enchantingly described on the east coast dunes but it is at all events the common lot of mankind to grow up and the story takes us boldly through the adolescence of lalage and the parallel development of her brothers and sisters and friends what an ordinary what a tempting and what an alarmingly difficult theme i only the most unflinching sincerity could carry it through and miss robertson has that she has also fearless logic penetrating irony and infallible observation all at hand to guide the spontaneous emotion which informs every page of her writing if her book lacks pattern it also lacks purpose which is a thing for which to thank heaven fasting i mean that she is concerned to prove no thesis and point no very clear moral though the wit of her characterization forms itself at times into missiles for aunt sallies that richly merit them miss margery sharp is another clever woman writer and it is no criticism of the flowering thorn to say that beside ordinary families it wears an air of superficiality it is a brightly written and well constructed tale of the postwaugh school though the characters hover rather nearer to life than do the delicious grotesques of mr evelyn waugh lesley frewen acting on a whim adopts an orphan boy and forsakes her familiar cocktail environment to look after him in a country cottage thus the thorn flowers lesley is as it were regenerated and we leave her awaiting the coming of andrew bentall a nice worthwhile young man the plot may sound silly but the book is not it is quite consistently amusing and enjoyable salah and his american is one of those unusual books which the wide cloak of modem fiction takes in at its fringes it is a document of uncommon interest in a year which has seen the celebration of the wilberforce centenary for it gives a credible and fascinating picture of a negro to whom the word  slave  connotes nothing of shame or injustice the tragedy arises when his american protector a traveller in morocco has to answer his request to be given what the white man calls an  opportunity  the liberty of the modem industrial theorist is an uncomfortable gift this book has no sexinterest but it is very nicely illustrated francis watson,unmarked_contra

the manxman mr hall caines new novel like the greater part of his work indeed has one special and noticeable quality it forces you to feel how straight out of his heart he writes a few other writers

excellent workmanship the manxman is a very full book fuller even than the deemster and  the bondman appealing to varied interests expending a lavish amount of material and showing no thinness or flimsiness anywhere still its special power over readers is emotional a power great and dangerous his keen appreciation of humour may generally be trusted to keep this other and stronger quality

out of the story with a halo but what of philips heritage of weakness that had already driven him to intemperance and in katherine there was no nobility hers is a poor nature capable of better moments sufring curbs passion and often refines human nature but it cannot essentially change it and readers interested in these two cannot leave them with the thought they have found peace they had both suffered enough to have paid the price of death for one at least philips story and petes character are the outstanding features of the book pete is a real creation humorous unconsciously poetical and

fiction abbots ferney by u macaulay murray 6s r macaulay has written an interesting book her work is sound and careful and illumined by occasional flashes of insight its chief defect is an inclination to diffuseness and her characters at times become dim and even lost in the fog of detail and explanation  its chief quality is absolute sincerity the story is simple and reasonable relying for interest as such a story should upon the play of circumstance on character the three generations of ruths are realised and expressed with admirable distinctness the misery of verney ruth when he becomes involved in the disgrace of his father and is disinherited by his grandfather is finely described and his pride his sensitive reserve his pluck are brought out with great skill though wear unable to sympathise as we seem expected to with his resentment against rosamond for not giving him all when by her strength and kindness she had already given him much we read the book with the interest that real sincerity almost always commands the authors prose is usually good  occasionally it is distressingly harsh as when she writes of  phlegmatic practicality but happily such phrases are rare and we recommend the book without hesitation,unmarked_contra

tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a nobleman thus addresses i

which to usc a vulgar but expressive phrase was i complete hectic squasher these we suppose are among the peculiarities which have contributed to give wings to the fame of these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling their too obviously imperfect and defective education  talee of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beau clerk and henrietta maary beauclerk smith elder  co there is much that is silly some things which are absurd with a good deal that is clever in this volume we have seldom seen a work of more unequal merit there is a mixture of poetry and prose in the contents the prose is the best the poetry is poor in the extreme the merit of the work chiefly consists in the insight it gives into the foibles arid follies of the fashionable world the volume professes to be only the first of a series we doubt

cannot quite share the enthusiasm of some of our contemporaries so as to term this novel  preeminent and peerless it is a very clever novel but it is not what the lexaminer calls it mrs norton possesses a great deal of descriptive power and much pathos her writings are always pleasant to read  she appeals strongly to our sympathies and her composition is remarkable for a certain glow of eloquence felt though it cannot be described but she is not peerless on the contrary she has many superiors she is defective in the two most important features of the great novelistshe cannot create characters nor can she construct an ingenious plot unlike most writers of fiction mrs norton has given us in stuart of dunleath a very uninteresting hero and in eleanoit a very interesting heroine the

to rejoice in the happiness of the living we will not give an inkling of the story of this novel for we remember how often our own pleasure in the perusal has been marred by the imperfect revelations

  a lady of quality i by frances hodgson a burnett warne  co it is certain that no more striking proof has yet been given of mrs hodgson burnetts versatility than in her latest work and versatility if the most prominent is not the only feature that strikes us in a lady of quality mistress clorinda is a dramatic figure after the style of mr george meredith whether it be the baby arousing sir jeoffrys paternal interest by the use of his own huntingcrop and the language of his own stable as applied to himself or the beautiful girl riding to hounds in breeches with her fathers boon companions or again for her own ends adopting brocaded petticoats a dignified demeanour and a duenna but still the terror of her householdtho reader will follow with fascinated interest the fortunes of clorinda wildairs it is idle to reflect whether such a woman could have had her being even in the eighteenth century her later history raises a moral question of which space denies us the full discussion that a woman may break two important commandments and yet live successively as the honoured wife of an earl and a duke and ultimately die in the odour of sanctity as the purest and noblest lady god eer loved seems to our thinking unfair  not i said she as a girl  there thou mayest trust me i would not be found out and she kept her word with conscientious success it would seem that her great love for the duke worked in her a great redemption certainly the duchess of osmonde led not merely a blameless so much might be said for the countess of dunstanwolde but an admirable life and mrs burnett is obviously as convinced of her heroines virtues as the duke himself even the pious anne an excellent foil throughout to her tempestuous sister absolves her from the need of confession to her husband it might be urged in her defence that such a woman is a law unto herself or again that the necessity as clorinda judged it for the second crime was sufficient punishment for the first for ourselves we are oldfashioned enough to consider the moral doubtful be that as it may clorinda whether as maid countess or duchess is a strong not to say daring figure marred by an occasional lapse into cheap sensationa fault to be deplored in mrs burnetts workbut as a whole unquestionably striking it is greatly to the credit of the story that it holds in itself sufficient life and movement to carry us over the tedious reproduction of eighteenth century language upon which as well as upon the setting generally the author has bestowed an infinity of pains,unmarked_contra

the sign of that prophet by james ball naylor treherne  co such a novel as  the sign of the prophet stands but a poor chance of success with english readers it belongs to that large class of semihistorical romances much in rogue in america for reasons not very easy for us to appreciate the story opens in 1811 nnd it is described as a tale of tecumseh and tippecanoe there is in it a good deal of fighting of indians and britishers and a tedious amount of the usual humour which seems to have been in 1811 much the same both in quality and expression as it is at the present moment american novelists must be sadly hampered by the necessitywhich one supposes must be pressingof introducing so large a quantity of comic relief to avoid it altogether would be almost originality but perhaps it would be unsafe though it would be welcome to many readers  the sion of the prophet by jambs ball naylor  it was a hot sultry morning in the latter part of august 1811 so begins this tale of indian warfare iiii which a vast amount of blood is shed before victory blesses the american arms and the wiles of the prophet tenskwatawa are baffled treherne 6s,unmarked_contra

the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the author succeeded in the delineation  the queens manes a romauce of holyrood by g j whyte mielvle two tols parker so  bourn of historical character on the contrary the representatiobs which appear on

pretentious doggerel which mvr aytoun published some years ago under the name of a poem the borderer is delineated as from the first the unselfish lover of his queen  anl the brutality and cowardice which he displayed when he hat won the object of this pure devotion are glossed over in grandiloquent and meaningless sentences such as these 1the nman who would once have shed his hearts blood freely to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen

almost too ghastly wealth of detail and the deaths of the unhappy pair are infinitely dramatic though the interest is concentrated in the hapless father and son many of the minor characters like the patient conspirator gemma and her selfeffacing lover martini are sketched with pains  reviews the gadfly by e l voynich w heinemann i this is a remarkable story by an american writer which readers who prefer flesh and blood and human emotions to sawdust and adventure should consider as something of a godsend in order to give an idea of the book the outline of the plot must be told arthur burton an orphan a sensitive affectionate emotional enthusiastic youth of eighteenrevolutionary and pietist in one is arrested on a true charge of conspiring against the italian government and is thrown into prison he admits nothing denies all knowledge of his companions and completely baffles the authorities on gaining his release he discovers that the information for his arrest was communicated by the priest to whom he had confessed his jealousy of a fellow conspirator almost immediately afterwards gemma arthurs ideal of womanhood believing him to be a traitor to the cause to which she also belongs strikes him across the face and repulses him for ever and his guardians wife in a fit of rage at the discredit she considers him to have brought upon the family lets out the secret that he is the son of an illicit union between his mother and canon montanelli a good man and arthurs dearest friend these three blows coming one upon the other with such suddenness are too much arthurs faith in god and man crumbles away he seizes a hammer and smashes his crucifix spurns montanelli arranges a convincing story of his suiride by drowning and escapes for south america as a stowaway that is the prologue thirteen years pass and arthur returns as felice rivarez another monte cristo bent upon revengea cripple and a cynic gifted with great power of satire an avowed disbeliever in human fidelity aud truth and the implacable foe of priestcraft and religion under the soubriquet of the gadfly he is employed by the liberal party to carry on a pamphlet war against the jesuits gemma is a member of the committee from whom he receives his instructions montanelli who is now a cardinal is the opponent whose influence it is most important to break down the core of the story is the gadflys struggle between his true nature and his imposed nature between his love for his father montanelli and for gemma and his hostility to christianity it is unnecessary to follow his career as a conspirator let it suffice that in the end he is captured and sentenced to death cardinal montanelli alone stands between him and the grave a terrible scene takes place in the condemned mans cell resulting in the gadfly confession that he is the arthur of old the cardinals son 44 montanelli sat like some stone image or like a dead man set upright at first under the fiery torrent of the gadflys despair he had quivered a little with the automatic shrinking of the flesh as under the lash of a whip but now he was quito still after a long silence he looked up and spoke lifelessly patiently 4 arthur will you explain to me more clearly p you confuse and terrify me so i cant understand what is it you demand of me  the gadfly turned to him a spectral face 41 demand nothing who shall compd love p you are free to choose between us two the one who is most dear to you if you love him best choose him 41 cant understand montanelli repeated wearily 4 what is there i can choose p 1 cannot undo the past 4 you have to choose between us if you love me take that cross off your neck and come away with me my friends are arranging another attempt and with your help they could manage it easily then when we are safe over the frontier acknowledge me publicly but if you dont love me enough for thatif this wooden idol a crucifix is more to you than ithen go to the colonel and tell him you consent and if you go then go at once and spare me the misery of seeing you i have enough without that montanelli looked up trembling faintly he was beginning to understand 41 will communicate with your friends of oourse butto go with youit is impossible i am a priest 4 and i accept no favours from priests i will have no more compromises padre i have had enough of them and of their consequences you must give up your priesthood or you must give up me 4 how can i give you up p arthur how oan i give you up p 4 then give up him you have to choose between us would you offer me a share of your lovehalf for me half for your friend of a god p i will not take his leavings if you are his you are not mine 4 would you have me tear my heart in two  arthur arthur do you want to drive me mad p the gadfly struck his hand against the wall 4 you have to choose between us he repeated once more montanelli permits the law to take its course and the gadfly is shot this is the scene on the ground of execution  he had repeated the request that his eyes might not be bandaged and his defiant face had wrung from the colond a reluctant consent they had both forgotten what they were inflicting on the soldiers he stood and faced them smiling and the carbines shook in their hands 41 am quite ready he said the lieutenant stepped forward trembling a little with excitement he had never given the word of command for an execution before 4 readypresentfire  the gadfly staggered a little and recovered his balance one unsteady shot had grazed his oheek and a little blood fell on to the white cravat another ball had struck him above the knee when the smoke cleared away the soldiers looked and saw him smiling still and wiping the blood from his cheek with the mutilated hand 4 a bad shot men he said and his voice cut in clear and articulate upon the dazed stupor of the wretched soldiers  have another try a general groan and shudder passed through the row of carabineers eaoh man had aimed aside with a secret hope that the deathshot would come from his ndghbours hand not his and then the gadfly stood and smiled at them they had only turned the execution into a butchery and the whole ghastly business was to do again they were seized with sudden terror and lowering their carbines listened hopelessly to the furious curses and reproaches of the officers staring in dull horror at the man whom they had killed and who somehow was not dead the governor shook his fist in their faces savagely shouting to them to stand in position to present arms to make haste and get the thing over he had become as thoroughly demoralised as they were and dared not look at the terrible figure that stood and stood and would not fall when the gadfly spoke to him he stahed and shuddered at the sound of the mocking voice 4 you have brought out the awkward squad this morning colonel let me see if i can manage them better now men hold your tool higher there you to the left bless your heart man its a carbine youve got in your hand not a fryingpan are you all straight p now then  readypresent  4 fire  the colonel interrupted starting forward it was intolerable that this man should give the command for his own death there was another confused disorganised volley and the line broke up into a knot of shivering figures staring befor them with wild eyes one of the soldiers had not even dischargedhis carbine hehad flung it away and crouched down moaning under his breath 41 cant1 cant the smoke cleared dowly away floating up into the glimmer of the early sunlight and they saw that the gadfly had fallen and saw too that he was still not dead for the first moment soldiers and offioials stood as if they had been turned to stone and watched the ghastly thing that writhed and struggled on the ground then both doctor and colond rushed forward with a cry for he had dragged himself up on one knee and was still facing the soldiers and still laughing 4 another miss tryagain ladsseeif you cant he suddenly swayed and fell over rideways on the grass 4 is he dead p the oolonel asked under his breath and the doctor kneeling down with a hand on the bloody shirt answered softly 41 think so god be praised 4 god be praised  the colond repeated 4 at last  these quotations bear rather upon the dramatic value of the book than upon its psychology its psychology is as it happens not impressive mr voynich can conceive interesting characters but at present he lacks the power to embody them adequately his imaginative force is in advance of his execution the end of the book where action predominates is better than the earlier chapters where conversation has to bear the brunt of the work mr voynich has no gift of flashing insight he tells us much of the gadflys wit but we meet with little worthy the name the book needs to be more tensemore well more meredithian vittoria was ever before me as i read the fabric of the gadfly is so good that some day mr voynich might rewrite the story but as it stands it is more deeply interesting and rich in promise than ninetynine out of every hundred novels that pass through the reviewers hands,unmarked_contra

the wyvern mystery a novel new novels by j s le fanu 3 vols tinsley brothers much will not be said in behalf of  the wyvern mystery by those mild and commonplace people who think that a novel should aim rather at the exhilaration than the depression of the readers spirits that it should forbear to give pain which is not calculated to enhance the effect of its pleasurable representations that its illustrations of the evil should be put in contrast against equally vivid exhibitions of the good of human nature and that at the end it should leave the reader in the intellectual and moral condition of a man who has been listening to fiue music or contemplating a noble work of art or enjoying the stimulus of good company on the contrary by those many persons who delight in strong hysterical emotions and are of opinion that the romancewriter labours within the proper province of his art when he alternately freezes the readers heart and causes his hair to stand on end by pictures of eccentric vice and cruel violence a rush will be made to the libraries for the new tale of the novelist whose present performance surpasses all his previous wild stories in sensational inhumanity that the book overflows with cleverness and force no reader will deny but mr sheridan le fanu adds nothing to his reputation by another display of literary adroitness and melodramatic ability it must also be conceded that much labour has been expended on the first two volumes the separate parts of which are fitted together with the most precise and cunning workmanship and that the character of mildred tarnleythe faithful honest harsh old servingwoman who tells innumerable falsehoods in her masters service whilst she sharply censures his misconduct and sturdily declines to flatter himsecures the book from a charge of being altogether deficient in humour the naturalness of the other feminine characters is not conspicuous but the three principal men of the dramaold squire fairfield of wyvern and his two sonsare creatures of human flesh and blood surcharged with some of the most odious qualities of the race that they dishonour the harsh despotic scurrilous squire of wyvern a brute whose abusive tongue respects neither virtue nor the grave is not untrue to a period when englishmen of common stuff albeit of ancient pedigree used to think it a proof of manly spirit to bully their dependents and drink themselves at least once a day into stupefaction the disdainful abhorrence roused by the selfishness and moral imbecility of the squires elder son who by marrying alice maybell does her the greatest injury it is in his power to inflict upon her is evidence of the skill with which his despicable nature is portrayed and though harry fairfieldwho combines the smart  slanginess  of foker and the meanness of barnes newcome with the niggardliness of miser elwesis a more revolting specimen of the cheat sneak and cad than we have ever before encountered in prose fiction the picture of his loathsomeness does not surpass the bounds of possibility or even wander beyond the lines of experience the opening chapters of the narrative introduce the reader to alice maybell a fair and fortuneless beauty soon after her secret marriage with charles fairfield and to her patron the abusive old squire of wyvern who having in consideration of remote consanguinity extended patronage to her otherwise friendless infancy and girlhood is of opinion that the charming woman should reward his past kindness by consenting to be the wife of his failing years taking this view of her obligations the aged savage woos the frightened girl with a grotesque and boisterous amorousness that reminds us of squire westerns least delicate demeanour in the presence of ladies  and when alice escapes at the same time from his importunities and his house and flies with her bankrupt husband to a desolate and dilapidated old mansion not many miles distant from wyvern the furious dotard curses the pair with the choicest imprecations to be found in his comprehensive vocabulary of abuse and ere long he has grounds for flattering himself that his amiable wishes have not been ineffectual in carwell grange the miserable dwelling to which charles fairfield takes his bride even as a few years earlier he had brought the recentlydiscarded mistress who plays an important part in the drama alices life ia wretched and unseemly that he may not draw his impatient creditors upon him or reveal his lurkingplace to the emissaries of the woman who instead of consenting to her banishment from

impoverished brothers expense to smoke the spendthrifts cigars and to urge him to proceed yet further on the road to ruin at length however another visitor arrives at the grange in the person of a blind and unspeakably hideous dutch woman named bertha velderkaust who effects an entrance into the mansion during charlesfairfields absence and whilst alice is in bed of berthas peculiarities it is enough to say that in addition to blindness and the disfigurements of smallpox they comprise a strong appetite for opium and brandy a temper given to maniacal ebullitions of rage and a demoniacal hatred of the woman who has supplanted her in her former paramours affections having contrived to enter the house and terrorised mildred tarnley into giving her a supper and bed this pleasant inmate

intervention of timely aid alice escapes from her murderous assailant who is seized and consigned to the county prison where instead of exhibiting an anxiety for her own fate at the approaching assizes she vows vengeance on her former keeper whom she accuses of having committed bigamy but ere the wyvern  mystery can be unravelled by lawyers in a publio court the position of affairs is changed by the sudden death of charles wyvern shortly before alice gives birth to the boy with whose fortunes the remainder of the story principally concerns itself after charless death the interest of the tale sensibly diminishes and more than once in the course of the third volume the threads of the narrative seem to be falling from the weavers hand whilst he appears to be in doubt how to work them into an appropriate ending acting in harmony with his previous conduct harry fairfield gets possession of his brothers son puts him out of sight and makes alice believe that the little fellow is

alone in west africa by mary gaunt werner laurie the avidity with which travel books are sought after by the public is apt to thrust into the market a type of descriptive work which wilfully trades upon the readers curiosity the principle of  omne ignotum pro magnifico focuses attention on the unknown country rather than the qualities that go to the visualising of it and tends to submerge critical acumen to avoid careful study becomes an acute temptation for this reason and on account of the multiple and disconnected impressions left by a book of this nature personality is invaluable in supplying unity and distinction and fixing a rallyingpoint for the reader mrs gaunts new book fulfils this demand it is not so much that her personality is virile and commanding as that it is sufficient to cut a way for the reader through the jungle of her journeys her salient capacity is a surprising and quickening commonsense she refuses to take things on trust alert enough to test all she hears and sees by her own experience our sole objection to her lucid and conscientious narrative is that she tends to lapse into impressionistic journalism the purely descriptive portions of her adventurous jaunt through littleknown districts in west africa do not call for detailed treatment mrs gaunt started up the gambia from bathurst through the  groundnut colony a land of promise so far as productivity is concerned she skirted sierra leone the white mans grave  staying a short time at its dirty illkempt capital freetown and spent some interesting days in liberia autonomous since 1822 through the courageous experiment of america for the semicultured native she has scant praise insisting on his boorishness his arrogance his raw and blatant egoism passing through the guinea coast almost fabulous in its natural beauties she reached half assinie and the french border from elmina the old portuguese mining settlement her pilgrimage took her to accra the capital of the gold coast colony up the volta to the krobo hills infamous for the mystic bloodorgies there practised by the nearly savage inhabitants over the eketo range and so to the border into the german colony of togo thence she travelled along the coast to the best point of vantage and turned inland into ashanti which has cost england so much money and so many lives and finally dipped down from kumasi its capital to the atlantic seaboard at sekondi where her route ended like another district which we deal with elsewhere much of this country had not been traversed before by a white woman mrs gaunts facile and rather gusty style never drifts into mere enumeration of peoples places and incidents her versatility is such that wherever she goes she kindles her narrative with patches and splashes of colour particularly illuminating are her hard penetrating comments on the prevailing fetishism concerning the west african climate the theory current as to its unredeemed vileness has she observes crystallised into superstition officials go there in confident expectation of having their energies enervated and paralysed by its humidity and in a spirit of calculated disgust they flout nature by burning the candle at both ends by falling into sedentary habits and a dumb mental resentment opposed to physical wellbeing so the consequent illhealth is as much the result of internal as extraneous causes it may be readily imagined how much the administration of the country suffers when activities but halfhearted and almost morose are applied to it mrs gaunts picture of the germans as colonisers of togo is in striking contrast to the verdict just given of their alertness regularity and cheerfulness she speaks in terms of ungrudging admiration their keen and trenchant methods of organisation she opposes to the british lack of plan and casual attitude without attempting to draw invidious comparisons she speaks of the presence of broad long roads the facilities for transit the instinct for governing the scientific warfare against sleeping sickness the insistence on cleanliness and order and the anxiety to preserve natural beauties where  england seems indifferent if the beautiful spot

have rescued the country from internecine strife strong measures have had the stimulating effect required concerning the vexed and seemingly inscrutable problem of the native population mrs gaunt is more reticent than we could wish her conclusions are enigmatic varying in accordance with the different status of the aborigines in different parts the halfemancipated native with his veneer of culture still she declares retains the rudiments of barbarism combined with the less agreeable characteristics of civilization his isolation from both white and black and his incapacity are complete for the primitive majority she veers towards the theory of a  benevolent despotism that depends for its validity on the temperament of the despot with whom unlimited authority is hardly favourable to the growth of sympathy and understanding and is apt to become inoculated with the virus of caesarism such are the scope and achievement of mrs gaunts bookone fertile in suggestion felicitous in style

tales of unrest reviews by joseph conrad t fisher unwin mb conrad has seen strange things in strange lands and he can describe what he has seen impersonally incuriously without sentimentality and without wailing he is not eloquent and hysteria is unknown to him but he has grit and the epithets  nervous artful buxom also describe his english these tales like his lastfine book the nigger of the narcissus march straight on where they are tragic the tragedy was inevitable the artist selects and tells that selection is his concern and his alone things horrid and inexplicable may happen and it is not his affair to suggest why heaven remains sealed and unanswering any more than it is his business to explain why illusions are often better aids to living than the naked truth he tells and the critics business is with the sincerity and method of presentment not with the choice of subject we rise from the reading of these tales of unrest strengthened not depressed for the work is sincere and it deals with realities mr conrad is a writers writer he is for those who joy in a good sentence a deft characterisation or the way the knots of an exposition are tied but these tales must not be taken with a hop skip and a jump those who want brisk dialogue and breathless action must go elsewhere you must assimilate his background if you would grasp the significance of the figures that dot his middle distance mr conrad is a painter in landscape who could have worked entirely in genre but he chose the other like the great landscape artists he brings equal facility to a sunset or to a man working in a field and the man is real part of the harmony not a lay figure dumped down as a sop to those who clamour for  human interest for example let us take a passage from the story called  the lagoon  nothing moved on the river but the eight paddles that rose flashing regularly dipped together with a single splash while the steersman swept right and left with a periodic and sudden flourish of his blade describing a glinting semicircle above his head the churnedup water frothed alongside with a confused murmur and the white mans canoe advancing upstream in the shortlived disturbance of its own making seemed to enter the portals of a land from which the very memory of motion had for ever departed    the men poled in the shading water the creek broadened opening out into a wide sweep of a stagnant lagoon the forests receded from the marshy bank leaving a level strip of bright green reedy grass to frame the reflected blueness of the sky a fleecy pink cloud drifted high above trailing the delicate colouring of its image under the floating leaves and the silvery blossoms of the lotus a little house perched on high piles appeared black in the distance   the steersman pointing with his paddle said  arsat is there i see his canoe fast between the piles  three of the stories treat of life in the eastern archipelago where green islets scattered through the calm of noonday lie upon the level of a polished sea like a handful of emeralds on a buckler of steel of these  karabi a memory  is the longest and the most ambitious it is the story of a noble and masterful malay and how he was cured by a young englishman of a terrible illusion on the principle that like things are cured by like the ruse is quite successful  he left us and seemed straightway to step into the glorious splendour of his stage to wrap himself in the illusion of unavoidable success here is a picture of a dutch trader it is karain who is speaking he traded and planted he despised our joys our thoughts and our sorrows his face was red his hair like flame and his eyes pale like a river mist he moved heavily and spoke with a deep voice he laughed aloud like a fool and knew no courtesy in his speech he was a big scornful man who looked into womens faces and put his hand on the shoulders of free men as though he had been a nobleborn chief the story called the idiots brings us nearer hometo france it is a terrible little tale about a peasant proud of himself proud of his wife proud of the bit of land he owned proud of the thought that sons will be born to him who will grow up by his side and carry on his name when he is laid away children are born to himbut one and all are idiots the end is tiie murder of the husband and the suicide of the wife that is how things happened in this unfortunate family and the world went on much the same strangers even became used to the idiot children shouting from the hedgerows  there are unfortunate people on the earth says the mother of the murderess and suicide i had only one child only one and they wont bury her in consecrated ground  it is very sad replies the marquis of chavanes  you have all my sympathy i shall speak to the curd    good day madame here is a final taste of mr conrads quality   that child like the other two never smiled never stretched its hands to her never spoke never had a glance of recognition for her in its big black eyes which could only stare fixedly at any glitter but failed hopelessly to follow the brilliance of a sunray slipping slowly along the floor when the men were at work she spent long days between her three idiot children and the childish grandfather who sat grim angular and immovable with his feet near the warm ashes of the fire the feeble old fellow seemed to suspect that there was something wrong with his grandsons only once moved either by affection or by the sense of proprieties he attempted to nurse the youngest he took the boy up from the floor dicked his tongue at him and essayed a shaky gallop of his bony knees then he looked closely with his misty eyes at the childs face and deposited him down gently on the floor again and he sat his lean shanks crossed nodding at the steam escaping from the cookingpot with a gaze senile and worried well observed is it not  one of the tales in this volume the return treats a modern subject such a subject as has obsessed mr marriot watson more than once to this study of a conjugal fatality mr conrad brings the same vivid observation the same restraint the same artful choice of words and the same sincerity of expression he has written some halfdozen volumes but it is by the nigger of the narcissus and these tales of unrest that he becomes a writer to be reckoned with his full achievement we believe is still in the making  tales of hearsayt in most of conrads stories the theme turns upon a point of honour the crews and even more the officers of sailingships have before their eyes and under their feet a tangible responsibility a responsibility that must be served both by physical and by moral courage not the most conical or feckless can make light of such a charge it has a final and compelling gravity mishandled or neglected a ship is liable to sink with all hands there is nothing funny about it no gleam of humour or alleviating circumstance such as attends the majority of human ills from slipping on a piece of orange peel to going bankrupt no outlet for the native buoyancy of the spirit that in the face of disaster wants to cry no matter and begin over again a shipwreck matters as much as anything  thomas alva edison by francis arthur jones sos 6d hodder  stoughton t  tales of hearsay by joseph conrad 7s 6d fisher unwin can whether ashore or afloat the characters in conrad regard life or life that is worth living as something that through their own fault may at any moment sink under them to their navigating eyes a scruple of conscience a nice point of behaviour is as concrete an obstacle as a rock if they strike it they are doomed they are not baffled to fight better they donot rise on steppingstones of their dead selves to higher things they have no comfortable philosophy in which to bury or justify their mistakes on the contrary they lose their selfrespect their confidence in their ability to behave properly and pine away like the outcast of the islands like the  capataz de cargadores in a kind of spiritual death they are heroic figures patterns of more than roman virtue and we watch with admiration and awe and such sympathy as the weakness of our nature entitles us to give their efforts to live up to their ideals we cannot dismiss their preoccupations as morbid the unrest of a will disabled by brooding they are capable of action though they shrink from it realising its irrelevance its essential onesidedness its antipathy to the perfection for which they strive but they do not therefore excuse themselves from action they know that it will commit them and misrepresent them and they are prepared to take the consequences it was in this spirit that razumov betrayed the refugee who sought his protection in this spirit that the mild humane verloc arranged for his wifes idiot brother to blow up the greenwich observatory and himself and in the present volume the sea captain who sends the fogbound neutral ship to meet destruction on the rocks has the same dilemma to face always humanity and reason are sacrificed to principle we are not told what happened to the sea captain but verloc was murdered and razumov punished by an outrage more horrible than almost anything in fiction it is characteristic of conrads point of view this intense antagonism between reason and action directly an action ceases to be spontaneous and instinctive it is poisoned at its source it becomes a separate malignant power with a life and will of its own and to meddle with it entails a radical change in ones condition like taking an anaesthetic or contracting a disease there is no connecting link no visible fuse even between the passages of contemplation and selfexamination in  victory for example and the welter of meaningless destruction in which it ends we are not to suppose that the  enchanted  heyst one of the most delightful of conrads characters by giving up his life to a parcel of rogues made late amends for the failure of his coal mine action in conrads view seems not a question of one mans life for anothers it is not so reasonable as that still less though it has the appeal of melodrama is it of melodramatic intention and least of all perhaps is it the normal and inevitable expression of passions that have become too strong to be restrained it is like an exhibition of the forces of nature an eruption or an earthquake how can a hundred nuances and qualifications of motive be summed up in a pistol shot or a blow  when in the first and best of the  tales of hearsay the tenderhearted russian lieutenant puts his old friend and benefactor out of his misery in accordance with his wish what is the result  the lieutenant resigns his commission and retires to his estates with a stain on his name this is a tvpically conradian issue to an honourable action an action undertaken in anguish to promote the dignity and decency of life in the last story which turns out unexpectedly so grim is the disguise under which its humour walks to be a joke the mountain of action once more labours and brings forth a legitimate offspring and not a monstrosity voluntarily the mate falls headfirst down the companionwas and by this ruse preserves the secret of his white hair a great risk one would think to achieve a small result but the result is achieved had conrad really been in earnest over this story one suspects that the mate would have been killed it is fruitless to read any author of the first rank without granting his postulates conrad assumes in all his tragic characters a tenacity of purpose a devotion to an idea an inelasticity an obstinacy almostthat are rarely met with one imagines in life a rogue in shakespeare when asked what he will do with himself now that he has been exposed boldly replies  simply the thing i am will make me live it is just that thing that makes conrads characters die or rather the absence of that vital unmoral principle they  cannot live after that the are fallen sometimes one is tempted to feel that many of conrads situa tions would be relieved or e v e n prevented if the characters w o u 1 d avail themselves of those outlets and escapes that life allows and indeed often imposes would captain mchirr have attained or at any rate kept his position if an obstinate disbelief in the barometer had always been a feature of his seamanship might not lord jim have acted upon the fright he got in the harbour as a youth and abandoned a calling for which he was temperamentally unfitted  these are vain frivolous ques tions the whole secret of conrads emotional power depends of course upon the capacity of his characters to take things to heart  tales of hearsay  is full of beautiful passages none perhaps more beautifiul than this  outside the large ingle window the crepuscular light was dying out slowly in a great square gleam vithout colour framed rigidly in the gathering shades of the room  it was a long room the irresistible tide of the night ran into the most distant part of it where the whispering of a mans voice passionately interrupted and passionately renewed seemed to plead against the answering murmurs of infinite sadness it is with such sadness

the poetical work8 of edgar allans poe illus trated edinburgh alexander hislop and co it is one of the misfortunes attendant upon the absence of an international copyrightlaw between this country and america that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an american author in decent type and paper the reason is obvious the market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions that render such an effort much too risky hence it is that american literature whichwith all deference be it spokenshould not scorn adventitious aids is generally associated with dirty grey paper bad type small size and insecure binding let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read romeo juliet published in the form of a dirty tract which may be had in holywell street for twopence let him turn to his own large clear wellprinted edition and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace and light and sweetness that it did not possess before we are glad to perceive therefore that edgar allan poe unquestionably the greatest genius that america has yet producedis at length offered to english readers in a handy and presentable form with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper but it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems failure might have been anticipated at the beginning it was a priori as impossible to translate the dreamlike beauty of annabel lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano the illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e g one or two chaming little landscapes by mr macwhirter but to begin at the beginning did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than mr c j staniland has done with the  raven did mr staniland fancy

best edition of poes poems we know of  the complete works of bret harte collected and revised by the author vol x tales of trail and town 6s chatto and windus the library edition of the works of bret harte is now complete in ten volumes the publishers have done their part well so far as binding and type are concerned though some readers may regret that none of the excellent illustrations which have adorned the earlier editions appear in the new one many reputations have been made and have passed since bret harte gave us the luck of roaring camp and hardly one has stood the test of constant production like his he is now what he was in his early days a writer of excellent stories with a sense of fine workmanship which he has never outraged the present volume contains tales that have already from a photo by john ruskin i886 bari aud proved their power of giving delight but mostly of a recent enough date to be still new to many readers  the poetical works of edgar allan poe with a notice of his life and genius by james hannay 1 esq with twenty illustrationssome of these twenty illustrations are gracefully fantastic the biographical notice is perversely sentimental the story of poes life was told by himself so largely and loudly to the public by the daily papers of america that to attempt to colour over its shames with sympathy and apology is idle the poems with their strange unwholesome unequal vigour nightmare verses if such things can be speak for themselves their writer apart from his works had best be forgotten  literature the works of edgar allan poe edited by john h ingram vols i and ii containing the collected tales london and edinburgh adam  charles black 1874 with jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although mr ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume i do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if i were just a little more mad than ever i waswe can say frankly this is what i am there is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  ligeiaas tothe expression of ligcias eyes he tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj though glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories they are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable if anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable circumstances  the gold bug  the descent into the maelstrom  the cask of amontillado  the oval portrait and the three stories about c auguste dnpin the philosophical detective if he should then desire to read more he may go on but warily there are trapdoors and springguns in these two volumes there are gins and pitfalls and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten one word on the services of mr ingram this edition has evidently been a labour of love with him let us hope in the next two volumes which are to complete the series he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of french which poe was so fond of scattering about his pages there are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under present considerationerrors i should like to

soldiers of fortune by richard hardint davis w heinemann mr richard harding davis is that admirable and uncommon combination of forcesthe journalistnovelist as journalist he knows what is interesting as novelist he knows how to present it to best effect moreover mr davis has vigorous idealse is in love with strength and cleanness with  grit  and resource with heroism and courage in men with beauty and frankness with fadeh arnd youth in women and liking these qualities he also likes writing about them hence to those who are of mr daviss mind as i am for one mr daviss books are always welcome because although he is not subtle although he lacks the genius of his master in the  craft mr kipling mr davis is a good fellow and a very delightful writer and he has the art of sharing his stories hum as his countrymen say g gallegher  is one of the best short stories that we have the van bibber episodes are a continual joy and the princess aline  has more charm than hundreds of more pretentious fictions in the present volume  soldiers of fortune mr davis has given us his first long romance and i thank him for it unreservedly the hero of  soldiers of fortune  is robert clay a young civil engineer of extraordinary force of character cool brave longheaded humorous in every way admirablethe kind of man whom the boys old and youn a mr davis writes for will adopt as an ideal add to clay two youths macwilliams and ted agham both full of enthusiasm and nerve reginald king one of the four hundred of new york a yachtsman lr langham an american financier alice langham and hope langhamhis daughters and then transplant them all to a spanish dependency in south america in a state of revolution where mr laham has acquired halfadozen mountains of iron ore which are being worked under clays supervision then involve them in the civil war raging in the state and after hairbreadth escapes and some good fighting bring them safely through with clay as the accepted loverof the irresistible hope that is what mr davis has done and done excellently well it seems to me now and then he strains a point clay for instance is a shade too near perfection especially for a writer who laughs at ouidas crichtons he was brought up before the mast on an ocean tramp and quotes  the last ride together  but mr daviss faults are au for the readers benefit he never gives short measure the principal characters of the book are so attractive that one wparts from them with sorrow this is how in the words of the intrepid macwilliams hope is described fine sweet girl growled macwilliams i should hope so shes the best they dont make them any better than that and just think if shes like that now what will she be when shes grown upwhen shes learned a few things now her sisteryou can see lust what her sister will be at thirty and at fifty and at eighty shes thoroughbred and shes the most beautiful woman to look at i ever saw but my son she is too careful she hasnt any illusions and no sense of humour and a woman with no illusions and no sense of humour is going to be monotonous you cant teach her anything you cant imagine yourself telling her anything she doesnt know the things we think important dont reach her at all theyre not in her line and in everything else she knows more than we could even guess at but that miss hope its a privilege to show her about she wants to see everhi and learn every and and she goes poking her head into openings and down shafts like a little foxterer and shell sit still and listen with her eyes wide open the tears in them too and tale doesnt know ituntil you cant talk yourself for just looking at her one of the finest scenes in the book is that in which when the three menclay macwilliams and langhamafter the escape of madame alvarez are exposed in the open to the fire of a band of soldiers hope rescues them  as he spoke they saw the carriage plunging out of the shadow of the woods and the horses galloping toward them down the beach macwilliams gave a cheer of welcome  hurrah he shouted  its jose coming for us hes a good man well done jos6  he called i  thats not jose langham cried doubtfully peering through the moonlight  good god its hope he exclaimed he waved his hands frantically above his head  go back hope he cried  go back   but the carriage did not swerve on its way toward them they all saw her now distinctly she was on the drivers box and alone leanin forward and lashing the horses backs with the whip and reins and bending over to avoid the bullets that passed above her head as she came down upon them she stood up her womaus figure outlined clearly in the ridinghabit she still wore jump in when i turn she cried im going to turn slowly run and jump m  mr davis has the dramatic gift he carries you along with him one need not wish for a better story of action than this it may not quite be life but that is one reason why i like it a fountain ssakd by sir walter besant chatto  windus sir walters taste for lovemaking is incorrigible he oonfesses as much himself or which is i suppose the same thing makes his autobiographical heroine confess it i this is a love story for my own part i do not believe that any others are worth reading i am indeed sincerely sorry for all poor women who have no love story of their own one must not magnify the passion of love but certainly there is no other passion that plays so important a part in this transitory life especially for my sex in  a fountain sealed  the ideal society is that of the quake4 represented by the heroines brother in whom religious fervour and shameless pursuit of worldly wealth go hand in hand sir walter has not hit upon a very original treatment of his theme this time the heroine breaks away from quakerism to the outer world of london and becomes the  divine nancy whom rumour assigned as an early flame to george the third sir walter reconstructs the story as he conceives it must have happened and puts it in the mouth of the lady this is her description of her lover ii i declare that if any young man whatever his rank bestowed upon me his affections in the springtime of my days when i posesseed some charms of face and form it was not on account of any allurements or snares but solely on account of those perfections which a generous and noble soul all out of his own nobility imagined in a woman all imperfections the more noble the lover the more heavenly becomes the woman of his imagination such a young man sees in the woman he loves a living well of virtue a sealed fountain a soul all beautiful within and without happy is the woman who is loved by so great a heart for even before her death she may be led upward so as to become an angel of heaven i am bound to say that this does not fit in with my conception of george m the hanoverians do not lend themselves readily to romance and sentimentalism and it does not fit in with the conduct of the story either the prince wooes nancy who is ignorant of his identity everybody else knows but nobody has the decency to tell her a marriage is on the very point of being celebrated when the prince learns the death of the old king his father  my lover my bridegroom who was never to be my husband stood with his face turned upwardsalas  away from his bride and his face was changed there was in it a new authority anew majestythat of the sovereign a new expressionthat of kingship t love had gone out of that face it wa ied with a new emotion the young king saw suddenly before him the vastness of his responsibilities the burden of empire the vast duties what was the simple girl beside him in presence of these kings  war and peace prosperty and adversity the happiness of millions or their ithe sovereignt of a great proud and tree people their love and loyalty or their ate how could love survive that sudden shook  in a moment the passion died out in his heart though the memory of it might afterwards return he was the king needs must that he marry in his own clas  dei gratih he murmured  by the grace of god then he turned to me and his brother rose nancy he said solemnly  fate calls me i am now the kingunworthy pray for me mly brother will see thee what has passed i pray thee to forget thou art all goodness nancy farewell be happy he stooped and kissed my headand i fell back of course the story is put in the mouth of a lovesick woman but i should have been glad of a sign from sir walter besant that he personally agreed with me in thinking that his hero behaved throughout prince or no prince as a common cad but alas no sir walter is capable of irony but in this book irony is reserved not for the lover but for the quakers the historian has his somewhat heartless comment in the preface  youth is attracted by beauty of whatever rank it must be pleant for a prince to step outside his rank and for a time to be treated as an ordinary gentleman  soldiers of fortune by richard harding davis lilus trated by charles dana gibson 69 heinemani something like mr masons man of action appears again in mr daviss story a pioneer in remote regions of the world is strongly defined against a tamer society whose refinements and graces fascinate him and whose womankind he idealises in his loneliness but whatever be the points of resemblance they are obscured by the great fact that  sodiers of fortune is a thoroughly pleasant and cheerful story the literary man is not a cad and if the first fair lady of the heros choice is unsatisfactory she has a sister who is a trump and who behaves handsomely all the way through the book is a romance of the engineering world  there are no men today    who lead as picturesque lives as do civil engineers they are the bravest soldiers of the present day and they are the least recognised so says king the literary traveller and the story forces us to believe it though clays experiences including as they did not only tunnelling mountains diverting river beds bridging roaring canions but also stemming a revolution in a south american republic must be called exceptional then he was amply paid for his past life of lonely hardship for when the revolution camne he was made captain of the forces of order and the lady of his heart was there to see and to help the two keep up a merry game of alternately saving each others lives their pluck and devotion being equally matched and the horrors of slaughter and the fall of dictators hardly disturb only pleasantly entertain us serving merely as a lively spirited background and byplay to the love story

in the year of jubilee by george gissing 3 vols lawrence and butler eves ransom by george gissing lawrence and butler mr gissing is one of the most difficult of all novelists to review fairly when a mood is on him he is relentless in its expression he gives us no relief from it a less able writer would bore us mr gissing never does at his worst he rasps us and makes us flee to fairyland from his terrible array of hard facts in his determination to suppress nothing of the ugliness of the life he paints lower middleclass life by preference he often forgets to take account of the sunlight which is as much a reality as fog if something rarer he feels too strongly to be simply accurate and all through his sincere and honest and merciless and powerful stories we are making mental reservations and combating but combating mostly let us admit the unessentials he forces us to acknowledge that the truth is generally with him this is a somewhat belated review of  in the year of jubilee which most of his readers will already have judged for themselves to those who have not it may be said that the title is significant of nothing in particular or of some truism such as in the year of her gracious majestys jubilee all was not well with england and with camberwell in particular it is a book which every writer and reader must respect marked by good thorough work a very rare knowledge of human nature the absence of all tawdriness all flabbiness in thinking and sentiment at the same time an event a very significant event in the history of the heroine one of the most attractive of mr gissings women is entirely incredible it is no good putting us off with generalities about the unaccountableness of human nature mr gissings business was to convince us that it happened to this particular girl for all he says we reply that it didnt otherwise the story is true cruelly true to a dreary life the hero is admirable if he were ever to become a good man at all it must have been in just such a way turning into one of the most insufferable domestic tyrants we have ever met with in fiction or life whose latter end of respectability is save perhaps to his own immediate belongings worse than the reckless cruelty of his earlier days artistically he is a great success we hope mr gissing did not desire to engage our sympathies for him into the story has been worked a wealth of sensible thought and wellmade characters more than we have room to refer to now but the object of a great deal of mr gissings bitter satire is worth calling attention tothe modern education which unintelligently applied contributes as little to the culture and growth of the mind and heart and soul as if it were conducted in chinese eves ransom is shorter with much fewer personages and perhaps less careful workmanship but unless we are bought and our judgement dazzled by the unusual ray of brightness at the end which made our hearts glad as mr gissings words seldom do it is on the whole a better a more harmonious story mr gissing hates poverty with a burning hatred that it makes for virtue he thinks an unholy lie as of course it is all our modern philanthropy declares the lie but we cant still in words so he gives his hero the chance of a few years cessation from rinding labour the chance of seeing life of feeding his mind and his eye and you can feel his glow of exaltation in his heros freedom but he does not let him have his swing he makes him fall in love forces on him a big sacrifice and gives him nothing in return but the knowledge that he has saved the girl he loves from misery and perhaps from degradation there he leaves him but with a song in his heart and the echo of that song we hope to hear in later novels for after all it is sung in the actual hard world that mr gissing faces so fearlessly eve the complicated young woman for whom the sacrifice was made is worth our interest mr gissing is one of the very few novelists besides mr hardy who dares to endow his attractive heroines with real live faults not only magnificent and interesting vices but mr gissing is apt to take up a scolding and sometimes a priggish attitude towards his women which is for all purposes absolutely useless this observation is however not particularly suggested by eve or by  eves ransom the story is a page of real life not the life that charms us but life at least and we are more understanding towards our fellowbeings after reading it,unmarked_contra
fiction the mantle of elijah by i zangwill heinemann 6s whatever mr zangwill may be worth as an artist it is clear that he is more than a temperamenthe is a force he exercises a gift noticeable in commanding spirits and parodied in mediocritiesthe gift of range he has the large interest in life detached from himself which has been the inspiration of all great as distinguished from little masters in fiction his ego cheerily travels and is impressed by life it is venturesome and industrious therefore it does not starve for lack of subject matter or feed upon itself there is a kind of genius in being a jew but mr zangwill discovered that the ghettos of the world were not enough for him if not the ghettos neither were the studios and so at last we find him penetrating political laboratories elijah is a prophet who preaches peace and economy in days which the younger generation vaguely imagine to have been extinguished under crinolines in the oliveseason elijah became a cabinet minister and nursed an elisha whose precocious taste in mantles awoke his patrons hopes of an appreciative heir to his own but england emerged both from the crinoline and the glasshouse of 1851 and learned to maffic as well as traffic then elijahs mantle went begging for elisha became an imperialist the tragiirony of the book is both general and personal the man who wished to see  the wen of india amputated  and  the spider spinning his web across the cannons mouth  lived to see his own daughterthe sensitive and idealistic allegrasuffer as the wife of a person who when head of a great department of the state fomented a war which beaconsfield himself might have disdained to excuse and this person was elishaa very respectable though incongruous elisha be it added car en apparence toujours il na rien sacrifie rien repudie ni son norn ni ses theories ni  sa surface de radical as m berard says of another english politician broser is elishas workaday name ana it is one that cleverly indicates the formidable tenacity the expansive selfcomplacence and innate coarseness of fibre which characterise him he is to england what the lyons of unleavened bread is to the united states by cunningly describing himself in his election address as  a humble follower of marshmont the elijah of mr zangwills story he involved the latter in  opinions more iconoclastic than he had ever professed yet it was marshmonts  translation  to the upper house which induced broser to propose to his daughter and his humility did not prevent him from remarking to the first mrs broser when she pleaded her inability to converse with political gentlemen  well talk about me that will always interest them but his second helpmeet knew the texture of his humility and when on the occasion of going to a musichall he observed i couldnt risk hanging about ive wired for a box a  suspicion that what he could not risk was being incognito awoke within her a feeling of absolute pity for his limitations on its political side the book is distinctly successful herein mafekingliness so to call itthough mr zangwill has nought to do with south africais viewed philosophically kingdoms progress en mass in legislation and in almanacs but the quality of the type varies hardly at all through the centuries otherwise we would all be beyondmen underneath  rule britannia  breaks the cry  feefofum a primitive cry for blood or treasure the clever journalist and political opportunist are shadowy artists in insincerity euphemism is so habitual with them that to break to them the painful news that black is not white after all is to incur a serious responsibility these are not mr zangwills words but they outline the train of thought which he suggests on the domestic side his novel leaves something to be desired an immaculate lady of the old school found fault with him in our hearing for the pertness of his early victorian children but it must be observed that mr zangwill does not attempt to reproduce the typical early victorian domestic life he makes however a gallant effort to create the aristocracy in their own homes his duchess drops her final s as the privileged may hear the duke of fife do on the platform at this day when allegra remarks that something is an  economic fallacy she exclaims good graciouswhat is the world comin to such a phrase in your mouthits like a cigar did they drop their rs in those days  it hardly matters what does matter is the importation of a type whose presence in a mundane narrative is as perplexing as that of melmoth the wanderer we refer to the philosophical raphael dominick in whose company the probabilities suffer severely it is a character such as a poetromanticist could invest with charm knowing him to be patently of the stuff of dreams he would have filled him with the mellifluously mysterious speech of dreams and he would have been lifeless but beautiful but the lips of this bodiless zangwill open but to emit a crashing discord of clevernesses in chapter xxl book il he avenges bis creation by making even broser momentarily impossible we also object to the manner in which the characters run against one another for the convenience of the plot this is certainly victorianboth early and late the feminine triumph of the book in our opinion is elijahs wife in youth like how many heroines of fiction  she had clasped a hunted hare to her bosom an action that had made elijah fall in love with her but the cherisher of hares was a nagger of the most impracticable kind  you sent him to the shambles she screams to her innocent husband when she heard that their headstrong son had been killed in the war but when elijah is being mobbed for little englandism she rediscovers the hare in him and cries  fight fair you hounds of hell it is probable that this woman will appear overdrawn to many but we can vouch for the fact that she is an ablystudied cymric type allegra the heroine is drawn more ambitiously she writes a letter to her middleage as mrs meynell did to her old age but she uttered no words comparable with these oh in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee suddenly though time darkness silence hide thee this wind from thy lost country flits beside thee yet allegras letter which recurs as a motif in the book rings pathetically true the idealist she thought to marry turned out to be selfinterest under another name the idealist she did not marry was become a mere egoist and for refuge she had nothing better than a motherly representative of the feudalism she had once despised but we must pause mr zangwills book is as a whole worthy of his reputation lt is wise and witty serious and pathetic if it be not all life it is at least life and mr zangwill and the second of these twain is not bad company even when out of place  the mantle of elijah new novels by i zangwill heinemann that the mantle of elijah is worth reading and that it takes a little more than ordinary reading are selfevident facts matter and style combine to warn off the skipping or casual reader without exactly sympathising with mr zangwills points of view you are interested because he presents them and their interpreters in an arresting fashion there is sincerity in some of the intellectual and moral attitudes of his figures his style has matured a great deal since the days some fifteen years ago when  the premier and the painter was published but even then he showed himself to be as now of a different stamp from the facile and obvious novelists of the hour his new book contains cleverness of a very varied kind traits of fine imagination of high spiritual feeling keen observation of the actual and a singular sense of discrimination in character and dialogue jostle each other he has at command a fund of epigrammatic utterances but unlike the general run of such sayings they are not mere interpolations put in for their own sake they spring from the substance and sentiment of his work and may not be easily dissociated from them the principal interest is political it is also retrospective it is the period when crinolines berlin wool and bad ormolu were in vogue mr zangwill enjoys himself over a description of the decoration of a certain clock where art concealed the article so do we in this tale of a bygone timeand here is part of the clevernessmuch in our present political position is not only suggested but even implicitly judged the antiwar note the  lay down your arms is made to echo with no uncertain sound but there is full as much of private human nature as of politics and the domestic horizon and the motives and working of housohold minds are never swamped in the deluge of public affairs at home or abroad twenty years is a long run for the action of a story especially in these days the mantle of elijah almost demands as much for the development of the intellectual and moral forces of the leading characters they require full play and they get it now and then one feels that they almost get too much of it that the analysis and presentation are almost too close too serried the treatment of the engelborne group in the last part is not altogether happy these people are rather copiously than powerfully drawn yet their influence on allegra the heroine is a reason for their being at the age of sixteen allegra is a convinced but not unattractive idealist this is the most entertaining and interesting part of her career when we meet her again in book il she is a married and disenchanted woman of forty or thereabouts her illassorted marriage with broser a radical politician and her fathers secretary never appears wholly credible he is a strongly marked individual one of the best portraits or pictures in this gallery the mantle of the radical statesman an aristocrat by birth drops at length on the brawny shoulders of broser his follower only too ready to catch it he is the most robust and selfseeking of all the sons of the people yet depicted in fiction one feels the jarring aggressiveness of the man and the coarse germs of good and evil in his temperament he is strangely real the contrast between him and his amiable highsouled leader and the family is an excellent study the list of the peoples grievances and their remedies drawn up by broser and those mr zangwill calls  the boon companions of his political intoxication  is good satire so are his entrance into the house and his subsequent change of front then there is a visionary and much less strongly conceived being an israelite who rhapsodises on a new spiritual species adapting itself to a new spiritual environment and other recondite topics the closing scenes wherein he and a poisoned dagger figure show a slight uncertainty and a weakening hold on the situation and the characters how clever and shrewd on the other hand are the parts about prof otto pont one of the minor personages and the duchess her family and feudal surroundings are occasionally funny is  gals for girls an idiosyncrasy of this particular duchess or a habit of all duchesses the absence of sufficient data prompts the question the exact epoch of the story is clearly set the great exhibition of 1851 has already taken place before the end the francoprussian war must have been more than in the air though there is no mention of it a war with novabarba is mentioned but is so wrapped up in conditions and circumstances past present or to be that it is not easy nor necessary to disentangle it one does not care to look for discrepancies and anachronisms where there

sister teresa new novels by george moore fisher unwin mb moore gave no hint if we mistake not in the first edition of  evelyn innes that he intended to write a sequel so that although there is no suggestion of it there is still a possibility that  sister teresa may be followed by a third volume to complete the tragedy of evelyn inness career the need certainly seems to arise for it for the end arrived at in sister teresa is distinctly a case of bathos it will be remembered that evelyn inns was j represented in the first book as a person in o whom sensuality and idealism were constantly struggling for the mastery and there the struggle was left undecided in sister teresa the struggle still goes on only to cease at the end not because any solution has been come to but because evelyn has been ill and she finds that she has not the physical courage to escape from the convent as she had meant to do and that she can do no more than settle down to an inert vegetable existence as a music mistress in a convent school a dead soulless existence is undoubtedly a frequent outcome of such a struggle as there was in evelyns nature but it is no solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great novel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a novel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are

gg   he must go with her to the pure country to the woods and to the places where the invisible ones whom the druids knew etc  wandering in the woods and underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore novelist pure and simple we shall be content  notes on

the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and

twentyfive years reminiscences stories and memories by katharine tynan smith elder and co ios 6d net it is required in writers of reminiscences that they possess one of two qualifications either they must have worthy matter to set down or they must have a worthy manner of retailing happenings of small moment in the larger world of affairs with our new psychological scale of values there has come about a new perspective in the relative importance of events thus things that to a former generation seemed of mighty concern now bulk much less largely in our estimation while a detail that one of the older historians would have passed over entirely is now magnified and given its true significance and force so it frequently happens that for sheer enjoyment and for actual edification using that term in its widest sense a book full of memories of the most trivial kind will outshine weightier works both on account of the charm of its style and because of its wealth of significance when both matter and manner are of the highest order the result is likely to become a classic miss katharine tynan for she is not yet mrs hinkson in this volume has brought out of the treasures of memory things both great and small holding the balance pretty evenly between the trivial and the weighty and exhibiting all with much happiness of manner the whole work reminds one of a delightful oldfashioned garden in which one can wander at will and pluck many fragrant and beautiful blooms we turn to the greater names first and find a goodly list sir charles russell gladstone parnell cardinal manning the morrises the rossettis the meynells william sharp w b yeats and george russell ae miss tynan was introduced to gladstone at the house of sir charles russell but the encounter that made the most impression on that occasion was her meeting with parnell towards whom her attitude is throughout worshipful indeed whether one loves or hates that tragic yet fascinating figure one cannot but admire the wholehearted devotion of miss tynan to him and to his cause there is much concerning parnell and much of the writers association with the land league which will interest students of that particular history a very distinct and rather amusing picture of christina rossetti emerges on page 158 she entered the room wearing short serviceable skirts of an irongrey tweed and stout boots her dress did not at all go with her spiritual face and the heavilylidded wideapart eyes which one only finds in a highlygifted woman  i certainly believe she made the worst of herself perhaps as a species of mortification she even affected a short matteroffact way of speaking which took me somewhat aback at our first meeting she put one off sitting at her feet completely concerning william sharp the author says decisively  i may say here that i do not even yet believe that william sharp was fiona macleod but of that more in its proper place on that point we looked anxiously for further enlightenment but found none so we presume we must wait for one of the two further volumes of memories which miss tynan hopes to publish the few glimpses of wilde are not very flattering he seems never to have sparkled in her presence there is a great deal about w b yeats the earlier reminiscences partake very much of the nature of loving banter we imagine that the future biographer of the irish poet may some day be very grateful to miss tynan for her pages on his early development very interesting and curious it is to read of his entire absorption in poetry during youthhe lived breathed ate drank and slept poetry in another place she says i remember how the big dublin policemen used to eye him in those days as though uncertain whether to run him in or not but by and by they used to say shure tisnt mad he is nor yet drink taken tis the poethry thats disturbin his head and leave him alone in his inability to take care of himself and his utter forgetfulness of all but poetry he fulfils the traditional figure of a poet in his youth pretty completely further later reminiscences and a number of letters round off this part of miss tynans book equally interesting is the romantic personality of george russell to whose poetry the english public seems just awakening there is something almost olympian about his figure he tells what is perhaps one of the best stories in the volume he told me a story the other day of a friend of his who somewhere in the wilds of america became friends with an old indian he told him all the marvels of the old worldwireless telegraphy radium men flying in air speech kept long after the speaker is dead wonderful wonderful said the indian tell me more at last the reciter paused wearied the white man is very wonderful said the indian can he do this he stooped lifted a handful of dust and threw it in the air stretched himself upwards and thin delicate flames ascended from his hands and his feet and his hair his body shone in air he was a living jewel from head to foot then the glory faded there was only an old indian can the white man do that he asked it is required also of writers of reminiscences that they should display a certain degree of intimacy and should refrain as far as possible from the use of limelight here again miss tynan satisfies our requirements one does feel closing her book that one has really got to know her the person who emerges with perhaps greatest distinctness from her pages is her own father his strong points and weaknesses are alike set down with a loving pen he is very lovable very human with more than a touch of greatness we are grateful too for the accounts of one or two early friends who died untimely some of them showing considerable promise rose kavanagh frances wynne charles g fagan and jim alderson they are written of with an affection that it is good to see in these reticent days of lesser points we might mention a score if space allowed such as miss tynans theory that hair is an index to character or the naive confession of her early earnings and how she spent them in a way that would shock the unco guid or this single characteristic flash of memory of g b s who in

natural description possibly and in  the maid of sker there was at least one character of more intense individuality but the present novel is remarkable for its general merit given unquestionable genius at the outsetwhich mr blackmore possesseswe should expect an author to ripen in this manner so that his work while it may not impress us for the force of any single attribute will leave upon us a very distinct idea of power that a novel should be styled a worthy suc cessor to the two works we have just named is no mean tribute yet it is one which we are able to pay on the present occasion in the fullest and frankest manner one point has especially struck us in relation to the present story and that is the utter lack of straining after effect either by a spasmodic brilliancy of style or sensationalism of plot the gentleman and the scholar are alike perceptible in every chapter and we are never in a state of dubiety as to the healthy morality he would teach of absolute flinging of moral lessons at the head of the reader there is indeed very little but the whole might very well be placed before the hysterical and sensuous school who having gratified the lower passions of their readers throw an occasional sop to the almighty by patronising religion the true end of the novelist mr blackmore always keeps in viewnamely that of telling the unvarnished history of any character he undertakes to depict one incident at the close of his latest story would in other hands have appeared unreal and grotesque but the author has so manipulated it that it adds to the effect of his work

in this strain let th wings of imagination spread themselves in a more favourable direction this interview must close on my part with a suggestive but perhaps selfevident proposition hilary the door is open hilary avails himself of the parental suggestion and goes off to the war in the peninsula as he finds he cannot give up his love for the growers daughter the young recruit covers himself with glory at ciudad rodrigo and other places and becomes very popular with all the fellows in his regiment on one occasion he gets desperately wounded and is tended during his illness by the lovely daughters of the count of zamora one of these goes very near wounding him deeply in the region of the heart and he does not get released from his entanglement except at a very severe cost she is the means of his losing 50000 guineas the property of the british army for which he is cashiered by the duke of wellington he afterwards however recovers his credit meanwhile during this history what has become of the heroine who gives the title to the book  alice is a truly noble highspirited girl a proposition is made to her by her grandmotherwho eventually obtains sir rolands consent to the matchthat she should marry captain chapman the disreputable son of sir remnant chapman a landowner who has got possession of too many of the lorraine acres lady valeria lorraine thinks this would be

lorraine is stricken with illness when he learns of his daughters supposed suicide a happy event hastens the story to a happy end mabel lovejoy has an immense fortune left to her which is generously given to the lorraines by her father and hersolf and alice and hilary are thus both savedthe former to marry major aylmer a brave british officer and the latter to reconcile sir roland to his union with mabel the above is the merest outline of the story and gives no idea of the quantity of byplay which runs through the volumes some of the best drawn characters are those which are least prominent notably the rev struan hales a sporting parson of the old type and bonny a boy wvho owns a donkey which may lay claim to more intelligence than we should be willing to concede to half the human race these three sketches of two bipeds and one quadruped are  really inimitable and serve as an outlet for mr blackmores peculiar vein of humour we wish it were our fate to read more novels of this description  a terror would then pass into a joy alice lorraine is a book it would be impossible to feel dull over it contains riot a single nninterestimig clhalptr and undoubtedly sustains its

for sons of gentlemen by kerr shaw dent 7s 6d the author imagines a school which is an old foundation and shows its failure because it will not take in scholars of humble birth though it lives on tradition it has forgotten the purpose of its founder and developed a social snobbery which is oppressive one of the chief characters and sufferers is a man who has to pay a large sum to become a housemaster and gains nothing substantial by it being always loaded with debt this business of catering which is the usual means abler masters have for advancement is not at all pleasant and generally the author puts forward his propaganda effectively we are rather surprised to find straye college provided with so much professional help in cricket more than was considered necessary at one of the leading public schools some years since its position is peculiar because being at first on the outskirts of london it gets gradually surrounded by the buildings of an increasing population the figures of the story are well done and a good surprise is managed at the end concerning the master who provides unsparing criticism throughout evidently kerr shaw knows the schoolmasters troubles and trials,unmarked_contra
