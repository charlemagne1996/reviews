a mortal antipathy first opening of the jnew portfolio by oliver wendell holmes sampson low the result of dr holmess first opening of his new portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels elsie tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature the interest of the second story the guardian angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little indian blood whioh flows in her veins the new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia for the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman the unfortunate maurice kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger we are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him the book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer although dr holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards writing has only been his pastime he did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside in 1857 the atlantic monthly was started and its then editor james russell lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor the  breakfast table series  was the result the whole amount of dr holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings for the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind his name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time he is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing his  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar thoreau once said of john brown  he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but i do not think dr holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if brown had been guilty of illusing an h he would certainly not have forgiven him the new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy notwithstanding j his numerous verses dr holmes is still a professional man and not a poet the poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal to the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease however interesting the cases exhibited by dr holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust elsie fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters in the guardian anyel and still more in a mortal antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate moreover in the character of elsie venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either myrtle hazard or maurice kirkwood dr holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere he concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue he can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us the introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book in it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits he can bc serious of course but never solemn he is serious here looking back to his early life he has a few kindly words to say about willis who was then  by far the most prominent american author it was a time of literary dearth when willis and griswold were bright particular stars no one now regards willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind what he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read dr holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and though subject of the work  the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one no matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi though person whose life he is writing when he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on emerson   for many months i havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature if the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline dr holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour his verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world without the genius of calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humorous than mark twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance his range is narrow perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  breakfast table series  alone although in these pages dr holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit an author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix enough if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them dr holmes unlike some othersmay still be trusted with a pen did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it i waltek lewin,northamerica
the gospel writ in steel by arthur paterson innes 6s mr paterson like mr stephen crane goes for his local colour to the american war of secession but unlike mr crane he is less in quest of impressions than of melodrama of this he finds plenty the hero john burletson is a wonderful young man he stays at home from the war for the sake of his widowed mother then for the sake of the girl he loves he joins shermans army as a courier in the hope of rescuing his more fortunate rival from a rebel prison he not only does this but proves himself a military genius and wins the personal thanks of abraham lincoln for his services and in the end the fortunate rival handsomely gives him up the girl john burletsons military adventures seem to us who know nothing of war wildly improbable but they are undeniably exciting reading the sentimental parts of the book on the other hand fail altogether either to convince or interest us,northamerica
ethan frome by edith wharton 3s 6d net mlac millan mrs wharton has more than satisfied ones expectation and her art has never been shown to greater advantage than in this story of ethan frome the young massachusetts farmer it is a tragedy almost unendurably poignant but justified by its inevitableness from his youth fate dealt hardly with ethan his father died leaving him a bleak unproductive farm and a failing sawmill after a lingering illness his mother also died that was in the fall had it been in the spring his future might have been different but ethan dared not face the winter alone in this  new england farmhouse that made the landscape lonelier then he took his first step towvard the abyss he asked zeena the tall uncomely rawboned woman who had nursed his mother to be his wife from that time his life was a martyrdom for zeena soon showved her real character as a sickly querulous neurotic then came the next stroke of destiny to save expense for the poverty at the farm was grinding mattie silver the penniless young cousin of zeena was invited to live with them as the girl served without pay her cousin suggested that on the rare occasions when there was an entertainment in the village mattie should go to it so that she should not feel too sharp a contrast between the life she had left and the isolation of the farm on these occasions ethan although at first he had inwardly demurred at the extra toil imposed on him was accustomed to fetch home his wifes cousin soon he found himself wishing that the village might give all its nights to revelry gradually the wifes suspicions are aroused a hired girl is employed and mattie must go poverty makes ethan helpless money might have saved two lives if not three but there is none so the blow falls in the last act that is to consign the three to a living death it is a beautiful sad but intensely human story working out to its final conclusion with all the inevitability of a great greek tragedy  ethan fromne by edith wharton macmillan 3s 6d net among modern american writers mrs edith wharton has long since attained a welldeserved reputation as one whose books are both in matter and manner far above the average she invariably compels attention and repays the attention which she thus forces in the coin of intellectual pleasure the present story is well suited to take its place beside mrs whartons previous volumes its extent is not considerable but mrs whartons very restraint in the matter of words has increased the power which she so ably wields her example might well be followed by many a novelist by whom superfluity of verbiage is almost acclaimed as a virtue many of them ought to be willing to sacrifice much in order to be able to produce a little tragedy of such power as this or to show themselves such masters of their common art as mrs whartons work repeatedly proves her to be the little story is a pure tragedy the scene is laid in a lonely semidesolate new england village which has been left aside in the modern march of progress here it is for the most part amidst the snowfor it is a commonplace in stackfield that no soul can survive many of its wintersthat the touching lifestory of ethan from is unfolded a victim of an unsuitable marriage suffering perpetually from the nagging and the querulousness of his invalid wife half of whose ills are rooted in imagination and are therefore all the worse to herself and all with whom she comes in contact for a moment happiness and romance play before him like a willothewisp ethan was not strong enough to seize them or perhaps we should say that circumstances were stronger than he not even the obvious halfconventional solution was permitted to him and ethan returns to life and the drabcoloured realities with his miseries increased a hundredfold and new agonies created of whichhe had previously been unconscious the only relief throughout the volume is the lovepassages and these are so vivid and so realistic that one forgets the shade out of which one passes in order to reach them and basking in their sunshine almost sees them pass before the physical eye the book is slight in form but in texture it is full  fiction ethan frome by edith wharton macmillan 3s 6d net in this small volume within the limits of a story half the length of an ordinary novel mrs wharton has done all and more than other novelists would have done in the greater space there is no living novelist who knows better how to construct a story the book is a model of compression every stroke tells every detail of conversation or incident has its essential place in the structure but the effect is not that of thin economy it is rich and full in the earlier part of the story there are incidents the suggestions of which are grimly and tragically realised in the conclusion mrs wharton has a skill which she can only have learned from the greek tragedians in preparing by dramatic contrasts irony and reversal of fortune for the passionate denouement but no skill alone could have produced such stress and tenseness such exaltation and depression so highly emotional a romance brought to the dust with realistic cruelty to mrs whartons vivid and romantic imagination is added a hard sense of fact conceive the elated moods of stevenson tempered by the grimmest touches of zola and you have the holocaust of romantic passion and horrid fact which mrs wharton can serve up to us she prepares us for the catastrophe from the beginning showing to us the old man ethan frome years  after the accident with the gash still showing on his forehead and his right side shortened and warped still living at the bleak solitary farmhouse on the hillside working his meagre farm coming in to starkfield rarely and speaking seldom for he has had troubles and the neighbours respect his gloom and then we see him in his youth aged twentyeight when the trouble is brewing his home is shared by two women one is his wife zeena older than himself who had nursed his dying mother whom he had married from sheer dread of solitude she is tall bony fretful a nalade imaginaire nursing herself on patent medicines her teeth are false she looks hideous in bed she complains at everything and nags mrs zeena from is shown in the fewest words of conversation and description but the portrait of this neurasthenic fixes itself on the mind a memorable thing the other woman is zeenas cousin mattie an orphan homeless she has been taken under zeenas roof to do the work of a hired girl without wages the situation is obvious enoughbut nothing is banal when it comes under mrs whartons hand ethan adores mattie a years companionship with two such women has wrought upon him in a sense it is a mere lovestory the love of ethan for a woman to whom he must not declare himself and the  this is our second notice of elhau frow love of mattie for ethan but it is a lovestory invested with the true tragic poignancy the two are only driven to selfrevelation by the jealousy and remorselessness of zeena for one day and night zeena goes away to see a doctor and hatch her plot in the evening ethan and mattie sit by the fire in the usual manner save that the seat of zeena is empty they talk about indifferent matters shyly and in dread of breaking the sweetness of their one evening they shun the name of zeena which creeps into their conversation hauntingly as a thing of dread and ethan sees mattie as she might be in his house were zeena dead we know no description of love equal to this in contemporary english or american literature since mr hardy was at his best every little thing that happens from the spreading of the table to the breaking of the picklepot is made ominous we will not tell how mattie is driven away by zeena how ethan takes her for the last time but one down the toboggan slide and how before the inevitability of parting they resolve on one more rush down the slope not past but into the dreaded elm we merely point out that this magnificent tempestuous passage concerning the lovers resolve to die is followed by the far grimmer conclusion the taking away of the two maimed but not dead bodies and the subsequent years of sinister grumbling and ugliness that is the way in which mrs wharton nerves herself to end her story it is the cruel modern way it is bitter it is almost intolerablefor we were absorbed in the fate of these personsbut it is brilliant  ethan frome by edith wharton macmillan and co 3s 6d net if one may judge by miss whartons story starkfield mass must be a very dreary place the story itself is another variation of the eternal triangle two women and a man with a rather good ending in that the man and the woman he ought to have married attempted to commit suicide in order to solve their difficulty and be at rest togetherand the attempt failed with such possibilities of psychological study as are presented by ethan from and zeena his wife to say nothing of mattie there was material for a great though somewhat sombre and tragic work miss wharton has suggested this and in the slight sketch which she has given of these three lives has conveyed a sense of reality with her pictures of american rural life,northamerica

lin mclean by owen wister owen wister is the new american novelist of the cattle ranch and lin mclean is his hero lin is a cowpuncher independent fearless humorous resourceful truthful and like most other persons in this virile gusty book utterly lawless and richly idiomatic in his talk the episodes are stirring and wild and sometimes luridly powerful pistol shots are not much less frequent than commas harper  brothers 278 pp 6s  lin mclean by owen wister harper  brothersmr wister gives some very lively pictures of life in wyoming when it was a territory with a future instead of a state with a past the good old days of which he speaks seem to have grown old rather quickly they were the days of railroads but before the days of diningcars the talk of the people was extremely racy and one would say that modern idiom can hardly have improved upon it whether mr wister is historically exact or not matters little however his incisive style fixes ones attention and town and country man and beast and woman too are all set before one as clearly as in a photograph the story is not so precise it is presented as a series of episodes and possibly the chapters were published separately as one finds in them a certain amount of recapitulation  but this may be only for the convenience of tihort memories mr wisters reputation in america is considerable and it seems well deserved,northamerica
the spoilers by edwin pugh newnes 6s having read about half mr pughs book just before going to bed we passed a wretched night before the next day was out we had read the rest and slept soundly for if he tells us exactly how the next burglar will enter our house he tells us later by how simple and cheap a contrivance we can be sure that we hear him when he does indeed we are not sure that so thorough a knowledge of burglars and their ways must not be held to imply a misspent youth surely practical experience alone but there is a law of libel and we must hold our hand  hastening to assure mr pugh that if he forces us to suspect him of having been a burglar he forces us also to acknowledge him a very able novelist his story suggests in some ways  oliver twist here is bill sikes chick marketer here is nancy judith and here is fagin bill fix but here emphatically is not oliver mr pugh has a boy indeeddeuce marketer by name  but he is such a real boy such an absolute boy so full of actuality and life and  the real thing that we must apologise for mentioning him in the same breath with that bloodless little prig oliver perhaps miss porch and mr gandy are a little dickensy but they are genuine enough and fill a necessary place in a story that has turn and turn about thrilled us with dread and pity and set us laughing aloud with its natural inevitable humour the spoilers is a capital book  the spoilers by edwin pugh newnes in this curious and clever novel mr pugh has sought to combine uncompromising realism with a kind of genial humorous sentimental caricature of life upon the whole the story is successful but its success is rather despite than because of the combination referred to the book would have been better without the sections of dickensiana which are inserted among genuine studies of the netherworld of london  and that because the first named are not realthey are fustian pinchbeck a careful imitation on his central character a newly released convict on ticketofleave who takes up his abode with an old  fence and steals the affections of a girl who is engaged to a preacher and reformed thiefa careful and exact studythe author is to be congratulated the exconvicts adventures are unsavoury in the extreme but the sketch of the man is interesting because it is absolutely real there is not much art in the volume mr pughs literary judgement is faulty and he is weak in construction but there is vivid photography the authors stock of thieves slang is notable there is no makebelieve in mr pughs handling of his really lowclass characters and so his book is worth reading particularly for the student of london,northamerica

the love of parson lord and other stories by mary e wilkins five short stories of new england life very characteristic of their author whose portrait is given as frontispiece  three old sisters and one beau  is a oharming little sketch ending thus  the old bride passed up the aisle with her old bridegroom and a smile of youth that triumphed over age and memory shone on her old face through her white veil and no one ever knew whether she wore her own or her sisters weddinggown or had wedded her own or her sisters old beau harpers 6s  the love of parson lord and other stories short stories ay mary ju wilkins harper  crothers parson lord had made a rash vow that his daughter should be dedicated to missionary work  but love for her led him to give her secretly as if from somebody else dolls furs and pretty clothes and at last to let her marry though without his express consent the story is well told and the parson is one of those new england studies in which miss wilkins is particularly successful  the tree of knowledge strains probability rather hard an extremely innocent and rather romantic girl seeing a man prowling about on a very cold night goes down and opens the front door but meanwhile the mana gentleman burglarhad climbed in at the parlour window she apologises to him for want of hospitality takes him to a fire offers wine and calls her sister they insist on giving him supper and a bed and he becomes a new man and ultimately marries the young lady the elder sister had brought up the younger one by writing her loveletters from an imaginary admirer who exhibited the highest principles the whole thing is droll and not without humour there are three other stories in the book one of them shows very prettily the sort of way in which new englanders look back with pride at their english origin and with greater pride at their american independence the collection shows a good deal of variety nd makes a very agreeable volume the queens ttvin and other stories by sarah orne jowett smith elder  co miss jewett like miss wilkins is of the new england school but she is a little less severe she seems to take less delight in describing the drear austerities of religious life miss wilkins often dwells upon the past miss jewett is content with the present miss jewetts stories therefore seem to have something more human about them though they are perhaps not so ingeniously constructed as miss wilkinss stories  the queens twin is a description of a visit to an old woman in maine who was born at the same time as her majesty who married a man named albert and who called her children by the same names as those of our own royal family she had once been in london and had seen the queen and with this recollection and these facts her old age was comforted this pretty fancy as miss jewett works it out makes a touching little study one or two of the other stories in the volume are a little difficult to read on account of the irishamerican dialect but there is a pleasant genial spirit about them all in the green flag and other stories smith  elder dr conan doyle has collected the specimens of his recent work which he thinks most worthy to survive the result is very readable not artistic as the short story is or ought to be at its best these stories shone in the magazines  they do not appear so distinguished when viewed by themselves undoubtedly however they appeal strongly to the average englishman and sportsman  novel notes the love of parson lord and other stories by mary e wilkins illustrated 6s harpers there is nothing new to be said of miss wilkins but it is always worth while spreading the news that she has sent out a new book that can stand honourably by the side of her old ones here save in the tale of catherine carr which strikes miss mary e wilkins a dew portrait of miss mary e wilkins from a miniature repro duced from the frontispiece of her new book by kind permission of messrs harper bros a more heroic or rather a more military note than usual the stories are made out of the material she has made us know so well and feel so much curiosity about she has not come to the end of her digging in new england hearts nor shown all the beauty hidden in the starved soil nor all the grim tragedy strange with all her daintiness no writer of today has more ugly things to tell out of her record of life in one light the title story is a pretty idyll of a girl and a doll and of the same girl with a devoted lover but the circumstances out of which the child so fearfully snatches her happiness are ghastly and a sensitive reader will shudder no less at this revelation of cruel clean austerity than at some tale of the horrors of the inquisition the chief treasure of the volume is we think  one good time in which the glorious dream of all the household drudges of the earth is pictured forth with much sympathy,northamerica
the chief of the ranges by h a cody hodder  stoughton 6sj the story is somewhat fragmentary and lacking in dramatic interest yet the author displays an intimate acquaintance with indian life and character the book deals with thc adventures of ouindia daughter of an indian chief natsate her lover and roger dean an old trader of the plains feuds between the chilcot and ayana indians are well portrayed and in his description of life in the yukon and the canadian northwest the author exhibits a practical acquaintance with his subject,northamerica

towards though ne  cessity of resignation to though dispensations of a higher tower 14 how beautiful the sun is mamma said littlo 1 anna as she gazed upon the sky  it looks as if it was walking down into the sea what aro they doing at fairfield now   44 probably gathering in the harvest my love nelson and anna were side by side and the remem 1 brance of old harvesthomes at fairfield suddenly shot through them both and therewith a vision of jessio the presiding spirit nelson seemed to long to pierce through that glorious red heaven to the fairfield beyond it as did the child who expressed his thought 44 if i were in the sun i would not go down into though sea but i would stop at fairfield ah  what is that mamma i seo something coming between the sun and the seafar fur away is that fairfield 44 land land shouted n joyful voice from some other point of the ship 411 liavo seon fairfield said littlo anna whilst a a sudden glow overspread her face  but the excitement was too much for her and she was obliged to be taken down to the cabin all that night whilst the gallant ship was making rapid progress athwart though dark waters towards that 44 land of promise though wellbeloved england the child was to all appearance passing away she did not speak but lay as in a soft sleep scarcely breathing oh  who shall tell the prayers of that agonised mother should her child die within sight of landwithin a few hours sail of her brothers home no those prayers were heard even whilst she knelt by her childs couch and seemed to await her last breath nelson who had been pacing half the weary night through upon deck came to tell her that they were sailing on the thames and would soon be in the docks 14thank god was all sho said as she burst into a flood of tears the child was aroused and understood that all was right 44 dont cry mamma we are come to fairfield she murmured  about miduight jessie was aroused from her painful meditations by the wandering words of little anna she seemed to be either dreaming or pursuing the train of thought begun in a dream 44 what pretty flowers  let me see the harvesthome mamma aunt jessie may i feed the pigeons where are all the rest i want to see little brother and uncle pynsent jessie perceiving that she was awake rang the bell for her brother and went still nearer to her she put out her hand 41 fairfield is very pretty it must be like heaven here pynsent came 44 here is uncle pynsent my love said jessie the child smiled pynsent felt her pulse and looked steadfastly into her eyes 4 you had better call anna he said44 she is sinking i will get her something to take  but this cannot last 44 where is uncle nelson  asked the sufferer 141 will bring him replied pynsent gently he went into the drawingroom where anna was asleep ou the sofa 44 anna he said gently awaking her 4 i am afraid your little one is worse she has just awoke and perhaps you had better go to her it seems a great mercy that she should be permitted to come here does it not my dear sister 441 knowi know what you mean shrieked anna 44 she is dyingalie cannot be saved i 44 hush anna all depends on her being kept quiet and having no excitement anna threwherself for a moment on her brothers neck 44oh pynsent pity me i am so wretchedso wretched  lonely lonely heartbroken pynsent embraced her tenderly 44 my own anna my dear sister he said lovingly 44 remember you have brothers and a sister and a beautiful child still left you for all our sakes try to compose yourself 44mamma my own marama was heard through though folding doors little anna had heard her mother weep anna went to her and pynsent went down stairs whence be returned with a soothingdraught and accompanied by nelson jessie had been giving little anna food and was seated on the bed supporting her in her arms anna was kneeling on the other side 41 uncle said the child to nelson  i have got aunt jessie and i shall go to heaven from fairfield will you tell mo about the little children and jesus christ nelson went to the head of the bed opposite jessie and bending over the child said slowly 44 suffer little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven 44 mamma may i go to jesus christ said little anna to her mother whose hand she held and who in reply could only bury her face in the bedclothes to check her sobs nelson went on gently whispering to the child of the love of christ for his children his tender lambs and she with a quiet smile leaned back on jessies shoulder and fell asleep was it sleep or death  they could not tell nelson helped to support her and thus between jessie and him annas child went away from this world and was born by angels to him who 44 gathereth the lambs in his arms the minor characters are well drawn and deserving of attention pynsent burton the doctor brother louisa colville and two uncles are well distinguished the artist brother and tiny his artist wife are well described and naturally invested with some dramatic attributes there is however a total absence of counterinterest we deplore the absence of a villain mr michelson father of chatham is only cold and disagreeable and even he repents while mrs hicks a depredating housekeeper only becomes villainous towards the end of the story does very little beyond cheating her master and burning some letters during his illness her evil disposition causes but a temporary inconvenience and evidently did not enter into miss beales original scheme mrs hicks being at first represented as rather pleasant than otherwise the greatest fault of this novel as a work of art is the disregard of dramatic balance the story proceeds through three volumes equal in length to at least a dozen by alexandre dumas and there is no reason why it should not pro ceed for many years longer with sequels and continuations equal to those of that mighty weaver of interesting tales the story is too even and equal lt lias no rise and no fall and we should not feel surprised at the successive appearance of separate works such as 44 jessie a continuation of 44 simplicity and fascination 44annabella sequel to 44jessie chatham michelson being the second series 44 tiny and in fact a hundred other works gliding one after the other with the creamy smoothness of the one before us miss beales description of wales and her knowledge of somersetshire localities answer well to the general tenor of her work  and her apparently personal objections to our course of policy in india will meet with the hearty concurrence of many of our readers it is hardly necessary for us to tell our readers that mr brooks is a very clever man and au accomplished writer all who keep themselves au courant of the passing literature of the day know his pleasant epigrammatic style and recognise his versatile fluency in travels vaudevilles and weekly newspapers accordingly when it was known that this untiring author had a three volume novel in the press great expectations were raised among the lovers of good books for his name was full of promise we hardly like to say that the promise has not been quite fulfilled  for is not the book full of clever sayings  are not its pages pitillantes of wit  whereas ninetenths of the novels of the day are equally dull and flippant mr brooks then has written a book far superior to the general run of circulating library novels undoubtedly he has but a man of his talents is hardly likely to be satisfied with such an achievement as this we presume at least that he has the laudable ambition to fill a more prominent place in the walhalla of literature and to see his works classed with those of the few great writers of prose fiction whose tales we are almost loth to call novelsa good name in itself but dishonoured by its application to every sickly story without plot invention or character which corrupts the taste if not the morals of precocious schoolboys and lovesick milliners such a position mr brooks has hardly won for the book before us clever as it undoubtedly is with much excellent writing with considerable knowledge of the world and without ono particle of dulness still as an artistical work it has many grave blemishes and offences against taste these will prevent its taking the place in literature which a novel by mr brooks ought to take the story is very complicated a debauched spendthrift mr wilmslow with a channing wife and three pretty daughters is placed in possession of a fine estate in gloucestershire aspen court through the intervention of an attorney mr molesworth whose confidential clerk mr bernard carlyonthe hero of the bookis sent down to aspen court to superintend the installation of the family and to exercise a salutary control over mr wilmslowas ferocious a domestic tyrant and consequently as arrant a coward as ever beat his wife in seven dials mr carlyon in one of his walks in the neighbourhood rescues a young lady from some rustic robbers the young lady is lilian trevelyan the representative of the family ejected by mr molesworth to make room for the wilmslows of course mr carlyon falls in love with her  of course she reciprocates  and of course in the third volume they marry but there are plenty of difficulties to overcome in the second volume and one or two wily enemies to outgeneral or defeat the most formidable are the earl of rookbury and the reverend cyprian heywood a roman catholic priest lord rookbury is a clever unprincipled old roue very charming and very gentlemanlike very avaricious and an unblushing liar mr heywood is a catholic without faith and a jesuit who laughs at his vows he is a sort of mortal mephistopheles with a power of prescience omniscience and ubiquity more vraisemblable in a german romance or in a french melo drama than in a story purporting to describe english life and character in the reign of queen victoria the peer who for his own ends wishes to do good service to carlyon persuades mr selwyn a cabinet minister and one of the bestdrawn characters in the book to take the young man as his private secretary then come plot intrigue chicanery of ali kinds lord rookbury plots against mr heywood mr molesworth against both and all three mystify bemard who has a difficult game to play among them all the fault which we have to find with the story is that it is too intricate and perplexing and but this is the case very often in actual life that there seems no adequate cause no perceptible motive for some of the subtlest machinations of the jesuit or the most daring falsehoods of the nobleman the frequent episodical chapters and thc introduction of an undue quantity of supernumeraries to speak theatrically who have nothing whatever to do with the 44business of the book are also we consider drawbacks to the merit of 44 aspen court paul chequerbent is but a ghostly revival of mr dickenss dick swheller mr molesworths clerk is far less amusing than miss sally brasss assistant and though meant to be more gentle manly and made to associate with men of fashion he is after all but a poor snob the chapters describing his policecourt adventures and gravesend junketings with angela livingstone a transpontine actress are in the worst possible taste we are sure that if mr brooks had allowed himself time to 4weed and to revise his book he would never have sent to press such vulgar trash the supperscene at mrs foresters is still more unfit for the pages of an english novel mrs forester a warmlydescribed widow is in love with selwyn the secretary of state after the opera one saturday night she invites carlyon whom she has only once before seen to supper promising him a pleasant party no one is there however but the widow and a young protegee miss maynard  a strange young lady who in the third volume carries otf heywood the infidel priest to america whore they turn mormons ho played his part well whipped the trifle called talk with an adroit hand and finding that the slightest dash of foreign flavour was not unwelcome to the taste of mrs forester he availed himself of certain parisian recollections which if indiscreetho managed discreetly enough and which were quietly appreciated by lucy forester and it must be said still more evidently relished by mary maynard and the littlo supper being perfectly served and mrs foresters wine being so exquisite that carlyon wondered who could attend to it for her the party became exceedingly radiant as the sabbath came in mrs forester lay back in her delightful chair and resting her classic head upon a soft little cushion listened with the most charming smile and retorted without taking the trouble to move her eyes from the lamp while that strange mary maynard under some pretence or other had curled herself up in a corner of the couch on which bernard was and sat in a sort of oriental attitude which had many advantages not the least being that it enabled carlyon to observe that her foot was exceedingly pretty      44 take care of him mary said she in a curious tone as she left the room as the door closed bernard turned to his attractive companion and found she was gazing wistfully at him with something like preparations for a cry what hard creatures men are his thoughts immediately recurred to the wineglass  i know you think me very strange said she after a pause which he had hardly known how to break and the symptoms of an outbreak became more and more evident but she struggled with her impulse for a moment dont make a commonplace civil answer she said4 or i shall have no patience with you i know your thoughts you are sitting there despising me as hard as you can dont tell me   a phrase which the young lady seemed to affect  presently you will go away and as you light your cigar in the street you will smile and sny4 queer girl thatsomething wrong and tomorrow you will sit down and write to miss and tell your dearest love that you went out to supper and met the oddest sort of girl with her dress off her shoulders and black hair not altogether ugly but cracked you believe  and then you will make a sketch of me for misss amusement and assure her that she has no cause for jealousy i knowdonttellme  and she almost gasped bernard compassionately took her hand a very soft and warm one and she looked up quite piteously 44 say you will not write that in your letter said mary in the most earnest and petitioning way 44 certainly if you wish it said bernard not exactly knowing what else to say 44 o t do i do so much she replied sobbing 44 will you promise it will you pledge yourself to it there i am sure you will andand it was so evident that she meant to be kissed hy way of confirmation of the promise that there was really no appeal and though of course bernard under existing circumstances most reluctantly approached her lips he did touch them and whether she hod bent too forward in her kneeling position or however else it might happen a cloud of black curls fell upon his cheek and mary maynard into his arms he could hardly look up for a moment or so but as her curls fell back from his face he did and met another gaze which is the white hermitage young carlyon said mr heywood 4 ah this i think he added quietly filling his glass there is something in all this which reminds us painfully of eugenes sues pictures of high life in paris it is strangely unpleasing to our english taste this mrs forester thus acting a part unfit to name an unprincipled gambler the harbourer and cruel taskmistress of poor mary maynard an unscrupulous tool of the jesuit heywood afterwards employed by him in a still more disreputable work marries and without any reformation on her part the highminded pious selwyn and is chosen by bernard carlyon to present at court his pureminded wife  surely mr brooks must see the gross indelicacy of all this the man who draws such bewitching characters of women as jane wilmslow little amy and the lofty lilian cannot be utterly insensible to all the finer feelings the chapter describing the incarceration of the wilmslows girls by lord rookbury in his house at rookton woods is certainly as exciting as a chapter in monte christo but even more improbable the second title of this book is 44 a story of our own time we cannot quite believe in the existence nowadays in england of such wonderful mechanical contrivances to prevent escape to facilitate eavesdropping and to convert the drawingrooms of a countryhouse into a sensuous oriental harem as are described as part of the household furniture of the earl of rookbury such startling improbabilities not to say anachronisms greatly mar the effectiveness of the book as a description of modern manners it is more pleasing to read such a scene as this full of truth and tenderness where the two hard men of the world exchange a few words of honest sympathy and sorrow for the poor mother about to lose her darling child  441 hope nothing is seriously the matter with poor little amy 441 fear said lord rookbuiy4 that the poor child is not long for this world what amy exclaimed bernard much shocked 44that sunshiny little face he stopped to hear more 44 a cloud has como over that sunshine said the karl in a tone of real feeling  and i doubt whether a darker shadow be not approaching faster than is believed at aspen court i have seen some sad business in my time carlyon he continued 44 and there is not much that i need a physician should tell me but a physioian will have to tell a cruel story to poor dear mrs wilmslow before long 44 it will kill her said carlyon in a low voice 44 she is the best mother in the world and is devoted to all the girls but little amy she idolizes 44 and i will tell you why said lord kook bury once more speaking in the calm voice of ono who analyses a subject but without sympathy 4l that child was born just os the dream that henry wilmslow was anything but a selfish profligate came to an end amy is the link between her mothers happiness and her desolation that link is about to be broken but mrs wilmslow has too strong a sense of duty to let her heart break with sorrow carlyon listened with much surprise as lord rookbury uttered these sentences bernard had never heard him give so much proof that he coidd appreciate a womans nature or her goodness that evil old man who had walked in his reckless way over the worlds best gardens he had then sometimes owned the beauty of the flowers he had snatched and cast away more often perhaps than the younger man imagined carlyon accordingly takes down a great london doctor who having seen amy pronounces her to be dying rapidly the cowardly cur her father listening behind a curtain hears the sad statement without sorrow but with rage at his not being taken into their confidence and determined that the awful news shall not be broken gently to his poor wife rushes into the garden whither the gentlemen had gone to seek her and tells the terrible truth in his own vicious way amy had sat down upon a gardenseat then kate to bernards surprise laid her hand on his arm and made a gesture that she must speak to him apart they proceeded a few steps from the rest of the party 41 there is no time for more than one word is that a doctor and is amy dying 44 yes said bernard her hand clutched upon his arm and he felt her tremble violently but she mastered her agitation and said in a hasty and imploring voice  tell mamma you tell her for gods sakenow bernard guessed all sprang to mrs wilmslows side and made an imperative sign to rockbrook unperceived by her that he must instantly make his communication the readywitted physician understood him and without comprehending the emergency of the case offered his arm to his hostess with a request that she would permit him to say a word or two jane gentle as ever took his arm though with some surprise but they had scarcely turned from the others when a strong hand was laid upon her shoulder aud her husband stood among them he was excited by liquor but in the perfect possession of his faculties and hi face bloated by low debauchery bore a savage expression which as it seemed to carlyon at the moment would have justified him iu felliug wilmslow to the ground 44 ah  im in time i see he said as jane in her habitual effort to screen her husbands vices forced a smile and tried to frame some playful words to help him to excuse his rudeness the smile told him that she had not heard the fatal news 44 one word with you mr wilmslow said carlyon dashing in as a last chance for he saw henrys intention u i havo a message to you from lord liookbury just como and hear ita secret from the ladies 44 indeed returned wilmslow looking at him with on insolent scowl 441 ll hear it at my leisure mr soqretury carlyon sir what 1 have to say is what this gentleman says that a mother ought to hear from her husband i believe those were your words sir i was afraid that my daughter might have forestalled me 44 take her away said bernard to rockbrook 44 at your peril sir shouted wilmslow seizing his wife by the arm  i have only to inform you mrs wilmslow he said in a drawling malicious voice 44 that this gentleman is a london doctor brought down by th at gentleman to seo your youngest daughter and his report is that she is dying and cant live two months all eyes turned to seek amy who retained her seat at the foot of the old tree but the mother was the first to clasp her in her arms 441 knew it said amy quietly 441 thought you all knew it oh yes i am dying i from that day wilmslow is a doomed man molesworth and carlyon who never forgive pursue the wretch to his merited destruction the reason given for molesworth having brought about the wretched marriage between the brute wilmslow and the gentle jane tracy again reminds us of eugene sue that a man disappointed in winning for himself a woman whom he loves with the strong passions of his energetic nature should plot to consign her to the arms of a sot a villain aud a fool in order that she might never respect her husband or love him is too melodramatic a piece of absurdity for our sober english taste there is an excellent description of a debate in the house of commons from which we extract the following spirited sketch  he was hardly down whon one of the staunchest buders of the opposition stood at the red box on the other bide he confronted the ministers boldly as became the fearless and honest commoner lord of half a county and with a pedigree few lords can show lacking the practised composure of the minister he grew excited even with the game in his own hands and the broad hale face reddened up to the roots of the silver hair a fine kindly old man that county member and one who would far gladlier have led the whole house after one of his foxes than have hounded them on to tear down u minister but he thought ho saw duty and it had boen a wuy with the men of his blood for eight hundred years to do it the house rang again with his lusty old voice as he denounced the bad measure and the worse cabinet and moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months the speakers eye fell right and left with extreme impartiality now calling up an energetic barrister bent on a solicitorgeneralship and now a wealthy shipowner strong in wellapplied sense stronger in illapplied aspirates a professional orator delivered his prepared harangueit did not lit very well being un answer to what had not been said but was otherwise unexceptionable  and another gentleman primed with champagne let off a  smart speech which he had got ready for a previous night but had not been able to make  hie jokes missed fire certainly but so they would have done at any other time ireland pronounced against the minister and again enlivened the scene by another littlo internicene war in which munster scoffed mightily at and was scoffed at mightily by connaught the night wore and though great guns roared not timid cries of  divide  broke out as two or three bores successively rose watching his opportunity and springing up after the very stupidest of these in order that ho might snatch and mangle him by way of an opening compliment to the house which tolerates bores wonderfully but rejoices to see them tortured the great leader of opposition stood in the battle a perfect and accomplished debater calmest when apparently stormiest with a studied tone for every taunt and a practised gesture for every jibe his shaft missed no mark his arm struck no blow short he appealed to ancient principles to historic names to the honourable traditions of party to the proud clements of the constitution and he urged in accents alternately sonorous and bitter that for an old principle the advisers of though crown had substituted a manchestermade expediency that they read history backwards as witches read prayers and with though same desirethat of raising a destructive fiend that they had abandoned party traditions for disgraceful hucksterings and that if they had hitherto abstained from destroying thc constitution it was chiefly because they had hoped to make a better bargain by selling it with these and few other gentle imputations delivered in the most masterly and artistic style of which oratory is capable and with a glowing eulogium upon the party with which the speaker was advancing to save the country he concluded one of those dashing and deadly philippics which are a feature in parliamentary history lilian is a charming heroine but bernard carlyon though least loveable of heroes we were at first puzzled to account for our repulsion to this young man he is brave generous and openhanded courteous to womenthe qualities these of a true hero some of the qualities granted but not all there is no sympathy in his character no tenderness no enthusiasm he is cold worldly and calculating we are never led to suppose that he cares for politics or party of a sudden we find him the active energetic assistant of a secretary of state to whom he has been consigned and wc cannot help thinking that he is a mere political swiss who would serve a secretary of state of the opposite party just as strenuously if his doing so would advance his prospects sceptical in all things trusting in nothing but his own hard sense and unflinching boldness his very love for lilian trevelyan savours less of tender passion than of a tierce resolve to win what such clover schemers as lord rookbury mr molesworth afterwards and for no earthly purpose discovered to be his father and mr heywood his priestlyrival are equally determined to withhold from him such a man may be very clever very successful  but he will never bo much beloved even in real life and is by no means a good hero for a novel we like a man of tnier principle higher purpose and more generous impulses to be the winner of womans love and the sharer of our own sympathies we take leave of 4 aspen court with mingled regret and hope regret that mr brooks should have written no better a book with hope that his next work will be more genial in its tone less improbable in its plot and more refined in its descriptions of life and manners a book sad and beautiful and true as life itself wonderful and mysterious is the power which we denominate genius an artist with a soul for beauty and an eye for colour with welltrained taste and scholarly mind studies at rome drinks in inspiration at the hague and at dresden wanders entranced through the louvre and comes back to beniers street with matured judgment honest enthusiasm and mighty ambition only to throw away his pencil in despair and to kick down his easel with disappointment he loves his art intensely ho worships it passionately he understands it thoroughly but beyond this is a barrier which it has not been given him to overpass scholarship poetry taste study are there but the power which wo call genius has been withheld anon a young girl who has studied little in comparison and who has had none of his opportunities in a week or two with a few touches produces a picture before which he kneels with though honest homage of an unselfish worshipper and in whose work he recognises the magic power which he may never attain save in a dream why is this why when two artists draw portraits of living men and women and children is the one only a lawrence while the other is a reynolds  both paint likenesses as leonardo da vinci and benjam  simplicity and fascination or guardians and wards by anne beale 3 vols bentley the only foolish thing in this novel is its title which is certainly enough to deter any but an adventurous reader from its pages  those who begin will however find their virtue rewarded by as pleasant a novel as they would wish to read on a winters day it is a welldrawn picture of english domestic life the characters are well contrasted and the situations and incidents are interesting aunt betsy and uncle timothy are our favourites jessie the mothersister to her family is charmingwhich is saying no little for a model heroine the book ends happily which is always pleasant and a misanthrope must have hopes of a world where so many happy marriages can take root and flourish there areas many couples as in an english countrydance and although the figure is a little complicated yet the right partners find each other at last and everybody marries precisely the right person if the candid reader had been consulted ever so much he could not have arranged matters more to the contentment of everybody

  the traitors by e phillips oppenheim ward lock  co there is something eminently satisfactory about mr oppenheim as a novelist for he knows exactly what sort of a story he has to tell and he knows how to tell it he has at his command an abundance of fine sensational matter and as he uses it with a strict and skilful regard for the best entertainment of his readers his romances are usually effective it is hardly an exaggeration to say of  the traitors  that its interest begins on the first page and continues to the last the plot is ingenious and well managed the movement of the story is admiralty swift and smooth and the characters though by no means deep or complicated are at all events exceedingly vivacious the tale is pseudohistorical and thus obtains that glamour which hangs about great events and high personages of uncertain identity its scene of action is theos  a country which we suspect is situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of buritaniaand what with a revolution the recall of an exiled king a war with turkey and various political intrigues of a dramatic nature the readers excitement is kept on the stretch to the very end,northamerica

the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn novels c by henry kingsley 3 vols macmillan  cothere is a strange family likeness pervading the novels of the two messrs kingsleycharles and henry both affectthe former may claim the honour of having inventedwhat is called  muscular christianity in both the ideal of goodness is intimately associated with a sound digestion strong nerves high spirits and a large development of the animal powers not only the mens sana but the anima pura must be lodged  in corpore sano for real pietywe refer chiefly though not entirely to the sterner sexto be dyspeptic is difficult to be  larmoyant would be impossible the characteristics are utterly incongruous charity indeed forbids them to lay down as a broad principle that no true christian can be subject to neuralgia or afraid of bronchitis or weak on his pins or less than four feet ten inches in stature or too feeble to fight the blacksmith and too timid to shoot a robber but the best that can be said for suchjfrail brethren is that appearances are strongly against them according to the kingsley theory the perfect christian should be recognizable if exhumed a thousand years hence by some theological cuvier of the thirtieth century by the size of his skeleton and the magnificent expansion of his os frontis living in our own day this species may be known chiefly by their vigorous vitality their endurance of fatigue the inextinguishable laughter with which they greet every crisis of suffering or adversity and the stalwart strength1 which upon adequate provocation they can impart to the extensor muscles of the forearm written upon these principles the romances of either kingsley are full of excitement and interest their heroes are apt to display all manner of feats of personal prowess and of course find innumerable opportunities for such performances the author of  geoffrey hamlyna younger brother we believe of the rector of eldertonnow makes his first appearance as the writer of an independent work hitherto his productions have been limited to a few u spirited  articles in frasers magazine describing the sporting capabilities of australia his present work relates chiefly to the same country with which mr h kingsley is evidently well acquainted and concerning which he has much that is at once novel and interesting to tell the family theory indeed prospers amazingly by emigration to a new country in our old and hotpressed society at home we are forced to confess that  muscular christianity  is somewhat out of place it is not altogether true and might occasionally be found inconvenient a muscular christian of the kingsley type would sometimes under contingencies that must now and then occur in england find himself entangled in rather disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by heury kings ley 3 vols macmillan and co mr henry kingsley follows with much vigour his brothers lead and iu the school of muscular christianity which his brother has founded he may prove better claim upon the rank of a head master than that of founders kin the author of geoffrey hamlyn not only talks about life in australis but knows it and as this field of exertion occupies a large place in the ethical system he is helping to develope bia australian experience is worth a doctorate to the new teacher there are four stalwart lovers of a wayward heroine who marries unwisely and at last finds herself an orphan with an infant at the breast her husband a transported coiner he was transported by the judge to a place where he became captain of a gang of bushrangers killed his own son snd wss hung most of the other persons of ths story are transported also by the author to australia there it may be that the compactness of the plot suffers a little from the full and fresh impression of the

good grass again we ought to start and get some store cattle mr henry kingsley hints sn intention to write more the public will be glad to read more for his power evidently is not of a kind to be exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the artificial precincts of three volumes post 8vo no matter who or what the interlocutors may be mr henry kingsley however has written a book which the public will be more inclined to read than to criticize and we commend them to each other,northamerica

the harvest moon by j s fletcher eveleigh nash our author again lays the scene of his tale in yorkshire but there is no such delightful delineation as in his  mr poskitt though the heroine who widens and deepens her sympathies through tribulation is finely drawn the tale shows life in one of its most unsatisfactory aspects the heroine in dawning womanhood with all the latent powers of her being stirring within her is deliberately left by her father who believes in her purity but ignores her womanhood in a farmhouse with no other companion than a handsome young painter of undoubted talent and great ambition immediately after the painter is called away and apparently henceforward forgets her existence until their next meeting at the deathbed of their son meanwhile the woman has consoled herself with her child the story is told with delicacy but a false note is struck at the reunion of the parents  and we are left wondering if the future career of the reunited couple 9 would be anything but tragedy the minor characters  including a country doctor who patiently loves the heroine with slowly dying hope of reward and his housemate and helpmate sister also a pathetic figure of an old belgian schoolmasterare remarkably well done and add greatly to the other claims of the book on the attention of the public  the hawest moon fiction by j s fletcher eveleigh nash 6s those readers who know mr j s fletcher mainly as a brilliant and sympathetic interpreter of yorkshire life will hardly recognise him in his new novel in  the harvest moon  he has ventured on alien ground for the  enchanting north  plays but a subsidiary part in these pages the story however opens in yorkshire adrien darrell a young painter is touring the northern counties in quest of local colour an accident brings him to the farmstead of cornelius van de linde but it is less an accident than the inevitable workings of destiny that makes him fall in love with corneliuss pretty daughter mr fletcher is at his best in these earlier chapters he has succeeded in investing his narrative with the atmosphere of an english country house and there is an enchanting idyllic quality in those scenes which record the lovemaking of adrian and linda the idyll quickly disappears however to give place to tragedy and with the death of cornelius and the seduction of linda we enter upon a more gloomy phase of the narrative linda is left desolate expecting the birth of her child she leaves england and seeks sanctuary in bruges waiting and waiting in vain for the return of her absent lover meanwhile her life centres in her boy whom she cherishes with a fierce affection that is perhaps not far removed from selfishness the boy inherits the artistic instincts of his father and at the request of a visitor to bruges himself a famous artist he is sent to rome to complete his education linda quickly follows to find that the boy has just been killed in an accident she meets the man who has befriended him who is none other than the lover by whom she has been so cruelly betrayed there follows a flight from rome and a succession of months in which linda is learning the harctlesson of selfrenunciation and selfforgetfulness ultimately harmony is restored from so many discordant elements and the book closes on a scene of happiness and reunited affection the quality of the writing is excellent throughout and mr fletcher has been particularly happy in his delineation of the minor characters monsieur verbecke in particular a quaint but altogether lovable blend of the ecclesiastic and the pedant is a triumph of portraiture but the chief interest of the story lies with linda and it is for this masterly presentation of the development of a soul that mr fletchers book deserves the highest praise,northamerica
  eassan a fellah a romance of palestine by henry gillman gay  bird this is an artless tale of the love of hassan a stalwart young peasant of a village near jerusalem and ililwe a maid of a hostile hamlet though there is little attempt at construction the characters are natural and the simple love story is true to the feeling of the east mr gillman was american consul at jerusalem during the cleveland government and he evidently studied the people closely and picked up some arabic he has used this knowledge remorselessly the worst of  local colour  is that the possessor of the secret is always too prodigal a novel ought not to be a vehicle for folklore but the jerusalem consul is so enamoured of his scene that he paints it religiously in minute detail and will not suffer a feature to be blurred in the interests of art not content with weaving round his slender tale a variegated envelope of manners and customs formulas of speech proverbs religious ideas and biblical parallels he intersperses his narrative with personal reflections ejaculations and apostrophes exceedingly disconcerting to the most sympathetic reader nearly six hundred closely printed pages replete with local colour take a great deal of enthusiasm to digest especially when the anthropology reads like this as she bared the soft hemisphere of her argent breast to her boy the sacred fountain of his nutriment gave not forth as abundantly as usual nor as freely as he desired the sweet supply when the wicked aga of the zaptiahs tumbles down a precipice the righteous satisfaction of the reader is abruptly checked by the scientific result for his late accession of avoirdupois had not helped to meliorate the force of the concussion mr gillman believes that the american peoplehe means the population of the united statesare restive under anything approaching sentimentality the useless or effete what they will make of his story is a curious speculation  but to judge from some notorious successes there is little reason to fear that either his sentimentality or his magniloquence will in j ure the circulation of his novel with the masses of his fellowcountrymen among whom the critical faculty is yet in its infancy  hassan a fellah however would not be unreadable if it were reduced to a quarter of its present avoirdupois there are some pretty eastern sketches in it both of people and places,northamerica

  overshadowed l the shorter poems of frederick tennyson macmillan and co it is probable that few people know the name of frederick tennyson save from the chance connexion of relationship to the great poet laureate for all that he was a poet of no mean ability who but for the eclipsing glory of his brother might conceivably have made a name conspicuous in the history of victorian literature he had unfortunately too retiring a disposition a nature too fond of abstract study and a soul that loved and sought for seclusion such ideals were hardly the right weapons for a fight necessary to make the dense understand the separate identities of his brother and himself and frederick tennyson never tried to do more than please his friends with the poems that were to him one of the easiest methods of expression with no wish for a public reputation the poet did not restrain himself sufficiently ever to get it in his constant use of capitals which to him doubtless conveyed an extra interpretation and significant reality in his vagueness and diffuseness of expression and the frequent antitheses he employed may be traced without especial difficulty the fondness for the abstract that can never make frederick tennyson really popular with any except those who look for poetry to convey to them something beyond a simple story with a moral or a motto and a sweet sense of emotional music frederick tennyson very often does tell a simple story and he very often uses exceedingly sweet lines but in general his style is very different examine a verse from a poem entitled the mountain so from the faroff mount of poesy the worlds great shows like the hushd champaign seem the actual insubstantiality real what is shaped in fancys eager eye fear love a hope a dream it is doubtful if any but real poets will appreciate this stanza with its harshness in places and abstractness of philosophical ideas but there are times when frederick can become as philosophical and as musical as browning take for example these two lines with all the great dreams that lie behind all the possibilities of eternity and all the conceptions that hover behind space climbing into the awful infinite those stairs whose steps are worlds very roughly indeed this is the main trend of ideas that run through this book for we must admit that frequently the theme is monotonous and the poet reiterates in a different manner what he has already expressed it must be understood however that though there are many faults of style and execution in the craft of the poetry yet in itself the poems are those which only one who had soared above the realms of minor poetry could have written,northamerica

against wind and tide by holme lee author of sylvan holta daughter1 c 8 vols smith elder and co thia it one of the few good novels that deserve perms nent life in a cheap edition the author has already produced works not merely of promise but of mark and this ia the best of them it is the story of two illegitimate sons of a rich baronet of whom one quits his mother to enjoy life in luxury under bia fathers protection but the other abides by his mothertill her death and then becomes a tradesman the aame blot is on the life of both each of the brothers has to make hie way under different conditions against wind and tide there is a wide canvas spread therefore for the novelist and abe bas filled it not only gracefully but in a way that shows her power  ajaind wind and tide new novell or op by holme lee 3 er vols smith elder  cowe prefer thib novel to any of the authors previous onesit bears marks of more matured talent thc story is interesting though characters are well designed though not all of them carried out with equal success the ethics and morality are free from the morbid tendency to make misery by exaggerating a secondary point of duty and selfsacrifice at the expense of common sense and common justiceindeed to slaughter all other virtues to show greater honour to the selected onea mode of proceeding against which we have often protested in the present novel the just proportions of things to each other is preserved which much increases the pleasure of the reader the love of strong contrasts the magnifying of one quality to the starving and dwarfing of all others is a snare to young authors who think thereby to obtain strong situations and powerful effects holme lee has learned better we have met with few things superior to the account of margaret hawthorne sitting on the fallen tree in the dim twilight praying to be delivered from evil and kept from temptation knowing that the man who had cruelly and dishonourably wronged her by an illegal marriage had come back and was as she believed seeking her presence but not knowing that he had returned a free man with the design of  atoning for past wrong and winning present happiness by marrying her truly not knowing that even then he was standing close beside her although unperceived by her  finding instead of the beauty and the grace he remembered a woman separated from him in state aud station by ten long years of almost menial worka woman older than lier age thin to emaciation sorrowful almost to apathy lie was touched but he was repelled and he goes away without saying a wordonly he sends a message through the clergyman offering to take the children and bring them up in his own sphere one of them goes the other they are twinbrothers refuses and remains with his mother margaret hawthorne delivered from the hope and fear which had gnawed her life dies quietly and without complaint fading out of life and out of the story her work being done margaret hawthorne has nothing to do with the afterstory though it takes its root in her life and death there is nothing in the rest of the book that comes near this short episode for simple tragical led  pathos and quiet restrained power there is no strong colouring very few epithets the incidents are indicated and shadowed out rather than detailedbut they are true to the life and death  the reader is touched with a pity deeper than words or tears can speak it the remainder of the story is taken up with the history of the career of the two brothers cyrus goes to his father and becomes a fine gentleman and a genius  he chafes against his bar sinister and resents the inconveniences of his own position fancying he is feeling his mothers wrongs it is not an interesting character nor very skilfully drawn it is composed of qualities which are laid on from the outside cyrus is not a living haman being and the reader wearies of him robert his brother is more successful but he too is made in mosaic of good qualities contrasting with those which make up his brother neither of them is more than an automaton constructed with pains and ingenuity some of the incidental characters are more successful lady leigh the benefactress of orphans is good  dorothea sancton is a charming sketch  for holme lee succeeds better in indicating character than in working out fulllength studies the descriptions of natural scenery are done with evident love and feeling for outofdoor nature only they are too numerous and too elaborate but the book as a whole is of a good quality and will deservedly add to though reputation holme lee has already acquired  against wind and tide novels by holme lee 3 vols smith  eldertbe expectations raised by  sylvan holts daughter mo amply fulfilled by the authoress in this new production in many respects indeed the present novel exhibits a marked improvement over her former work the style without any sacrifice of simplicity is richer and firmer while the characters are sketched with a more free and vigorous touch the plot of  against wind and tide is original and bold a wealthy baronet sir philip nugent betrays the pretty daughter of simon hawthorne a farmer residing in the isle of wight by a false marriage as the former lady nugent is still living the offence is not only one of deception but felony on discovering the trick the victim abandons her betrayer and flies back to her father with whom she resides for the rest of her life which is only prolonged sufficiently to enable her to bring up the two sons who were the off spring of her illstarred union until the lads had grown almost to the verge of manhood shortly before this sir philip reappears  his wife is dead and he at last enjoys an opportunity to repair so far as reparation is possible the cruel wrong he had inflicted this however he has not the grace to do but tries to compound the matter with his conscience by offering to make liberal provision for the boys one of them cyrus being gifted with a poetical which means an impulsive and selfish temperament accepts the offer and quits his mothers side to plunge amidst the pleasures of the great world under his fathers protection his brother robert remains at home and when mary hawthorne dies fulfils his original plan of entering the establishment of an uncle who carries on an extensive business as manufacturer of varnish in a large provincial town both of the brothers are however brought into situations where the social consequences of their false position and equivocal parentage come into play the shadow of the bar sinister rests on both and its effects upon their respective characters and careers is depicted with unusual fidelity and power it is indeed this struggle carried on under such very different conditions of circumstance and character against a  false position which forms the staple of the story in the end robert becomes head of the varnishmaking establishment and enjoys a fair allowance of domestic felicity cyrus passes through many vicissitudes of passion fame and fortune he writes poems which confer on him a brief popularity wins the love of a young lady whom his own father snatches from him by making her the second lady nugent commits diverse escapades gets terribly and ruinously into debt breaks with sir philip and comes to london to make his own way as poet journalist or miscellaneous adventurer in relating this portion of her heros career and especially when delineating the characteristics and habitudes of the very peculiar class whom mr wbitty has denominated  friends in bohemia the authoress has shown a keener and truer insight into the subject than almost any of those predecessors who have ventured upon the same tempting but slippery path ultimately cyrus also becomes rich and happy after narrowly escaping death by starvation in a london garret he inherits all bis fathers unentailed property and nunies of course the lady who has been safely educating for that distinguished position all along sir philip himself is perhaps if moral considerations alone prevailed let off much too easily he is a thorough and selfish villain but is allowed to enjoy a long and prosperous life chequered only by a few compunctions and an awkward dilemma or two but as moral justice or what we think such seldom rules the destinies of humanity in real life we must not complain if it is sometimes omitted from the artistic presentments of ideal life by the novelist in every respect  against wind and tide deserves to command not merely the brief popularity assigned to

thc good time coming by tsarthur hodg sonthis is a good and useful story but told in a style of mawkish sentimentalism which would always be in bad taste but it bas also gone by as completely as the shepherd and shepherdess figures of speech in which our greatgrandmothersall hoops and whaleboneespecially delighted the moral of the good time is very well brought out and in spite of the style the story deserves to be read  a good time coming by the author of mathew paxton 3 vols hurst and blackett this is a hearty lancashire tale of men and masters not only of a good time coming but at last also of a good time come  and of the energy and kindliness of common feeling that learned how they could live the bad times down and get prosperity out of adversity good out of evil the author understands lancashire life and appears sometimes to hover about existing things and people it was impossible perhaps to be in earnest and not do so,northamerica
cease firg by mary johnston 6s constable taken by itself miss mary johnstons new novel  cease firing may seem a ragged piece of work it is likely at times to perplex a reader unacquainted with the authors last book and some misunderstanding would we think have been prevented if the new volume had been plainly put forward as a continuation of  the long roll it is really the second part of a trilogy which is not yet completed slowly and carefully miss johnston is composing a great panorama of the american civil war taken from an unusual point of view a daughter of the south descended from a famous fighting stock she writes with intense and yet restrained partisanship nevertheless she treats the north with the courteous fairness becoming in a virginian of the old school but sadly lacking in the multitude of modern american novelists who take the popular triumphant side in some respects she is rather more of an historian than a novelist in the fine and important work on which she is now engaged the story in  cease firing  is a mere thread which scarcely connects together all the chapters of the book what miss johnston aims at depicting and succeeds in depicting is the whole life of a dying nation for the south was a nation distinct from the north in manners spirit and tradition and this distinction was the fundamental cause of the civil war properly handled the slavery question might have been settled without an armed conflict for a majority of the planters was inclined to some pacific scheme of emancipation but between the industrial democratic northerners and the agricultural gentry of the south there was a division as deep as that which once separated our puritans and cavaliers  free government says one of the characters in cease firing is founded on the consent of the governed and every community strong enough to establish and maintain its independence has a right to assert it my father fought great britain in defence of that principle but being behind the north in industrial power the planters were at last defeated and broken and it is as a tragic picture of a highspirited people in their day of irretrievable disaster that miss johnstons new work fills and touches the mind it is not an historical novel built from books and deriving all its animating power from the writers imagination the author has woven her fine work out of the living memories of her relatives and friends of the older generation the result is a peculiar vividness of treatment the whole struggle of the south is seen in so intimate a way that the living fighting desperate nation becomes the real hero and the individual figures count for what they represent more than for what they singly are the characterization is always clear and interesting but it is merged in the larger subject,northamerica
caleb west master diver by f hopkinoua smith 6s a conmtable sad co there is a frank naturalness about this story which we have found particularly attractive the characters are thoroughly human they speak and act like living people and secure the mr f hopiunson smith readers friendship from the first caleb west is a strong ad interesting character but there is a burlychested bighearted old seadog known as captain joe whom we prefer even to the diver there is something invigorating and refreshing in the briny atmosphere which he brings with him everywhere the young civil engineer too is an entirely satisfactory type of man clever sensible and honestly human a capital busneas man where lighthouse building is concerned a loyal and honourable gentleman in his friendship with mrs leroy in fact all the characters are good the details of engineering work are interesting the style is bzight and effective the writer is to be congratulated on his work  caleb west master diver by f hopkinson smith constable  cothis is a very typical american novel of the kind which is not by one of the few firstrate writers on the other side it shows a society full of young enthusiasms always eager to resolve fresh problems and looking on life as something new requiring investigation and not yet cut and dried these characteristics are what generally make even the worst american novel worth looking at as it may suggest some original way of looking at life but these novels have also the inevitable fault of a youthful literary societys work  they have little style and little sense of proportion the author is apt to be so interested in his own ideas that he forgets to rivet his readers attention by the unity of his story now caleb west is by no means a bad novel it is full of interesting matter and it has a subtlety of observation and a delicacy in characterdrawing rarely found in any but the best english novels  but as a consecutive story it is hopeless the account of the building of the lighthouse is most interesting even exciting but it has no more real connexion with calebs love tragedy or mrs leroys fine character than the account of a gold mine or a savage raid would have mrs leroy is indeed disappointing dramatically there is just enough of her tragedy outlined to attract intensely without satisfying the reader  the suggestiveness of it is so subtle as to be elusive nevertheless  caleb west is an interesting book and if the author would study form more he could write excellent novels  caleb west master diver by f hopkinson smith constable  co one seems to seo though evolution of this story very plainly though author is a culturod amiablo gentleman with literary tastes and some skill let me seo what shall my novol be about he asked himself  technical fiction is popular kiplings captains courageous pleased people a good deal ill bo technical too lighthouse building hasnt been done ill do that a description of how foundationstones are laid under though water should go well and for human interest well givo the diver a young wife who shall elope with one of the workmen and the chief engineer shall have artistic tastes and be loved by a new york society woman and it was done and the result is an agreeable and utterly unimportant story and we hope that the author does not talk about the inevitableness of his art hero is a passage   these breathing spells rest the lungs of a diver and lighten his work being at rest he can manage his dress the better inflating it so that he is able to get his air with greater ease and regularity the relief is sometimes so soothing that in long waits the droning of the airvalve will lull the diver into a sleep from which he is suddenly awakened by a quick jerk on his wrist many divers while waiting for the movements of those above play with the fish watch the crabs or rake over the gravel in search of the thousand and one things that are lost overboard and that everybody hopes to find on the bottom of the sea caleb did none of these things he was too expert a diver to allow himself to go to sleep and he had too much to think about to play with the fish he sat quietly awaiting his call his thoughts onthe day of the week and how long it would bo before saturday night came again and whether when he left that morning he had arranged everything for the little wife so that she would bo comfortable until his return once a lobster moved slowly up and nipped his red fingers with its claw thinking them some tidbit previously unknown the dress terminates at though wrist with a waterproof and airtight band leaving the hands bare at another time two tomcods came sailing past side by side flapped their tails on his helmet and scampered off but caleb sitting comfortably on his sofacushion of seaweed thirty feet under water paid little heed to outside things his eyes only saw a tossing apron and a trim little figure on a cabin porch as she waved him a labt goodbye according to the new york bookmans cables caleb west is very popular all over amorica it is a pleasant story enough and people might do much worse than read it but it is machine made from first pago to last it is not fit to be mentioned in the same week with mr smiths earlier work colonel carter of cartersville that had character,northamerica
  fiction love in old cloathes and other stories by h c bunner downey  co this is a pleasingly illustrated collection of stories chiefly in the light comedy vein full of the little sentimentalities and prettinesses which characterise one kind of transatlantic fiction the late mr bunner was always a deviser of quaint expedients and the tale which gives its title to the book is a piece of modern lovemaking done in the style of pepys it says much for the authors skill that the result is successful for we hpve found the archaic rendering of slang infinitely amusing in french for a fortnight  a sabbatarian clergyman is betrayed into joining a sunday fete of french new yorkers and there and then repents of his  narrowness  the chromatic uncle is a pleasant sketch of an older new england  fend the uncle himself who was no uncle after all but only a certain tommy biggs is a character worth knowing on the whole we prefer mr bunner in his lighter moods r but one at least of his graver stories  has high merit crazy wifes ship is the tale of a prim old woman who deliberately cuts herself off from her neighbours and the little fashions of the place for the purpose of preventing her daughterinlaw from hearing of her husbands death she is compelled to forego the wearing of mourning in which her soul delighted and take upon herself a reputation for imbecility but when at last the girl dies the old woman crosses to the mainland and returns with sufficient mourning clothes to last her to the end of ufe the story is admirably told the village idiom is racy and expressive and the pathos is all the stronger from the studious reticence the red silk handkerchief  is a variation on the old theme of the lover who for long dreams of his mistress and then is rudely awakened by meeting her on her wedding tour the thing is well enough done in its way but the final scene is so old and stale that it fails to touch our jaded emotions better is a letter and a paragraph a curious forecast of a happy future which a poor and unknown man writes to a friend on the eve of his death last of the seven comes a story of revivalism in the backwoodsthe country of theron ware and his iuuminationwhere  an aged bishop stills the nervous excitement by the repetition of parts of the prayer book somehow the story seems just to miss its due effect and the final picture has awkward suggestions of the comic which spoil its dignity the truth is that bishop waldegrave is too histriohic a figure to convince and his speech savours of the religidus novel of our forefathers we like the author best when he indulges in pure comedy but the whole book is readable and entertaining,northamerica
the child who will never grow old reviews by k douglas king john lane never have we so cordially sympathised j with darwins plea for a law compelling stories to end happily as in reading this book for of the eight tales between its covers all save perhaps one end on a note of unnecessarily poignant pathos miss king is a very herod in the way she insists on the death of the children of her fancy in the first story a little boy dies of a broken back in the second two little boys are run over by a train in the third a boy who is older than is common with mies kings heroes is killed by a drunken man in the fourth one little boy is shot with a gun fired deliberately by another little boy in the fifthbut that is the exception in the sixth a suffering baby is left to die at the workhouse uifirmary in the seventh a little boy falls over a cliff in the eighth a little boy is drowned these calamities are in themselves sorrowful enough but our misery is rendered more acute by the pains which miss king lavishes to endear her heroes to us look for example at tonybaba whose back was broken and whose history gives the title to the book tonybaha drew breath and then resumed in his customary subdued conversational tones  he said to me when id got over and we was looking at each other  my names johnnie jamiesonwhats yours   i said im tonybaba this is my dog bibi and my beauteous cat and he frowned did that johnnie jamieson oh most tremendous and he said quick as quick i can lick you all to fits   lick means beat you in fighting or racing papa  i can lick you all to fits he saidjust that and i said i can lick you  i bet you cant he said  i bet i can just smash you all up  and i said let us try a faint light sparkled in the depths of tonybabas dreamily retrospective eyes  did you try  i asked we did try he jumpted on me and i jumpted on him both together we jumpted and we got ourselves all mixed up then we began to fight and we sighted and tugged and jammed our fistses in each others eyes and we couldnt smash each other nohow we shouldnt have never left off fighting i believe and think ony johnnie caught his foot in a rabbit hole and corned toppling over and me on the top cause all our arms and legs was mixed up together  what happened next  tonybaba drew another long sigh of satisfaction  it was all quick as quick papa he said  and johnnie sort of pulled me down but i remembered just in time that it wasnt no game but that we was fighting on purpose to lick each other all to fits soi tonybaba paused artistically  so you what   i stumped on him with all my weightiest weight when he pulled me and i felled down i just stumped kerrash on top of him as heavy as i could  what did he do   im awful heavy i believe when i fall like that he didnt say no think at all 1 what happened then   we just lay staring at each other and his breathing was loud as loud only he couldnt breathe as loud as he wished to cause i was on t p of him and i was awful out of breath too then he said in a skrushed insidehim sort of voice  well anyhow my papa is bigger and braver nor yours i know  if in these stories miss king had any gift of inevitability we should not mind but she has none death is never the necessary termination of the tale life would serve just as well hence our objection and if she displayed signs of possessing unusual insight into child nature or if there were valuable results of genuine observation we should mind less but again there are none the stories are so obviously pure invention and the endings are so obviously selected because of their nearness to the authors heart that we have a right to protest in a way that we should not protest did the characters or incidents in the least convince us of reality miss king can write deverly and it is plain from the extracts given above that she has humour we beg her to be as pleasing rather than as harrowing as she can,northamerica

the corner in coffee by cyrus townsend brady putnams sons we gather from his own prefatory statements that the author enjoys a considerable vogue in the united states we should not be surprised if he gained one of a sort in england but it will never be a literary vogue in a very conceited preface dated brooklyn new york christmas eve 1903 he displays his methods as a concocter of fiction with elaborate and indecent candour they are methods which have nothing to do with the production of literature and do not commend themselves to our taste the story seems to have been largely derived from the late frank norriss  the pit and is concerned entirely with wall street speculation its good characters are kindly and incredibly vulgar its bad characters are dishonest and unbelievably caddish its sentiment is that of the christmas card its crises those of surreyside melodrama the authors use of language is not adequate he introduces the son of an english peer and makes him talk in this style  now you re a rippin girl ye know and i like you awfully well really i do he drawled most americans seem to think it is rather a jolly thing to be a lordor a lady i meananderthat sort of thing dont you know and iiwant you awfullypon honour i do there is much of this sort in the book which we cannot commend,northamerica

much ado about peter by jean webster 5s net hodder  stoughton peter is the irish groom of a rich american familyan uncommon profession in fiction but as miss webster shows one well worth writing about as one has come to expect from the author of  daddylonglegs the story is one of much freshness sentiment and humour perhaps the title is something of a misnomer for peters adventures are of the mild kind that one associates with domestic service nd being a well broughtup young man he gives nobody any great trouble but it is a very pleasant little book of a kind that american lady writersand miss jean webster in particularare adept in vriting everybody will enjoy an hour or two with peter  much ado about something bv c e lawrence 6s murray we have never before come across a book of this kind but we shall hope to lo so in the future much ado about something is a fairy novel it is not a childrens story in spite of the fact that the author displays gifts of imagination and description that would at once endear him to children it is a very serious book indeed mr lawrence clearly feels that he has a message to delivera message to the people of london in particular even if one does not agree with every one of the changes which the author would like to introduce one can feel nothing but admiration for a book inspired by such a purpose it would be well indeed if london and the world generally could be changel in accordance with mir lawrences wishes but his fairies went the right way about the matterthey changed mens natures no amount of material alteration can make much difference until men are educated up to the point of view of the author of this very remarkable book p much ado about something is the story of the revolt of june against her ruler oberon she is resolved to convert london to the fairies a thing which oberon says is utterly impossible but june who is assisted by her nomefriend bim succeeds and at the end of a year london is a very different place how different and howv june succeeded we leave our readers to discover for themselves all who love daintiness and charm who appreciate a delightful literary style who occasionally think about people other than those in their own particular  set should read this book would that it could come true  l snath b hbi   1 bcacl ai mr c e awycb  with nir l cranuierbyng editor of the succetsfult  wisdom of the east set ies and al a w evans astaiwatetdiwtir of the alitn,northamerica

  dile blazed trail by stewart edward white constable  co a titlepage announcement informs us that a previous work by the author of this interesting story of north american pioneer life was likened to the late bret hartes  luck of roaring camp such comparisons are inevitable it would not be easy for any author to produce a story dealing with simla without learning that it reminded some one of mr kipling in the same way the mention of american pine and balsamic scents infallibly suggests to some minds comparison with bret harte as a fact point of view and method of treatment are sounder bases of comparison than subject or locality and in point of view and treatment mr white does not in the least suggest the author of  the heathen chinee he is far more strenuous and proportionately less humorous more earnestly realistic and less picturesquely romantic and withal he has not as yet at all events attained to anything like bret hartes command of language but the blazed trailis none the less a book to read and it will repay the reader a good deal more generously than the majority of everyday modern novels there was a novel published some few months ago which dealt in a healthily ambitious manner  in a would  be epic manner  with the great wheatgrowing industry of the pacific slope mr white has made a similar and a fairly adequate attempt on behalf of the logging industry or timbergetting in north america both subjects smack of great primaeval interests both have lent themselves to large vigorous treatment by the painter in words  the blazed trail forms very spirited and interesting reading  the blazed trail by stewart edward white mr white is of the pioneer and mining camp school of writers that has just lost its greatest figure in mr bret harte in the story which opens at a logging station in michigan we are concerned with the american pioneer  a strong man with a strong mans virtues ancl a strong mans vices the story lacks nothing of the flavour and excitement promised by its title constable os,northamerica
mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and his only child to explain their views and positions  papa

satirise you dreadfullywell if we are going io live in new boston why cant we keep house  this extract gives a good idea of the pleasant natural style in which the book is written the doctor is a most delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy matters i mst confess sid the doctor resuming his seat that this is a most attractive and flattering proposition i am vain enough to believe that i could be of use to this poor ignorantbrutish downtrodden insulted plundered race of pariahs and helots if i could orgaise negro labour in louisiana on a basis jut and profitable to all partieishould consider myself more honoured than by being made president of the united ates in ordinary times if i could be the means of educating their darkened minds and consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his child how tender is his care for her how devoted his attachment i how pleasant and how playful his manner yet always so full of sympathy and wathful love  he and colbourn the volunteer captain are both made superior to ordinary mortals they can be hardhearted to themselves but they are always tenderhearted to their neighbours the cut the burden of their own troubles and griefs behind their backs that they may sympathies with those of their friends the virtues of the parent ae reflected in his child lmeli is the worthy daughter of such a father the gaiety of her temper is the charucteristic which chiefly charms the reder the personal beauty which exercises so potent a spell over all with whom she has to do cannot really afford any particular pleasure to one who only reads of it beauty must be seen to be appreciated there is but small satisfaction in hearing of a beauty one is never likely to se but as we road we csot help feeling the pleasant hw lp di har iature and

vividly the enn and tediousn of life in camp the restraint of discipline and the frequent negligenes of volunteers the reckless rush of some to the charge whilst others are skulking behind the terrors of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special qualification we have on our table thc epistle

the europeans the europeans  a sketch by henry james jun in two volumes macmillan by his clever essays on french poets and novelists mr henry james has made himself a reputation on this side of the atlantic as well as in his own country if  the europeans does not prove him to have as much skill in writing novels aa in writing essays it leaves the question open though spun out in the english edition into two volumes the europeans  might very well have been printed in one and it is altogether too light in its workmanship to be classed among regular novels superior as it is to most of them it is in fact a daintilywritten aud wellconstructed prose comedy containing very few incidents and some of these being rather preposterous but on the whole giving a lively  sketch as he very fitly calls it of one phase of life and one aspect of character in new england the story is of an enterprising lady the daughter of american parents but born and bred in europe morgauatically married to a jetty german prince whose family is now anxious to divorce him from her amicably and of the adventures that follow from her efforts to fall in with these proposals if she can make it convenient to do so she bears the title of baroness munster and has persuaded her brother a goodnatured bohemian whose name is plain felix young and who has no other occupation than that of a strolling artist and an amiable pleasure seeker in general to go with her from her german home on a visit to their unknown kinsfolk who live somewhere near boston there we meet them in the first chapter and in the chapters that follow we arc entertained with the small confusions and complications occasioned by the arrival of these harmless bohemians in ti new england arcadia whose inmates for some time do not know what to make of them thc head of the family ibo strangers uncle is a mr wentworth a wealthy man and in every way as good as his own gold but so oppressed with the solemnity of life and its duties as to find no room for pleasure in his scheme of existence though at the same time an excellent and indulgent father to his son clifford and his daughters charlotte and gertrude the son as drawn bv mr james is not a very interesting young man  but the daughters are charmine charlotte wentworth is thc martha of the family an ideal martha of modern times looking after cverrbody s comfort and anxious for everybodys happiness anet so unselfish that she does not know she is in love with mr brand the prim young unitarian minister whom sho is anxious to marry to her sister because she thinks the match would bc to her sisters spiritual welfaro and would be a very agreeable arrangement for mr brand himself gertrude wentworth is more visionary and something of an anomaly in this puritan family felix young comes as a revelation to her from the gay outside world about which she has been dreaming all her life and soon persuades her that ho is much more likely than mr brand to make her happy  there must be a thousand different ways of being dreary she says in one of her pretty naive flirtations with felix and sometimes i thinkwe make use of them all  i am trying for once to be natural she says at another time when mr brand is expostulating with her for her innocent levity  i have been pretending all my life why shouldnt i be frivolous if i want  one has a right to be frivolous if its ones nature no i dont care for great questions i care for pleasurefor amusement here is a bit of the last chapter in which the family is discussing whether gertrude shall be allowed to marry felix   havent you confidence in felix gertrude was frowning thero was something about her that her father and charlotte had never seen before charlotte got up and came to her as if to put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid to touch her mr wontworth however was not afraid  i have had moro confidence in felix than in you he said yes you have never had confidence in menever never i dont know why  oh sister sister murmured charlotte you have always needed advice mr wentworth declared you have had a difficult temperament 11 why do you call it difficult it might have been easy if you had allowed it you wouldnt let mo bo natural i dont know what you wanted to make of me       i havo nover seen you so passionate obsorvod mr wentworth with an air of indignation mitigated by high principles  i am sorry if i offend you said gertrude  you offend me but i dont think you are sorry  yes father she is sorry said charlotte i would even go further dear uncle felix interposed i would question whethor she really offends you how can she offend you  to this mr wontworth made no immediate answer then in a moment  she has not profited as wo hoped gertrude was very palo sho stood looking down i have told felix i would go away with him she presently said  go away sister asked charlotte awayaway to some strange country towhat do you call it turning an instant to felix  to bohemia  do you proposo to dispense with preliminaries asked mr wentworth getting up gertrude turned to hor father i tm re profited she said you wanted to form my character well my character is formedfor my age i know what i want i havo chosen i am determined to marry this gentleman what little romance there is in  the europeans  gathers round the baroness and a certain mr acton  but we will not weaken the interest of the story to its readers by detailing this especially as the real merit of the book lies chiefly in its descriptions of gertrude and felix and the matters immediately concerning them these descriptions are fresh delicate and artistic to english readers the europeans will be particularly attractive because of the graceful picture mr janies draws of a condition of society hardly possible in this

  litth women or meg jo beth and amy part second by louisa m alcott low  co tms is a cheerful domestic story which appears to be written for the especial use and behoof of the fair sex as it deals with the gradual development of character which takes place in the four young heroines whose earlier years have been described in a previous work the scene is in the united states and our fair countrywomen will find here portrayed a state of society to which they are utterly unaccustomed although at the same time the book abounds with touches of human nature and traits of character which are common to all the world probably but we speak on such topics with diffidence there is something very lifelike in miss jos confession some time after refusing an offer of marriage that perhaps if teddy had tried again she might have said  yesnot because she loved him any more but because she cared more to be loved than when he went away but teddy has now found elsewhere the haven of rest which jo denied him and jo has to content herself with the gift of an awakened but as yet unsatisfied heart it is almost needless to say that miss jo is one of the strongminded race of young women and that she has started in life with the fallacious idea that a mans love is by no means essential to a womans happiness now she has found out her mistake and deigns to make confession to her mother who congratulates her on her progress in natural feelings tm glad of that jo says the calm but sympathising parent for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward jo takes the advice very kindly but assures her mother that her heart has become so elastic lately that it cannot be properly filled as of yore with family affections i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it says poor jo i do says her mother with a meaning smile this seems all very pretty and sensible and it is a fact we believe that young ladies do sometimes get confidential with their mammas on these subjects when softened by a little disappointment miss jo in her early days aspires to literary success the other sisters one artistic one consumptive and so on follow out their several destinies and most of them get  settled  in due time though not so to speak according to the  first intention there is a good deal of innocent fun in the book and there is no lack of quaint transatlantic expressions and turns of thought she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it you must promise not to cut up any pranksdont be a peacock i only moaned a trifle just to keep the other girls company  i dont wish to get raspy so lets change the subject no wonder that young mr lawrence the hero gives up all thought of jo the individual who doesnt wish to  get raspy and seeks happiness with the gentle amy who vows that she is prouder of her handsome husband than of all his money and addresses him with the tender words  dont laughbut your nose is such a comfort to me  the reader will find more truth and more humour in this story than in many works of fiction of a more pretentious character,northamerica
  wat it bight to forgive by amelia e barr fisher unwin ecno answers  in the affirmative the author has put most forcibly the arguments why adriana filmer nee van hoosen should forgive till seventy times seven her frivolous and unfaithful husband and thereby make a man of him at last it is equally clear that antony van hoosen having a vain wife nee filmer who drags his name in the dirt should also forgive on her realisation of her need of such forgiveness but there is no assumption that the cases are exactly parallel and the writer deals fairly with the physiological grounds of the disparity it must not be thought that the moral in this instance swallows up the tale life in new york and in the village of woodsome is pleasantly realistic the elder van hoosen is a dutchman without guile but with plenty of shrewdness his distant kinsman filmer is a trifle more sardonic he is a bookworm with a pushing wife who is forcing her way into that  smart set which begins to usurp the place of aristocracy on both sides of the sea the figures of adriana and her brother antony are the noble outcome of worldly experience based upon the veracities of a religious home whether calvinism be generally conducive to such an outcome we need not question but peter van hoosen is a good man on account of or in spite of his creed an element not to be neglected in oldworld america,northamerica

the tents of wickedness by miriam coles harris sidney appleton this story may be fairly described as a lineal descendant with modern developments of the novels of e p roe so far as method is concerned the outlook is as ingenuously provincial and the composition of the narrative as artless as in  barriers burnt away and other works from the same pen a theological novel may easily have points of interest provided that the author brings a certain measure of accomplishment to the writing  but 4 the tents of wickedness in spite of several lurid glimpses into their deplorable recesses remains frankly tedious the story is extremely episodic and concerns the fortunes of a fair young girl who fresh from twelve years of convent life is thrown by a careless parent into the vulgar vortex of what appears to be intended for smart society but the outstanding motive of the work is of a sectarian character,northamerica
the mills of the gods and other stories by elizabeth robins 7s net thornton butterworth a tale of revenge brought about after thirty years of waiting is a large subject for a short story but one which elizabeth robins has chosen successfully for the romance which gives the title to this collection against a background of an old rockbuilt castle looking towards italy and the waters of the glacier mill below is set a tragedy far enough removed from modern life to read as a romantic tale madame paravicini plans the marriage of her stepdaughter to renzo belluccisatanuccio his friends call himwho himself is urging on the wedding alicias silence he takes for shyness beauty such as hers is an answer to all questions she is not like others he tells himself in one of the few sincere compliments he has ever paid a woman the marriage takes place and he learns from madames smile that the hour for which she has been waiting has come the pace of the story is quick a short story depends on incident and miss robins understands the art her first interest is always in the tale which she is telling whether of two women in  under his roof one of whom marries the man both love and later finds out her mistake or of old threlkeld hall standing to the wind and the wild northcountry weather and the grim wyrd it works out upon its last child heir characterpainting is given when the canvas will bear it but the lines of necessity are broad the success of the book lies in another directionin the writers sense of the dramatic and in unobtrusive gathering of material with an economy of touch which in a phrase or a sentence pieces together what we need to know of the past,northamerica
the petrie estate by helen d brown osgood mcllvaine  co this is a fairly commonplace story about a lost will which is eventually discovered without any evil consequences to the heroine who loses the property only to gain the hero who acquires it the heroine deserves her wealth as she employs it in improving the slums of new york on the most approved cos principles and what is more remarkable in a novel she does not lose her charm by so doing it is a short story but even so there are several irrelevant characters who might well be spared the chief merit of the bookwhich comes rather as a surprise at the end as the story is throughout told in a somewhat dull unemotional style is a really excellent love scene the author seems distinctly to realise the immensity of true love and quite rises to the occasion 44 there seemed all at once no necessity about anything they were suddenly in possession of all time or rather they were transferred to new space where time was not duty was not words were not this is truly and excellently expressed,northamerica
the days of old lang syne the days of old lang syne  is the complement not the supplement much less the sequel to beside the bonnie brier bush the scene is indeed the same the cast is substantially the old drumtochty onewith however lachlan campbell and donald menzies left out of the action of the piece though evidently looking on lovingly at the wings and ready as wellcoached understudies to rush in and do their best should hillocks or burnbrae or the redoubtable drumsheugh himself break down but the new play is essentially lay and mundane there are in it no seventh heaven raptures transfigurations or sermontastings a second reading of the book has left me in doubt as to whether there is any free kirk or any dissent worth speaking of in drumtochty there is burnbrae to be sure who would rather leave his farm than be disloyal to his disruption creed but even burnbrae   the days of old lang syne by ian macaren london llomer and stoughton 1895 is a man of strong common sense as well as of earnest conviction in another epoch he would probably have fought at irumclog and certainly at dunkeld though i should think not at ayrsmoss he was of the stock of whom burns in spite of his moderatismthe burns by the way of fact not of allan cunninghamwrote 1the solemn league and covenant now brings a smile now brings a tear but sacred freedom too was theirs if thourt a slave indulge thy sneer besides burnbraes battle is fought and wonthe pulverisation of that rather too feeble caricature of claverhouse the english factoris perhaps the best incident in a book full of good incidentsby dr alexander davidson the parish minister who is an old moderate in other words a perfectly  straight but not at all spiritualised layman with a white tie a very stiff upper lip and a soldiers conception of loyalty to duty besides all through  the days of old lang syne hillocks bumbrae soutar drumsheugh and all the rest including even the doctor are thinking less of their ministers texts sermons and experiences than of such completely terrestrial concerns as sales crops leases weather and oldbut not coldloves  beside the bonnie brier bush gave us the firstdayintheweek drumtochty in  the days of old lang syne  we have the parish as it is six days in seven and the most of whose inhabitants are good churchmenor free churchmen as the case may bewhose  religion in common life  finds expression in silent action even more than in family worship it is perhaps because drumtochty in its weekday clothes is more difficult of adequate portraiture than drumtochty in its sunday best that i consider ian maclarens new book a distinct advance on its predecessor i think the transfiguration of donald menzies in  beside the bonnie brier bush  trembles on the verge of unreality and that the holder of the macwhammel scholarship would have been truer to life not to speak of conscience had he preached his new learning sermon semitic environment and allrather than have acted in the possibly beautiful and certainly carlylean way he did even although he thereby pleased his aunt and the spirit of his mother here i find no unrealityalthough there is abundance of what mr arnold in his ignorance of the depths of scottish nature termed  intolerable pathos not even in the little tragedy of the servantgirl who went to london or in the loves of the close drumsheugh and the nippytongued jamie soutar and this makes me hasten to say that while there is almost no spirituality there is a great deal of emotion in  the days of old lang syne that emotion overflows its banks as often as the tochty as a matter of fact ian maclaren while obviouslynever more obviously than in his new booka humourist by nature is a sentimentalist by mission that is to say he has set himself deliberately to lay bare the recesses of simple scottish tenderness and love to oppose these realities to the socalled realism of the rougonmacquart horrors andalas that one should have to say so of the wessex of  jude the obscure and that he has succeeded is beyond doubt in the death of lily grant in  a servant lass  the author is seen at his very bestbetter than in the death of the  lad o pairts which is to me a trifle too  exalted or in the death of maclure which is too long drawn out jamie soutar plays many parts excellently in this book but his intrusion into  a servant lass preventing it from becoming too depressingly sad is perfect ian maclaren is not always it is true up to the mark of  a servant lass drumsheughs lovesecret is too long and too elaborately sustained i for one should have preferred him to remain a consistent curmudgeon to the end instead of turning out a pilgrim of love in disguise but above all things excess of an essentially optimistic sentimentalism has induced him to make the one blunder of his new book to pen the almost maudlin last chapter ian maclaren can in most respects stand comparison with mr barrie but his oor lang hame can only be contrasted and unfavourably for its author with the return of the  son from london  in  a window in thrums which appears to have suggested it the appearance of this son in thrums as a pariah the agonies of his conscience the little touches of neighbourly kindliness which ought to temper the boycotting of him as a moral leper by his old friends but which in reality only add to its pangs his return to london presumably to make a dreary best of it with  the woman who has played the devil with his life these constitute the most awful piece of real for being moral it is real scottish tragedy that has ever been published compared with the return of jamie mcquhumpha to thrums that of chairlie grant to drumtochty to drumsheughs heart andhad that been necessaryto drumsheughs chequebook seems flat and almost poor if ian maclaren is a sentimentalist of set and almost scientific purpose he is a humourist by nature if  beside the bonnie brier bush  indicated this in unmistakable fashion  the days of old lang syne places the fact beyond all question what is more it demonstrates the variety as well as the quality of its authors humour when he keeps it free from emotion as he does entirely in a triumph of diplomacy and almost entirely in  good news from a far country and in the  nippy tongue  section of jamie soutars history he comes nearer to galt than any of his contemporaries mr barrie himself not excepted i have said that a servant lass  is ian maclarens high water mark as yet but for pure and dry but not ungenial drollery there is nothing in this volume or in its predecessor to match hillocks ingenious devices to secure the renewal of his lease on good terms or the successful efforts of the drumtochty worthies to magnify their professor in a far country who happily does not die like 1 omsie jamie soutars hits as at the cockney temperance lecturer and the too confident evangelical preacher are delicious his end is perhaps a trifle overdone and suggests the mendacious captain in  peter simple who affirms with his last gasp that he has known a man live with the deathrattle in his throat for six weeks but it is eminently quotable and dean

best and most toughly scottish character of the carl hemp order mr watson has yet drawnfull of the national pride as well as the national humour prone to small sinning in the way of an occasional dram but fiercely  independent in his sinning withal tender and as his death shows capable of giving away his life  past redemption  is not so perfectly artistic as  a servant lass but it is a very good second whether or not it be true as rumour has it that ian maclaren has said goodbye to drumtochty he has in hillocks jamie soutar domsie burnbrae posty and drum sheugh at all events drumsheugh before

attempt and not an unsuccessful one was made to show how little practical sympathy for the degro exists in the northern states but though the writer vehemently pressed his argument he was unable to conceal that while the condition of the slave in the southern states under a benevolent proprietor is far better than that of the free negro in the north nothing can be more wretched than his case if he has the misfortune to belong to a savage mrs fanny kembles residence in georgia which we reviewed in our number of the 6th of june gave us a picture of slavelife on an estate which had the reputation of being humanely managed making allowance for the colouring which a woman possessed of strong feelings and considerable eloquence could not help ging to such a subject the facts which she recounted materially affected our estimate of the creature comforts enjoyed by the slave even under a kind uster the book before us written with strong abolitionist ypathies leads us to believe that

have the right of absolute property over his fellowcreature is horrible enough that his passions should be allowed to extend this right over his own offspring is the last touch of horror wanting to complete the diabolical character of slavery yet the concurrent testimony to the fact is too strong to be doubted if mr kirke does not scandalously trifle with us when he states that he has narrated nothing which is not within his own knowledge we see that even nmen who are otherwise exemplary can mingle their blood with that of their female slates and that their offspring imay be sold to pay their debts where the master is unworthy there is no limit to this blackest of all baseness mr kirke narrates the case of a female slave who was flogged to death because she would not yield to the desires of her proprietor and throughout his book there are indications of the horrible working of slavery in this respect and the degradation which it spreads throughout society apart from its purpose the book is most interesting the story is not much but mr kirkes powers of description amply make up for the deficiency the main interest centres in mr preston and his slaves one of these phyllis and her child have been sold during prestons absence the child is his and by the aid of mr kirkewho tells the story in his own niamehe is enabled to repurchase them another of her children by the same father has been repurchased by mrs preston an amiable southern lady who though she has children of her own rescued this girl little selma knowing her husbands attachment to his offspring by phyllis by parting with her trinkets kirke and preston find phyllis while she is yet in the hands of the slavetrader at a village store in north carolinah er figure was slight and graceful and her face very beautiful she bad long black glossy hair straight regular features a rich olive complexion and large lustrous eyes which as she sat opposite the open door were fixed on the thick gloomy wood with an earnest almost agonised gaze as if she were reading in its tangled depths the dark uncertain future that lay before her never shall i forget the expression of her face never have i seen its look of keen intense agony and its full perfect utter despair one of the children was a little girl of eight years with a sweet hopeful expression a clear rosy skin and brown wavy hair and the other a little mulatto boy a few years older they each held one of the womans hands and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look closely at them a thin piece of iron called by slavetraders a b racelet encircled their wrists and fastened their arms to the womaus they were slaves  kirkes treaty with the slavetrader for the purchase of phyllis and her child rosey brings us again face to face with the disgustin details which accompany such transactions he tells enoufgrh to shock any nerves which have not been indurated by the traffic but declares himself unable to repeat all the atrocities he witnessed the woman is almost white and the trader in standing out for a high price describes how such slaves are prized by the  young bloods  of the south he shows too that dreadful as the traffic is men who pretend to religion even in the north are not ashamed to derive profit from it but the girl is ransomed and the party set out for prestons plantation near newbern here we find that prestons humanity to his slaves is ruining him and that with a hundred and fifty darkies he is going to the dogs while a certain colonel dawsey with only seventyfive works his estate at a profit preston explains how the colonel is so successfuldawsey has seventyfive slaves forty childbearing women twenty men and fifteen children under five years the sixty adults are all prime hands they are given daily tasks which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours leaving them only nin hours out of the twentyfour for eating sleeping feeding their children and the waking rest necessary to working people he never whips them on a weekday because it wastes working time but makes sunasy a general flogging season he has two women where he has one man and each woman is expected to bear a child every second year if she doesnt she is sold they are made to work in the field till the labour pains are on them and arm allowed only two weeks res ar confinement three of them have born children in the woods this season he keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children and as soon as each child is five years oldthe ag at which it can be legay sold awra from its motherit is disposed of to the trades in addition three of these women are his mixtresse and they must bave children as fast as the others he serves their children like the rat that is rears them to the age of five and then sells them as he would so many hogs mr kirke does not confine himself to details which tell against slavery his deseption of ms preston shows how the highest womanly qualities can flourish side by side with the most hateful of social institutions she was a perfect womana faithful mistress a loving wife a devoted mother an every want of her husband rully inscting breon overseeing every detail of her oueod ueting out th red allowance of the negroes viting daily the cabins of the ad the infi d with hw own d ds u om s ing or the king m iineor whm an medin fed bedbug the lowly bd o the dyin and poxi to h better oa h e a e g apiy a bjeia to is about her she wre ostly s lm h b i or jewels in her hair but she was arrayed in garments all rich and beautiful with human love suich women mr kirke writes are seen nowhere more often than in the south her husband too was solicitous for the religious wellbeing of his slaves his connexion with phyllis had terminated with his conversion to nobler thoughts and he taught his slaves their catechism and regularly attended the ministrations of the negro preacher old joe his grandfathers son by one of the old reprobates slaves side by side with the negros pitiable condition there is a vein of irresistible grotesqueness running through his life in nothing nmore remarkable than in his religious exercises joe had a rival in his clerical vocation a negro named jack whose gift was prayer and whose predilection was whisky the predilection was necessary to the full development of the rift mr kirke went to hear him open the sunday service gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment he drawled out my bredrin less us raise our hearts ter de lord the whiuce congregation then kneeled and jack closing his eyes clenching his hands together and throwing his bead back until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building  lifted up his voice and prayed  after the fashion of very many white preachers he began by telling the lord all about himself all he had ever done and all hie is going to do how long he had lived and how long he is going to live how great he is taller dan de mountains an bigger dan do seas how he made the world in six days and then gittin tired rested on de sevenfh how he formed man out of the dust of the ground and then out of his rib formed woman how the woman tempted the man and he fell and how woman has raised cain on the earth ever since how he sent the flood and how noah builded the ark how noah axed all the wild critters into it and how they all came in two by two and how noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly together till the wet spell was over how moses when he came down from the mount  stumbled and broke de law an how ebery one ob us dat hab come inter de worse sence hab stumbled an broke de law case he did how noah though he was a white man and had a white wife begat a black son and how that black son was a great sinner and how all his descendants have taken after him and been mighty big sinners ever since  then he described the sinner particularly the black sinners preeent and if half of what he said was tie every one of them deserved to be sold  down soufh and kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days  the prayer was a strange medley of absurdity presumption and profanity and i felt relieved to hear his long  amen and to see joe rise and agan approach the pulpit joes sermon is worth reading as a mental effort of a superior order in spite of the negro dialect but it is too long for quotation fir kirke gives it from memory adding that his report does it faint justice but we must hurry on with the story by kirkes advice preston takes a new estate and begins to thrive he commissions his friend to provide him with a governess mrs preston dies and her husband marries the  yankee girl who has been training his children the result is disastrous the new wife is a tartar and by her extravagance plunges her husband into debt this however is not the worst of her husbands troubles rosey his daughter by phyllis is married to ally a fellowslave and contrary to custom the marriage ceremony is performed allys mother dinah is present and contributes to an amusing scene any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway but i elbowed through the woolly gathering and followed frank and selma to the family pew tittering laughing and flaunting their redandyellow kerchiefs the black people were enjoying themselves amazingly when  dar dey comes darm de happy pussons went round the assemblage and the bride and groom attended by two sable couples entered the building after some ludicrous mistakes they got  into position in front of the railing and black joe took a stand before them  rosey was dressed in white with a neat fillet of pink and blue ribbon about her head and ally wore a black frockcoat with white vest and white cotton gloves one of the groomsmena rustic beau from a neighbouring plantationwore an immensely longtailed blue coat with brass buttons a flaming red waistcoat yellow woollen mittens and a neckerchief that looked like a secession flag hugging a lamppost both of these gentry had hats of stovepipe pattern very tall and with narrow bms and they wore them during the ceremony s  silence in de meetin  cried joe  the boisterous sea of black wool subsided to a dead calm those not already standing row and joe commenced reading the marriage service of the episcopal church  the parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well for they made all the responses with great propriety but some of the congregation seemed less familiar with the service when joe repeated the words if any man kin show cause why dese olks should not be lawfully jined togedder less him now speak or ele fbr eber hole his peace dinah turned to the audience and cried out yas jess less him come out wid it now rd like ter see de man dats got onyting agin it  no one appeared to have  onyting agin it and joe proceeded to read the wods i require and charge you if either of you how any impedment  in the midst of it a voice called oute dar it no pedimen bon joe i

be thy welded wife then dinah unable to contain her self longer joyfully exclaimed  ob course he will any youn fellerd be glad to hab htai the ceremony is then completed and is followed by a dance in which master joe prestons son1 makes himself conspicuous as roseys partner in one of the sets for his marvellous dancing but when the young mother is confined her child is white preston to his horror discovers that his son ignorant of the girls parentage is the father overwhelmed by this shock by his wifes cruelty and extravagance and by the hopeless state of his affairs hie dies and now mrs preston learns from phylliss slave husband that selma who has all along been supposed to be prestons daughter of pure white breed is the oflfpring of his amour with phyllis the girl has received the highest education and has grown up into a wouman of surpassing loveliness mr kirke describes her appearance at the opera in boston her mother was almost white her father pure white of such parentage selma is not the only issue famed for extraordinary beauty and now comes the crowning interest of the story selina is bought by her brother joe but frankan adopted son of mr kirkes and the illegitimate son of a wealthy and pious merchant of bostonwho has been betrothed to her and who loves her passionately recoils with horror at the idea of marrying a slave seldma commits suicide and frank on the outbreak of the war volunteers in the federal cause we recommend our readers to peruse this book and mr fairfaxs  elopement  together both are admirably written and give an excellent idea of the negros condition in the north and in the south we cannot say that the perusal of mr kirkes volume lessens our admiration of the heroism displayed by the southern armies but it gives us an estimate of the enormous difficulty which the confederacy will have to encounter whenever its independence shall have been recognized before it can be received into the family of civilised nations on a footing of equality it has our sympathies in its struggle with the insensate tyranny of the northern states but the institution on which its fortunes are based is in its best aspect so terrible that our sympathy must end with the cause which provoked it unless prompt measures are taken at least to open the path to liberty to all slaves who have the courage and intelligence to tread it,northamerica
  special messenger by robert w cham bers t werner laurie this writers chief asset is his sense of romance when he lays this aside and attempts the modem novel of psychology he fails  but in the romance of action and particularly of military action his talents bring very creditable success the present volume gives us nine distinct episodes in the career of a beautiful girl who served the union as  special messenger  during the american civil war the author with somewhat unnecessary sharpness disclaims any indebtedness to  miss boyd the famous confederate scout and spy   and the point is really immaterial his messenger interests us and is carried through her adventures in fine breathless style it is a vivid stirring piece of work well put together,northamerica
e  mollies prince by rosa nouchette carey hutchinson  co mollies prince is of the nature of a survival and on this and other grounds not to be entirely ignored stories of the kind have it seems a measure of popularity the general intention and the treatment of human nature in this one are certainly of the kindliest and the outlook on life persistently amiable but from the intellectual artistic or worldlyknowledge standpoint it cannot for obvious reasons be praised in construction and character it consists of what was twentyyears ago considered good enough for girl readers four couples at least are made happy ever after and everything necessary to existence and a good deal more is showered on those who know how to wait the ward family is discovered in the first chapter at a very low ebb financially speaking in a house facing the chelsea hospital an  umble ome no doubt but not till now associated with dire poverty and bootless misery yet it is just boots or their absence that frequently blocks the conversational path at no 10 cleveland terrace soon however the acute reader detects the rustle of angel wings and guardian spirits hovering in the distance the first to materialise is a viscount with twenty thousand a year his wayward ideal is to be loved for himself and tothis end he woos the lovely mollie in the disguise of a virtuous bohemianwhatever that may be unrestrained by mr ward the father of the family and  a proud man the younger man loads the larder with delicacies  game fruit wine and so forth flowers nicknacks consulting physicians concert tickets sofas trained nurses and other articles of use or adornment follow mr wards protests against these lavish proceedings are so faint and perfunctory and his eventual yielding so certain that the author is the only person who takes his apparent reluctance at ali seriously what the reader is likely to take rather seriously is the family joke it is frequent depressing and of the english hearthrug pattern not to share a little in miss careys joy in the presents that are the leitmotifoi the story would be churlish when some oneprobably the disguised nobleman insists on providing the wards with a fixed income and two trousseaux mollie has a sister and cleaning decorating and refurnishing the chelsea house the impecunious reader suffers an envious pang the cup runs over when maiden ladies also play fairy godmother to this simple but not unreceptive family two sapphirecoloured velveteen gowns for the girls evening wear are presented the only blot on the opulence of the picture is that they are not of velvet i the joyful climax for the reader and every one else comes when mr ward with that native touch of ephemeral hesitation accepts the hand of the rich and benevolent spinster he has jilted in early youth we leave everybody in a perfect maze of cheerful discoveries as to hidden relationships and longlost friends exactly like the people in novels of the early victorian period,northamerica
aunt philliss cabin or southern life as it is by mary h eastman philadelphia lippincott  co it is in the very nature of tyranny not to be able to bear being told that it is tyrannous you belong to me body and soul said louis quatorze to one of his household and if i tell you to leap into the rea you will be bound to do it the young noble bowed low and was retiring  where are you going to i asked the great king  to learn to swim sire returned the welldressed slave with a yet lower bow louis laughed at the joke though he was not a man to feel its pointyour owners of men body and soul in the great american plantations have lately been told to their faces with half the civilised world for audience of the words that their moral life isand must bea contradiction of itself so long as the mer i chandise in human beings is carried on by them the truth was outspokenclear ringing unmistakeableand they are of course angry and responsive mrs stowes narrative uncle toms cabin stands somewhat outside the usual barriers of fiction as a novelon the score of its art it is easy to find fault with it and when introducing it to the notice of our readers we ourselves pointed out its artistic defect lt is fairly a question too whether fiction is a sound vehicle for the conveyance of ethics and on that subject we have opinions of our own of which our readers have had the benefit more than once many however of even those who agree with us as to the principle will think that there are cases of exception in which its application may be waived in favour of particular circumstances  and many we know look on mrs stowes book as presenting one of these cases the authoress has guaranteed the authenticity of her facts and the truth of her characters and it is as a faithful picture of negro life in the southern states with its perils its romance and its temptationsits debasing tendencies and its utter want of morai logie  that this book is now having a reading throughout the length and breadth of the land in america and here it is in this sense also that it has been answered in books in magazine aud in newspapers the acceptance of the book in this country i is itself a literary fact of some interest our i advertising columns show that the sale is enor  mous we can scat edy count the number of editions that have appeared there ave lying  before us as we write a handsomely illustrated  edition for the boudoir and a sixpenny reprint  for the cabin with intermediate issues of various j sizes and prices one of these is announced j a3 the ninetyfifth thousanda second as the j thirtietha third as thc twentyfifthand so i forth there are possibly two hundred thousand  copies now circulating in the british islands i this success is not altogether personal  it is a national response to an appeal powerfully made in a great cause the book at the head of this article is one of the answers to mrs stow which have appeared on the other side of the atlantic it is also written by a ladya lady who appears to be familiar with the ways of negro life in virginia if not farther south mrs eastman is dogmatic and decisive she talks of the northerner with a freedom and a vehemence that would suggest nothing but gunpowder and thc bowieknife to the more peppery spirits of the other sex in a long preface to her story she defends slavery against all assailants as  gods own institutionand in a still longer appendix she derides and denies all the facts and points brought forward in mrs stowes narrative the laugh is certainly sometimes on her side she makes herself merry at the idea of uncle toms power of converting negroes  certainly the weak point of mrs stowes book and maliciously reminds the reader that cassy steals  money and tells lies after her miraculous con i version in the ginhouse she is still more dclighted to throw a lance at the  strongminded  women of new england and is particularly  happy in her sarcasms on the doings of a certain j female society for setting the world to itights j she even intimates that the strong minded will  not object to a little lying when it suits their i benevolent purpose as for example i  as regards the practice of marking negroes in  the hand i look upon it as one of the imaginary i horrors of the timcsa delusion like spiritual rap i pings got up out of sheer timidity of disposition i though i have heard of burning old women for  witches in new england and placing a scarlet letter i on the bosom of some unhappy one who had already j sorrow and sin enough to boar it wont do the  subject has without doubt been duly investigated i already id be willing were i not opposed to betting to bet my best collar and neck ribbon that a committee of investigation has been appointed consisting of twelve of bostons primmest old maids i and they have been scouring the plantations of the i south bidding the negroes hold out their hands not  as the poor souls will at first suppose that they may be crossed with a piece of silver and that they are now returning crestfal len to their native city not having seen a branded hand in all their journeying could aught escape their vigilance but they will say they saw a vast number and that will answer the purpose but these are points which we must leave the ladies to settle amongst themselves of course mrs eastman has no such slaveowner to show in her corps de ballet as legree because as she says no such monster ever lived except in the person of the northern professor who murdered his creditor for a mere matter of money  our readers shall if they please make the acquaintance of aunt phillis and her husband uncle bacchusthe last first notwithstanding the etiquette because the sketch gives us a full glimpse into negro life as the virginia slaveowners would have the world believe it now to exist  it was just sundovn but the servants were al at home after their days woik and they too were enjoying the pleasant evening time some were seated at the door nf their cabin others lounging on the grass all at cvse and without care jw any of their comfortable uibiiis had been recently v hunwashed and were adorned wili little garden in front over the one nearest the house a multiflon roic was creeping in full bloom singularly mtkica voices were heard at into vas singing snatches ol songs of a style in which the servants of the south specially delight and not unfreiiuently as the fu j chorus was shouted by a number their still mer peculiar laugh was heard above it all mr barbour had recently returned from a tur in our northern  states had been absent fr two months and felt that  he had not in as long a time witnessed such a scene ol real enjoyment isle thought it would have softened the heart of the sternest later of southern institutions to have beena spectator herc it might possibly have inclined him to think though sun of his creators beneficence shines over every j art of our favoured land take a teat my dear sir mr weston said in our sweetbriar horse ns alice calls it the evening would lose half its beauty to us if we wire within alice is always right said mr barbour  in everything she says and dots and sol will

time before he reached the piazza but on asceud  ing the steps he made a particularly low bow to his master and then in thc same manner though j with much less reverence paid his respects to  the others well bacchus said mr weston  how is ycr health dis cvenin master  you aint  been so well latterly well soon have green com  though and that helps dyspepsy wonderfulii  may be good for dyspepsia

blessed grief miss alice said he  shed make me eat de bottle chaw up all de glass swaller it arter dat i aint ever tried dat yetbest not to i reckon no master i intends to keep sober from this time forrud till young master comes back it is thus throughout the slaves are weak a little lazy move than a little given to strong waters and their owners are uniformly mild affectionate and indulgent but listen to the story of aunt phillis the black heroine of this book she was a firm believer in the bible and often pondered on the words of the angel return nnd submit thyself to thy mistress she had on one occasion accompanied her master and mrs weston to the north where she was soon found out by some of that disinterested class of individuals called abolitionists in reply to the question are you free there was but a moments hesitation her pride of heart gave way to her inherent love of truth ill tell no lieshe answered i ama slavewhy do you not tale your freedomwas the rejoinder  you are in a free state they cannot force you to the south if you will tike the offer we make you and leave your master you are abolitionists i spose asked philliswe are they said and we will help you off i want none of your help said phillis  my husband and children are at home but if they wasnt i nm an honest woman and am not in the habit of taking anything ill never take my freedom if my master would give it me and the rest of us i should be thankful i am not going to begin stealing and i fifty years of age an eyewitness described the straightening of her tall figure and the indignant flashing of her eye also the discomfited looks of her northern friends i have somewhere read of a fable of iceland according to it lost souls are to be parched in the burning heat of hecla and then cast for ever to cool in its neverthawing snows although phillis could not have quoted this her opinions would have applied it for some reason it was evident to her mind for she had been well instructed in the bible that slavery was from the first ordained as a curse it might to her high spirit have been like burning in the bosom of hecla but taking refuge among abolitionists was from the many instances that had come to her knowledge like cooling in its neverthawing snows with mrs eastman slavery is all bedecked with flowers and besprinkled with rosewater it is sweet to the sense and consoling to the heart with her it is a beautiful and interesting thing to be a slaveand the worst that can happen to a quadroon or a negress is to gain her freedom one of the figures of her storysusanlistens to the abolitionists and gets entrapped into personal liberty but repenting thereof she begs to be made a slave againwhen her mistress makes an example of her and refuses to take her back this has been the prattle of men in all times in reference to the peculiar institution when burly old johnson poured out one of his scornful denunciations of slavery little boswell held up his hands in pious horror and declared that  to abolish the slavetrade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind listen to one little anecdote told hy mrs eastman pfirenthetically when she ceases for a moment to write fiction and rises into history  we have n servant woman named phillis her price is far above rubies her industry her honesty her attachment to our family exceed everything i wish abolitionists would imitate one of her virtues humility i know of no poetry more beautiful than the hymns she sang to me in my infancy her whole life has been a recommendation of the religion of the bible i wish my chance of heaven were half as good us hers she is a slave here but she is destined to he a saint hereafter we think mrs eastman here as in many another place where she thinks she is building an argument is very unconsciously giving it a dangerous side blow that is the fault of her materials the tools with which she works are sharpedged and they cut her own case  if mrs eastman received a visit from an angel would she like to detain the celestial stranger for a place in the sugar plantations or to put the case lower would she like to keep in bondage the heir to an earldom or principality knowing him to be rich and certain tc inherit his estate in due course or like the king who keeps a fool or the quack who hires a poet does sne think it respectable and in the way of business for a virginian planter to owr a saint  our readers will have seen by this time that this advocate for  god8 own institution is more earnest than adroit she means to put in a good word for the lords and masters of the southbut her nonadmissions and su gestions support in a remarkable manner the conclusions which on this side of the atlantic most people would draw from the perusal of such works as  uncle toms

deacon bradbury by elwin asa dix macmillan  co the taste for novels of a dreary religious cast seems to be strong in america at all events among american novelists whether they know their market or not is a different matter the climax of dreariness in 4 deacon bradbury is reached in the sermon delivered on the occasion of the formal withdrawal of the deacon from the congregational church at felton in the state of vermont here however the authors relish for his work seems most keen and here no doubt he is making his strongest appeal to his readers but the book is stated to be a novel and must be judged as such all this sernvm should have been cut out for the rest the writing is not without good points the presentment of the dour and sturdy deacon is strong there is a dash of a grim sort of humour in the story and the deacons lively daughters are pleasantly and vivaciously sketched  deacon bradbury by edwin asa dix macmillan bs a commonplace plot carefully worked out and redeemed by a clever characterstudy the story hinges upon the young manonly too well known in fictionwho for no conceivable reason allows himself to be wrongly suspected of theft he cannot even plead the excuse that he does it to shield another he has in fact no excuse to offer at all except that of his quite abnormal pride of course the case is cleared up in the end but not before the young mans fatherpoor old deacon bradbury  has become hopelessly alienated from the church of his baptism by reason of his sons supposed fall the deacon himself is a distinct success and by far the best thing in the book is his pathetic awakening to the consciousness of a lost faith first in his son and then in the god he had striven to serve so faithfully a providence who can allow calamities to befall the good upset all deacon bradburys ideas of justice he had seen the same system at work among his friends but as he justly remarks it makes a mighty big difference whose ox is gored we confess to a shrinking from the vermont dialect as given us by mr dix and we wish he would not belabour his pages with so many americanisms but he has humour and as we said before the book is interesting by reason of deacon bradbury  deacon bradbury by e a dix a very american story the scene of which is laid in an american village the dialect which is prominent on every page is not easy to those who speak the tongue that shakespeare spake  bcause i aint an id likeno oned like bettertove given a trifle in this matter fr instancethat is ef y d ve accepted it mr dix may be entirely right but his method of spelling does not vastly allure the reader macmillan 6s,northamerica
patience sparhawk and her times by gertrude atherton 65 lane try to conceive  the story of an african farm 0 without its passion for morality and you will get some idea of mrs athertons new book it is the novel of a clever woman of overflowing energy and burning interest in life but it is terribly crude and to european eyes terribly solemn with the aggressive solemnity of youth primarily it is a protest against the tame american novel and a claim that the people of the united states are very independent in ideals and conduct and very much themselves patience is a defiant portrait of a defiant woman to the mere reader she is a conceited badtempered and vulgar person a not unnatural product of a shocking bringing up but her creator proudly shows her with the manhood of new york at her feet paying her outrageously illbred compliments the refreshing thing about patience is her strong belief in the sanitary influence of brains which have been rather underrated by heroines of her order in recent fiction mrs atherton we are sure is not her apologist she likes her just sodefiant rasping grasping flattery and powerperhaps wishes she were worse but seeing she is neither exemplary nor charming a reader who cares more for general human nature than for any temporary phase of the american woman will ask what is the good of her to him her career is spasmodically interesting the society scenes we cannot accept as true to life but her experience among the temperance women and the newspaper men are at least very lively as a story however we own our real interest was first roused when bourke on his engine was racing the new york express with the confession which was to save patience from a criminals death in the electrical chair altogether it is a book that interests us more in its writer than in itself all the characters who have anything to say talk essays by this means mrs atherton has got rid of much matter weighing on her mind and so presumably she will move along more swimmingly next time  fiction patience sparhawk and her times by n gertrude atherton john lane dubing these two or three years certain social sketches published in vanity fair over the signature of mrs atherton have indicated the settlement in our midst of an american writer of much promise now comes the novel it cannot be denied that upon the whole the promise is fulfilled in one of its many aspects the book invites and indeed deserves ridicule it is ridiculous as the embodiment of mrs athertons philosophical proposition about the women of america these dames and damsels may really be struggling to be free from the conventions which keep society decent and girlhood charming but we cannot believe that they will ever as a class settle down into the humourless hetairism in which practically all the characters of this book spend the mid period of the romance mrs athertons philosophy of the american woman need not however trouble us long it springs from an excess of zeal and may be overlooked the story itself is fresh and arresting patience sparhawk is at school when we make her acquaintance her father is dead and her mother is given to drink and wantoning and young as she is patience who has a sensitive soul is bitterly at issue with the world dreary this state of affairs undoubtedly is but it is treated with extraordinary skill so keenly sympathetic is mrs athertons study of the strange rural life in america that we follow her for many chapters with a very unusual interest her perceptions are acute and her reflections are extraordinarily well phrased nor does the work fall off when having tried to kill her mother patience leaves home for the great city there she is taken charge of by two maiden relations whose evangelical activities george eliot herself could scarce have depicted with finer art meanwhile patience has been developing her spanish nature has blossomed into a critical reticent hauteur and she has become beautiful there ends mrs athertons essay in real literature the lovemaking and the wedlocks which follow will not bear examination the book reveals an unusual perspicacity as regards women but mrs athertons men are not good with the exception of the two editors under whose joint auspices patience becomes a  newspaper woman the male characters in the book are unnatural finally being suspected of having poisoned her husband patience is condemned to death thereupon the novelist finds her proper pace again and the pace is rapid times without record the same situation has been made use of by sensational writers but we should be surprised to learn that it has ever been more effectively treated than it is in this novel the narrative flies before our eyes as fast as the special ttain which is bearing the reprieve and a new lover to the gaol in which the heroine is about to be  electrocuted it is not literature of a high kind  but such ns it is it is brilliant,northamerica
  a lady of quality i by frances hodgson a burnett warne  co it is certain that no more striking proof has yet been given of mrs hodgson burnetts versatility than in her latest work and versatility if the most prominent is not the only feature that strikes us in a lady of quality mistress clorinda is a dramatic figure after the style of mr george meredith whether it be the baby arousing sir jeoffrys paternal interest by the use of his own huntingcrop and the language of his own stable as applied to himself or the beautiful girl riding to hounds in breeches with her fathers boon companions or again for her own ends adopting brocaded petticoats a dignified demeanour and a duenna but still the terror of her householdtho reader will follow with fascinated interest the fortunes of clorinda wildairs it is idle to reflect whether such a woman could have had her being even in the eighteenth century her later history raises a moral question of which space denies us the full discussion that a woman may break two important commandments and yet live successively as the honoured wife of an earl and a duke and ultimately die in the odour of sanctity as the purest and noblest lady god eer loved seems to our thinking unfair  not i said she as a girl  there thou mayest trust me i would not be found out and she kept her word with conscientious success it would seem that her great love for the duke worked in her a great redemption certainly the duchess of osmonde led not merely a blameless so much might be said for the countess of dunstanwolde but an admirable life and mrs burnett is obviously as convinced of her heroines virtues as the duke himself even the pious anne an excellent foil throughout to her tempestuous sister absolves her from the need of confession to her husband it might be urged in her defence that such a woman is a law unto herself or again that the necessity as clorinda judged it for the second crime was sufficient punishment for the first for ourselves we are oldfashioned enough to consider the moral doubtful be that as it may clorinda whether as maid countess or duchess is a strong not to say daring figure marred by an occasional lapse into cheap sensationa fault to be deplored in mrs burnetts workbut as a whole unquestionably striking it is greatly to the credit of the story that it holds in itself sufficient life and movement to carry us over the tedious reproduction of eighteenth century language upon which as well as upon the setting generally the author has bestowed an infinity of pains,northamerica

wind aid whirlwind  o xorel by mr thom white new york putnam  sons mr thomas whites american publishers are in such eagerness for our opinion of his story that they have sent us what they are pleased to call an  advance copy of the work which in their haste to lay it on our table they have omitted to bind apart from certain verbal antics which the writer doubtless would have us commend as indications of originality the tale is a commonplace narrative of seduction and consequent wretchedness of the seducer and his victim from an announcement appended to the unbound leaves it appears that  wind and whirlwind will 1 e followed by  hops and honey jimmys adventures and other productions unless the succeeding stories surpass the present tale in strength and artistic design they will not do much for mr whites fame or his publishers fortunes,northamerica

an altar of earth by thymol monk pioneer series 2s w1 net heinemann a sacrifice such as this story commemorates might rouse sympathy in readers under certain conditions namely that the sacrificeof personal honour for the good of humanity should be made for a really adequate cause should be absolutely essential in order to gain the object in view and should be undergone by some one whose dignity and general steadiness of character are not open to doubt at least these conditions are necessary where the literary representation of such a sacrifice is concerned at its peril does literature depend on receiving from its most freeminded critics the more tolerant less logical judgement of freeminded critics of life now many readers will say the first condition is not fulfilled and all must do the same for the second though we agree that the heroisms of hysterical persons are heroic yet daphnes general behaviour and conversation are such as to make us half believe her sacrifice to be a mere freak and though those who read to the end would have been angry had the sacrifice been ever completed still it knocks the bottom out of the whole story to prepare you as early as p  1 for the probability that it will never be required at all there is much pretty writing in the book about pan and country things and some cleverness too but as a representation of life  an altar of earth  is essentially weak,northamerica

1 the promised land from the danish of  henrik pontoppidan by mrs edgar lucas dent  cowe are glad to notice that henrik pontoppidan is gradually becoming known among us it is now six years since the publication of 4 the apothecarys daughters the first of his works we believe that was ever translated into english and messrs dent have just brought out adequate english versions of 4 muld and its sequel now before us 4 debt forjrettede land pontoppidan possesses many of the qualities which should make him popular with all classes of the english public his art is cheerful sane and healthy  he is a genuine humourist with a keen eye but also an indulgent smile for the foibles of his fellows and his simple concise and pregnant style pointed with light irony and graceful satire reminding one occasionally of guy de maupassant especially in his shorter stories is that of the true raconteur the present novel as already mentioned is the sequel to 4muld also translated by mrs edgar lucas under the title of  emanuel  or children of the soil the 44children of the soil are of course the peasants and emanuel is an enthusiastic young parson who in order to realise his socialistic ideals deliberately turns his back on all that wealth and culture can offer him takes a peasant girl to wife and settles down among the countryfolk as one of themselves  the promised land is the pathetic story of his gradual disenchantment and somewhat shamefaced return to civilization sacrificing in the process the noble wife of whom he is not worthy it is an exceedingly clever study of the most diverse types of character standing out against a vivid and convincing background of danish village life and village politics the parson himself his muchenduring wife his children his selfseeking and unstable flock to whom he sacrifices in vain seven of the best years of his life and his aristocratic friends who ultimately reclaim him supply excellent entertainment the translator has on the whole done her work well downright blunders are creditably few but her sentences are occasionally e g on pp 151 and 195 clumsy and involved faults of style which herr pontoppidan himself is absolutely incapable of committing the book is prettily illustrated by nelly erichsen,northamerica

tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a nobleman thus addresses i lady whom it minute liefore he wiis going to marry  acaunt jiend quit my sight fur cree  i u tadd face len score ofdecis i rather than hi inda thee    th mt tis base  reptile  liens all thy doing c

which to usc a vulgar but expressive phrase was i complete hectic squasher these we suppose are among the peculiarities which have contributed to give wings to the fame of these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling their too obviously imperfect and defective education  talee of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beau clerk and henrietta maary beauclerk smith elder  co there is much that is silly some things which are absurd with a good deal that is clever in this volume we have seldom seen a work of more unequal merit there is a mixture of poetry and prose in the contents the prose is the best the poetry is poor in the extreme the merit of the work chiefly consists in the insight it gives into the foibles arid follies of the fashionable world the volume professes to be only the first of a series we doubt much whether its success will be such as to induce the fair authoresses to continue the series,northamerica

continually cropping up unexpectedly there are plenty of other evidences of the brilliant success we have met with in macadamizing the intellectual and moral as well as the scientific world we detest anything slow we are not certain that the  arabian nights  is not one of the most truthful books we retain in our library works on theology seem to be getting more and more dull they want to destroy all sensations and reduce us to believe nothing but what we see we enjoy for our part these sensations  life would be stale watercress without them we go to the theatre to hear singers and behold dancers but unless the one can scream louder and longer and higher than a railway whistle and the other keep both legs in the air for several seconds together we are terribly bored we rejoice to find these audacious jumps at popularity in novel writers our preachers and their sermons are wfullv stuetd o4jf want to become coodin mmmldfakiond  way lei uh gdeg aw y we it is so wslsoolearly revealed

virtue it is for the welleducated and wellborn of society that you must prepare your tabl and whet your scalpel these are your real criminals to whom you must show no mercy as for the worthless they are so much more interesting they must be acquitted  it is society which deserves the gibbet with regard to the st le it must be clear and terse brimful of nice contrasts and teeming with delicate sentiment you must take original views of things or your novel will be flat learn something of surgery  you must have attended a great many sayings out or your descriptions will not horrify perhaps only provoke a laughand then your book will take perhaps the best method for stopping any unseemly cachinnation is to make religion ancillary to your general design just as one sacred song is put by way of grace at the head of a programme of secular music besides nothing spices so much to the publie taste as quotations from the bible did not the swearing club obtain a still more exhilarating spirit amongst the london casuals from this skilful use of religion in sober earnest although a writer may profess in tike preface the most exalted views  and the most zealous desire for doing good v if we find the subject made agreeable and witty we must crave permission to doubt not the intention but the moral value of the work ffidendepths  professes to deal with the social evil but we fear takes much too onesided a view of the question for its cure we cannot deny that the work is well written and interesting  and sets the cure in a true light so far as seduction is concerned no one can regard this crime with too great horror the delicacy of the female sex once removed and it really seems as if nothing were left to it of that shrinking modesty or of that tender selfsacrificing affection so peculiar to women we hold with the writer of  hidden depths that no punishment can be too severe for the wilfui coldblooded seducer of innocence  bat then we require first to be satisfied of the innocence we cannot help feeling that very little account is made of the sin itself by the writer we are told with truth that the social evil is hardly held as a sin by the lower class supposing then that the offender held up to our execration in this novel instead of deserting his victim had pensioned her off before his marriage to another the novel could not have continued to choose what we hope is an extreme case for our inspection is not the best plan for preventing the fate of thousands of women which occurs from far more ordinary causes what are the statistics of seduction and of what the writer would connect with it suicide  take country villages as a test and a fair one in this case as the author describes his unfomunates as innocent country girls w have known an instance of a labourer wjfafe applied to his clergyman for help towwsib the maintenance of his illegitimate child alleging that it was the custom of the bjjfj teadeavosr to secure husbands by mwfig uaeof acode of honour long estahlinmd £ig the lowest classnamely that if m mm had two illegitimate children mt mmmmm f th sass mother it was then his duty to marry her one such birth was not held sufficient cause again working in the fields is another fruitful source of contamination  the language and conduct of the married women being beyond measure vile we write it in sorrow  but the  innocent abodes of the poor with eight or ten persons of various ages sleeping in one bedroom do not yet exist vanity love of dress the desire of a life of excitement proved by female servants declining what they consider dull places the spread of light literature speaking slightingly of such connexions between rich and poorsuch as these are the real sources of the evil among such a class you will not find many who are goaded by excess of feeling or remorse to commit suicide the statistics of suicide prove that the most trifling causes such as sudden passion or illtemper will induce persons to destroy themselves what a terrible indifference to infanticide does the now celebrated case of the devonshire murderess discloseand by the way we have her photograph in hidden depths we now give a sketch of the story the heroine ernestine courtenay is engaged in the search for the sister of a girllois brook seduced by colonel courtenay her brother the girl lois brook commits suicide on being deserted and leaves a letter imploring the colonel to save her younger sister annie from a like melancholy end ernestine who is engaged to a mr lingard sets out with his permission on the search for annie brook who has been also seduced and cast off by her lover the tale shows us the social difficulties which meet ernestine in her mission she finds out the parents of the two girls  the father refuses to take back his child fearing the disgrace and loss of his place as lodgekeeper in a noblemans park  the mother gives a portrait of annie and a clue to the place where she is ernestine meets with a rebuff from lady carleton in asking permission for annies return to her fathers home she then goes to greyburgh university where her brother keginald is residing there she finds her brother dying and in a state of great mental trial from infidel views instilled into him by his college tutor two clergymen are introduced  the first is rector of the oarish in which annie brook is living a o dr granby is horrified at the notion of permitting a profligate to come near his house a good deal of wit is made out of his excuses for not seeking the lost he recommends ernestine to give up the search and to engage herself in real works of charity such as teaching an infant school  to clap their hands in unison or to imitate his daughter marie who leads c our little choir in term time when several of the collegians assist at our services and can appreciate our musical efforts we must here confess our surprise at any clergyman of a large parish represented as being so ludicrously indifferent to the cases of unfortunate girls of whose existence in visiting the poor he must continually be reminded and actually brought into contact with on their sick beds the other clergyman a mr thorold is represented as fully engaged in all the usual parish work of nightschools reformatories c as the book is published in scotlaud we hope that it is simply ignorance on the part of the author as to the conduct of the parish clergy who all more or less must meet with many cases connected with the social evil annie brook is at last found and persuaded to enter a reformatorythe discipline of which is too severe for her  she runs away but prefers rather to starve than to have recourse to the streets again she dies in the hospital but before her death recognises and forgives her first seducer lingard he of course is disclaimed for ever by ernestine who gives herself up to the work of recovering lost females we are treated to four deaths in the book three minutely described and the bodies properly laid out we find a great deal of poetical description as well as sentimental writing all the unfortunates are beautiful mis guided impulsive and affectionate we cannot think that the work although well written and interesting is quite in character with the very serious preface which informs us that the work is not one of fiction for  though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records much of the social evil is attributed teyoung men at the universityboys really of from sixteen to eighteen about whom the girls of the town congregate no doubt but innocent young women are not seduced out of the villages near as the author would indicate the language and turn of thought put into the mouths of the unfortunates are by no means true to nature as the author states in the work the sin itself is but lightly regarded among the poor they would therefore be very unlikely to speak or think even as here represented we cannot get over the feeling that the author more reprobates the desertion than the seduction of females the remarks about the overseverity of reformatories are good  but we cannot forget the overtenderness which lets loose ticketofleave men on the public the real fact is that if half the interest were displayed toward our poorest class before they become so interesting through sin and crime we should be fostering that sympathy between class and class which mr justice talfourd in his last charge declared to be so sadly wanting far more than by endeavouring to cure the evil after its spread the social evil will never be healed by novel writers however talented they may be the attack must not be made on human nature but on those evils which render that nature so weak and are thus the causes of the mischiefviz ignorance and the crowded dwellings of the poor and the poverty which makes them regard money as the sole good in life to be obtained at all hazards there are many landed proprietors even in mucliabtised dorset who are heartily working for the good of the poor by building cottages with more bedrooms the wages are also fixed at a higher rate by those gentlemen with the same objectthat of improving the moral condition of the labourers on their estates all this must be a work of time  and after all we cannot expect that the social evil can be ever eradicated until the whole world is in a far different state from what we now behold when there is no longer any more dishonesty or violence or deceit there will also be no more profligacy meanwhile if the efforts of philanthropists are directed not to exciting morbid sympathy towards the poor but to teaching men more selfrespect they will materially lessen the social evil  hidden depths tiim1 authoress of this very remarkable book writes with vehement earnestness taking for the motto of her work the axiom  verita4 ea major charitas  but we are sorry to say that her earnestness is in excess of her judgment and that what she takes for absolute truth is but a very limited part of a great and complex whole still though we are compelled for the truths sake to pass this apparently sweeping censure upon her work we are equally compelled to bear witness to the high intention with which she has laboured the extraordinary circumstance of a delicate pious and intellectuallygifted woman writingeven anonymouslyon the subject of the  social evil is in itself enough to bespeak respectful attention for her book but in addition the writer of  hidden depths is entitled to special consideration for the striking literary power she exhibits in the present volumes had she contented herself with writing an ordinary novel in which the sin of seduction was held up to the reprobation and scorn of all rightminded readers we are sure she would have deserved to be recognised as worthy of a conspicuous place in the ranks of contemporary english novelwriters she has chosen however to write with a purpose and we might almost say has courted failure for the admiration which hidden depths is well calculated to inspire so long as it is considered in the light of a work of fiction is turned to objection when the story with its narrow bounds and partial exhibition of facts has to be viewed as the exposition of a gigantic social disorderthe most saddening difficult not to say hopeless problem of civilised life 4 though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records in this sentence taken from the authoresss preface we detect the error which underlies the whole argument of her book what happens mostly in the case of those who act upon mere philanthropical impulse has happened in her case having become possessed of a few facts she has taken them as representing the whole truth of the subject on which they bear it is clearly to be inferred from her book that she believes seductionthat is to say the systematic ruin of perfectly innocent girls by heartless profligatesto be one of the chief causes of the vice in question but how utterly without foundation such a belief must be is known to every one who has ventured to inquire into the subject at all it is most probable that the writer of  hidden depths  has heard the story of the happy home the perfect innocence the advent of the betrayer the faill from virtue the abandonment and all the other incidents related by some reclaimed unfortunate the mistake she has made is in having given a too ready credence to a relation which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred is found upon searching inquiryr to be wholly or in great part untrue of the poor wretches who qualify themselves to take the distinctive title of unfortunates it is almost certain that not ten in a thousand adopt that miserable calling from the cause assigned by her we need not recapitulate the score of wellascertained causes and we will only say that they have been found enough to daunt the boldest seekers for a remedy the authoress of  hidden depths thinks she has only to take her bible in hand and the cure is found through the lips of her heroine she cries in answer to the objection that she is possibly compromising herself in attempting to reclaim one only out of a tribe better ignored altogether  one onlybut that one an immortal soul that never in all the eternal ages can cease to live and living to suffer if in the whole world there is not enough of compassion found to save her from a doom of such unitnagined horror one only but that one unspeakably precious in the sight of the god who made her for himself that we know his beloved son would have come down from heaven to die in his awful agony for her alone had she only of all the human race been perishing and sinful you speak of thousands like her is it not enough to crush ones very soul with horror to think of what they are in the sight of the righteous heaven and shall be probably for ever  and the thought that it is their own fellowcreatures who have thus blasted their souls with eternal ruin makes one wonder that god ehould still withhold the fire which one day must justly bu to ashes a world so cruel and so polluted and cm you think hugh that apart from the judgement which will fall upon the active agents in the ruin of the thousands of whom you speak there will be no account demanded of their blood from those who were passive instruments in their destruction who might have helped who might have saved them and would not  on such as i am who ought to be ready to give my whole life to win all and any i could am i to abstain from rescuing one one actually given into my hand because some painful humiliation some bitter thence may come to wound my vanity from those who make this worlds approval the idol of their worship oh what will all that wrlnd be to me wpi am lyidg cold and stiff in the grave whence there in no reaw  how much more then wctthless in that silent time of waiting wiu be its praise or blamthe praise or blame of those who will be dust and ashes ike myself but will not the doom of that owe lost soul be eveythiu to mete 0u1l that will meet me at e baer afjand out egieist m idden depths two vdojuxl u uin md dools6 you might have saved me and you did not therefore you are my condemnation you are my sentence you are my everlasting despair   we give this passage as a specimen of the authoresss style and as affording at the same time an indication of her enthusiastic unpractical view of the subject with which she has undertaken to deal in the course of her narrative however occasional remarks will be foundwith reference to homes for fallen women and analogous institutions for exampleindicative of a large capacity for actual work it appears hard to say that what she has done has been useless labour but the most we can hope from it is that it may serve to set thinking some who never thought before of this ugly side of their social existence by all means let anything and everything that can be done be done to save individual souls by earnest doers like the authoress of  hidden depths the more closely the subject of the social evil is looked at by intelligent women the more likelihood is there of means being found to mitigate the abomination it is beyond doubt in the power of women to give a purer tone to society by doing their best to discountenance all profligacy of life in the men of their own families as well as those with whom they are otherwise brought into contact at present nothing of the kind is done and so long as no  inconvenience results even notorious impurity of life is held to be no disqualification for a man in society indeed the man of many mistresses is an object of special interest and regard with thousands of women who would affect the utmost horror and indignation at being brought into personal relationship with any woman of sullied reputation but these remarks apply only to the upper classes among the lower classes where the horrors of the social evil spread widest it is useless to think of any such ameliorating influence as that which it is possible for the women of the superior classes to exert the authoress of  hidden depths  takes no account of unfortunates below the grade of gentlemens abandoned mistresses or of the mercenaries of university towns and in saying this perhaps we say enough to show that her earnestness has been spent upon a mere fragment or two of the innumerable wrecks that strew the deadsea shore of this miserable subject we are glad however to recognise in her present work signs of an admirable literary faculty read as a work of fiction we are sure that  hidden depths  will not fail to interest thoughtful readers far beyond the average of

  cache la poudre by herbert myrick kegan paul  co this curious production is described in a subtitle as  the romance of a tenderfoot in the days of custer it is illustrated profusely from paintings and photographs and is a rambling tale of adventurous life in the far west of america in days when lynchings and fights with indians were matters of everyday occurrence the absence of constructive method even of ordinary coherence in the story indicates an unaccustomed hand the book has however the merit of comparative fidelity to actual fact there is a lengthy appendix the frequent allusions to which in the text are rather damaging to the romantic interest of the tale the photographs are interesting and there is certainly material enough in the volume for half a dozen romances,northamerica
cecilia a story of modem rome by francis marion crawford macmillan  co a new novel from the pen of mr crawford comes as a welcome change after a series of badly designed and ill  written stories he certainly conceives a definite history and delineates definite characters he both thinks and writes while all too many of our purveyors of current fiction seem to consider thinking and writing two of the things least essential in the preparation of a story in  cecilia mr crawford takes us once more into the roman society which he knows so well and which he has again and again deftly delineated here once more he uses in a fresh and effective fashion facts or fictions from the debatable borderland between the provinces of ascertained science and occult lore the heroine is in some mysterious way a reincarnation of the last of the vestal virgins and is capable of throwing herself into a kind of hypnotic trance in which she lives over again some of the thrilling moments which preceded the close of her sacred office stranger still the man whom she sees in the trance is also reincarnated in modern rome and sees in dreams that which she witnesses when hypnotized when the two meet for the first time in the flesh it is to be conscious that they have long known each other in the spirit and from this is subtly woven an entrancing tale of the beauty and tragedy of love unlike some of the fictionwriters who venture into the mysteries of the occult mr crawford never lets us lose touch with the actual so that we are impressed by the story as we are by the records of the salpetriere cecilia is in every way worthy of its authors reputation  cecilia a story of modern rome by f marion crawford macmillan 6s mr crawfords new story though its subtitle painfully recalls the two much discussed novels set in that city of which the public has recently heard so much has nothing in common either in manner or matter with this school of fiction  cecilia  is the story of two men and a girl and is destitute of all political and sermonising pretensions to a large extent it is a study of telepathy and selfhypnotism but though the unexplained is touched upon the atmosphere of the story remains simple and almost tranquil throughout cecilia an heiress and the man lamberti meet for the first time only to realise that they are already perfectly familiar with one another the girl has dreamed of him all her life and from that meeting each commences to dream of the other every nightthe same dreamand both awake to hear their doors close softly as if after someones departure though both invariably lock themselves in upon retiring to rest lamberti is a sailor a born fightingman who had seen much active service in remote parts of africa china and elsewhere upon the commencement of the dreams he not unnaturally consults a nerve specialist but is found completely sound in mind and body the girl meanwhile lias become engaged to his greatest friend the marriage is near before she realises that she is passionately in love with the man of her dreamsthe nan she kisses every night in a state of trance or self1 ypnotipm then there is trouble but in the end though lovers avhom fate has predestined apparently for one another are allowed to be happy the second man has of course to suffer in life unfortunately there is always someone who has to do that mr crawford handles his subject with all his usual ease and dexterity  cecilia  never rises to any great height of emotion or excitement but it is in some ways all though more comfortable reading for that the reader with leisure to dispose of goes on steadily from page to page without skipping incessantly to know the issue of each successive entanglement with a less placid treatment this would inevitably have resulted,northamerica

a human trinity by ronald macdonald methuen os this is an interesting storyfine matter expressed finely by convincing personalities the drawing of the characters is free from all affectation and sincerely simply and especially in the case of mary frozier even beautifully handled this study of a really delightful woman is a very careful and intimate one the reader is strongly attracted to her in the first part of the book when she in her quiet studio seems at first almost only a restful background to the vivid youth of anthony le dane but in the last chapter of this part where she comes forward and takes her place beside him it is the woman who fills the picture the reader feels quite grateful to the author for the true dignified and tender treatment of the situation the beginning of the second part contains some of the most charmingly written pages of the book and deals with the fresh and pleasant youth of mary the naturalness of it is remarkable and the descriptions which give the impression of being the outcome of a vivid feeling for the subject rather than the ordered force of words are most convincing this element of intenseness gives to the writing what it lacks in actual style the author is certainly a psychologist of no mean merit and as well as the real insight into the temperament and heart of the woman whom he presents to us as so really lovable in character he gives us an interesting study of the mind of another type of woman through the medium of the unsatisfactory loveaffair between anthony and elmira corder the other characters too are drawn with the feeling of an artist and not those of a mere writer of a story although in this aspect also the book is essentially a tale tolda tale with a very interesting motive which is admirably dealt with in the telling  new novel8 a human trinity by ronald macdonald methuen  co there is only one disadvantage in mr macdonalds novel and we hardly see how it was to be avoided the story is divided into three books and the action of the second book takes place twentyfive years before the action of the first it is explanatory of the storys secret which is hardly a secret from the intelligent reader not that this matters  in fact it lends interest to the narrative to wonder how the beautiful and womanly lady mary is going to face the situation which is being gradually created for her mr macdonald is a frank writer but his frankness is justified by his delicacy of treatment the atmosphere of this tale is liberal and philosophic anthony le dane has a peculiar candour in speaking to his mother which the circumstances of their relationship excuse anthony in fine for one perilously near being a prig behaves magnificently he is one of those creatures rarely achieved in fictiona good young man who is interesting his uncle lord ingestow is of a more usual type which is generally attractive of the chief characters the celebrated explorer bethune convinces us least of all nor is it possible to us quite to forgive or explain his treatment of the girl he loved we notice an admirably drawn american man and an equally admirably drawn american woman we welcome mr macdonald in a higher role he has written a novel of tenderness and power and he must henceforth be reckoned with,northamerica
the myth of hiawatha and other oral legends mythologic and allegoric of the north ame rican indians by henry r schoolcraft lld philadelphia lippincott  co london triibner  co prof longfellow in the notes to hiawatha recognises the works of dr schoolcraft as the chief source from which his legends are taken the notoriety thus gained has moved this gentleman to reproduce with additions and in a revised form his algie researches which have been out of print for some years the peculiar opportunities which the author has enjoyed during a lengthened residence among the ojibways on an exploring expedition have not been lost he has collected a large number of the wild tales of the indians and he relates them with a simplicity which creates confidence in the accuracy of the translations made by the author and various friends named in the preface to the algie researches but not mentioned in the present work that there is a want of variety in the legends is not the fault of the author and that history and fiction are blended in them is assuredly not a circumstance peculiar to indian myths nor does it detract from their value their true interest beyond the quaint poetry which is occasionally to be traced in them is the insight which they give of indian character in them the man appears no pompous enunciator of commonplace truthsno cold abstraction of courage and enduranceas he has been represented by some novelists we see him with all his sagacity in small thingshis lack of extended vision and of the art and power of combinationhis suspicions ignorance and superstitions even hiawatha or manabozho in prose is a very different person from that hero in the poem those who have formed his acquaintance when decked in his poetical garb will be shocked to find that he is a notorious liar even among his compatriotsthat he invites his friends the birds and beasts to supper and firings their necks as they march by him at his request with their eyes shut  that he murders his hospitable friend the beaver in cold bloodand in short is hardly more respectable than his mythological brethren of greece old nohomis also in prose is said to have had a paramour in the shape of a beara strange form by the by for a lover however it might have fitly represented a married partner but while we recognise the value of these traditions as illustrations of the character of the indian they by no means possess the charm of the poetical versions during the perusal of some of them we felt to adopt the indian creed that the little servants of the great weeng the spirit of sleep were hammering at our temples in a manner that prevented our keeping our eyes open the indians admit however that these little spirits have no judgment which accounts for the sleep which occasionally overcomes them when floating above a fall or in other positions of danger and which may explain certain phenomena sometimes observed in our own churches while some are dull however others have a certain poetry of conception and strangeness of events that may amuse even after the rela j tion of the same or kindred tales by prof j longfellow but the most generally interesting portion of the book is that denominated  wild notes ofthe pibbigwun which contains some songs and small poems in the simple ideas of which though the metre and treatment are different much of the charm of the poem of hiawatha may be traced a very pretty allegory of niagara we extract an old grey man on a mountain lived he had daughters four and one and a tall bright lodge of the betula bark that glittered in the sun he lived on the very highest top for he was a hunter free where he could spy on the clearest day gleams of the distant sea 41 come out come out cried the youngest one  let us off to look at

new novels mr crewels career by winston jhurcnui macmillan  uo although american railroad politics loom large in this story the human interest is even more poignant than in previous novels by this author whose present work marks a distinct advance the text is that which forms the basis of all sympathy tout comprendre cest tout pardonner but mr churchill takes us further presenting to us a hero so sympathetic that he always imagines the best where his knowledge is incomplete we could have wished the said hero less immaculateeven one error of judgement would have brought him nearer to the ordinary human level there is some incorrectness of quotation a few slips occur in the printing  and surely the title is ill chosen the pushful crewe making reform a means for the advance of his own ambition is not the figure which will remain longest in the readers memory the author has brought us so near to what he believes to be the eve of reform in the old american system of railway politics that this novel ends as it were a period and with the period some fine types of character must to our regret disappear we are shown in these pages that they have already lingered overlong still we look forward to meeting the hero again in a new age but we fear that the new age with its greater regard for humanity may prove less virile than that with which this tale ends  mr crewes career fiction by winston churchill macmillan and co 6s we shall be greatly surprised if mr winston churchills latest novel does not have the effect of seriously offending manyif not the majorityof his fellowcountrymen let it be said at once that it is a novel of extraordinary power a novel written with an incisive force and directness that is rare in contemporary fiction unlike the metropolis it is not a mere magnified tract it is on the contrary a genuine work of art a work planned on an almost epic scale every character in which is impressed with an unmistakable individuality for this very reason it is likely to be the deadlier in its effect dedicated to  the men who in every state of the union are engaged in the struggle for purer politics this book is a scathing and unsparing indictment of american political methods mr churchill writes with a restrained fury and with something of the fervour of the prophet as he unfolds this sordid drama of fraud misgovernment and chicanery the picture is appalling in its verisimilitude we see votes bought and sold honour held but lightly and justice prostituted at the bidding of a powerful and unscrupulous interest the mr crew who gives his name to the titlehe is very far indeed from being the herois a fool with a monumental f he is the sort of man in fact of whom the shortsighted and the flatterer are apt to remark that he is veryfar indeed from being a fool we meet him first as an aspirant for congress  we leave him as an unsuccessful candidate for the senate he has allied himself with the forces of reform and has been hopelessly beaten by the stronger and abler forces of reaction but the real interest of the story lies with austen vane who is evidently meant to typify a new spirit in american politicsa spirit that may yet cleanse the augean stables of corruption to us he stands for an america that is not yet born but if mr churchill is able to discern on the political horizon a cloud no bigger than a mans hand we wish him joy of his discovery the book it should be said has a very real human interest and in victoria flint the author has created a character of unforgettable charm but for us its chief attraction lies in the presentment of a struggle between two opposing schools of politics which is seen in these pages as an aspect of the eternal duel between right and wrong the possible effect of such a book can be only dimly surmisedit may be that the warning has come too latebut mr churchill is to be heartily congratulated on his candour courage and public spirit  congratulated too on the production of one of the most engrossing novels that have been written for some considerable time,northamerica

the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,northamerica
  the white sidter by f marion crawford i i macmillan  co righmy to praise this novel from a vanished hand demands a preliminary depreciation of its plot the precipitate taking of the veil by a young lady on believing the false rumour of her lovers death is stale yet it is precisely the antiquity of marion crawfords theme which compels one to recognise with pleasant surrise the quickening power of his pen while indulging in artifices of stagecarpentry which would discredit a beginner he rescues his characters from the imminent danger they incur of stiffening into marionettes by an atmosphere of spirituality saracinesca reappears in the story and at the end acts as fairy godfather,northamerica
maru lyndon or revelations of a life an autobiography new york strange  towns i end london low  co  this is a story written by a woman as a protest against the social grievances of which as she conceives women have an especial cause of  complaintthese are the legal tyranny of husbands and the difficulty for a woman to obtain  cheap and easy divorce this being the text i it is not difficult to imagine that the authoress  makes out a strong case of special pleading j mary lyndon the heroine is a strongminded womanmany many degrees above proof  she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment  a susceptible female but out of them all  she comes forth triumphantly an  emanci pated woman offering herself as an example  and a leader to her sex for our own part we  must confess that upon closing the book we had j come round to the verdict of the sagacious old1 ham jury on the trial of a man for killing his  j wife that he had served her right most   readers will we fancy feel unfeigned compas sion for mr albert hervey who for some sin  in a previous state of existence is sentenced to become the husband of mary lyndon the authoress is not without talent but she chokes i  all sympathy in her readers by the hard arro  gant dogmatical selfcomplacency with which   she puts herself forward the book is written   in the worst style of american bad tastefull   of pedantry and fine writing the story is one j that simply told and written in a better spirit p might have been made not only interesting but profitable for it touches upon many deeply  j interesting points in the secret and social life of women but as it stands it is only redeemed from being absurd by being detestable the heroine begins with her early childhood and goes through all the miseries that can beset a child for the purpose of shoving how ignorant foolish and bigoted were all the people placed in authority over her they treat her wrong they feed her wrongthey clothe her wrong they teach her wrongand she has to find herself in every thing in fact from her own account of herself she seems to have been sent into the world like a bottle of patent medicine labelled and attested to cure every imaginable female complaint social or physical dissatisfied with the religious teaching she receives from her parents she becomes a quaker and going to visit some quaker friends she receives an offer from a man to whom she conceives a violent antipathy at first sight and accepts him her account of the matter is that  his friends pleaded and besought her to marry him and m  a whirl of persuasions that literally made me dizzy i consentedmy time was well nigh come when fate met me in the path of life and i fell on my face and worshipped a young man such as i had seen in my daydreams was introduced to me by hervey i lovedand i awoke to the consciousness of living death the hours i spent with my friend whose sphere was a constant beneficence to me were whitewinged moments such as make our ideal of heaven my heart sprang to him as the flower lifts its petals to the warm sunlight in spite of this she keeps her engagement and marries herveyand  does her duty by him in a style that would make any husbands blood curdle in his veins at the prospect of what might have been his lot had the gods given him such a wife she of course as a pendant to her own portrait as a model wife and victim paints her husband in conjugal colours that rival the superfluous blackness of an illustrious personage who must not be named to ears polite after a while she separates from him gives lectures at a lyceum and takes up a highly platonic attachment to an exquisite transcendentalist  with a face fair and beautiful as a babes his complexion was the rose and lily shining through a skin that was the transparent medium of hereditary scrofulahe stood radiant as the rose and pearl of a seashellthe blessed moon raining her silver sheen on his waving and golden hairhis broad forehead shining with unearthly lustrehis beaming eyes looking up as if in most calm and wise and loving worshipi said  i hope you have had a pleasant evening all evenings he replied are pleasant in the depths of being when we feel our oneness with the infinite c c the conversation continues much longer in a similar strainhe looking into her being with the spell of a sweet and serene strength mesmerises her we suppose as she adds calmly and silently i seemed to settle into the inmost of my life till i rested as on the downy bosom of bliss this remarkable man dies the ladys husband wishes her to return to him but she declines as it would hurt her conscience to be a legal harlot she therefore remains a sad separate wife emancipates herself at last from all the limited liabilities of the female sex and takes a regular degree as a homoeopathic physician practising the watercure also by which she obtains at length money fame and strangely enough respectability she blooms out also into a celebrated authoress and discovers in a highly distinguished editor the ideal husband who would be necessary to the completion of her moral being and after the interchange of more than a hundred pages of love letters which are all given at full length finally she resolves to obtain a divorce if she can from her husband and if she cannot to live with the man of her choice as his wife without the legal sanction however to save the punctuaties as the chinese call them the original husband applies for a divorce and she telling mr vincent that if her love should ever lead her from him she must go and making a few other stipulations consents to appoint a day for the ceremonyand the book concludes amid the same profusion of fine words and selfcomplacent arrogance which prevail in the beginning if women can only be emancipated at such a cost of all that is pure lovely and of good reportof all that has ever been regarded as having  any virtue or any praiseboth men and women will we

the algonquin legends of new england b charles g leland sampson low  co when mr leland offers from the mic mac a tale partly in blank verse as far as form goes and in plot a mixture of the french tale of the bears son and the conclusion of the scotch 4 nicht nocht nothing one feels at first as if things were not all as they should be in mic mac this story is styled  the three strong men  pp 311 323 in the narrative comes a sevenheadti devil one of the beings so familiar in slavonic miirchen then the critic turns back to p 207 where mr leland tells him that  this srheaded son  of hymer in the vafthrudnismal reappears as a demon in the passamaquoddy tale of  the three strong men whatever may be the case in passamaquoddy certainly in mic mac the demon is sevenheaded then rises the question why should the seven  headed or sixheaded in passamaquoddy demon be the sixheaded son of hymer of the  vafthrudnismal why indeed  we cannot answer the question though we feel certain that the mic mac story is a compound of two stories which are european though also found more or less in malagasy mr leland himself admits part of this the story consists of a very old indian legend mingled with a european fairy tale drawn through a french canadian source but what part of the tale is very old indian  the original mr leland says  is from beginning to end a song or poem that is why we presume he has rendered so much of it into blank verse printed as prose in the tale the hero loses his memory and forgets his bride when his hand is licked by a black dog this is the celtic idea of the man who was to let no one kiss him and who lost all memory of the past when  kissed  by a dog we fail to see what is indian in the whole tale except perhaps mention of wigwams and the like now if this tale be so notably european though already converted into a kind of chant by the mic macs and if the norse identifications p 207 be so far from convincing to a moderate scepticism the rest of mr lelands collection is also not likely to be accepted without shyness he is perhaps chiefly interested himself in the resemblances between the tricky lox of passamaquoddy and the tricky loki of scandinavian myth the resemblances are often strong but would be stronger if for example mr leland offered p 271 any proof that  the fellow who played the trick a trick very like one of lokiswas lox he says  we may very easily detect the hand of lox the mischiefmaker in this last incident but lox has never been mentioned or hinted at in the tale mr leland may he right but every one must decide for himself as to the plausibility of the conjecture mr leland thinks that a good deal of eddaic lore has filtered through the eskimo to the algonquins and certainly many curious coincidences in eddaic and indian folklore may be accounted for by that hypothesis though we are not yet convinced of its accuracy perhaps for complete proof other examples of indian institutions dress weapons gear of every kind derived from norsemen might be adduced they would certainly strengthen the hypothesis one story which represents  master rabbit as originally the possessor of a long tail will at once suggest  brer babbit did the negroes borrow this incident from the indians or the indians from the negroes or did both invent it separately or did both derive it from a common source  these are questions which it is all but impossible to answer many of the negro rabbit tales have been brought from africa where they were told about a beast not very unlike a rabbit superficially perhaps others have been borrowed from indian sources on all these points it is hard or rather it ought to be impossibleto dogmatize at present we confess that after reading all mr lelands talesvery good tales very well told  we are slightly inclined not to believe in scandinavian influence on the algonquin legends the evidence and inferences are evenly balanced and perhaps it is only the hardness of the mythological heart that resists in any case mr lelands book though we wish he had avoided blank verse is extremely interesting and valuable both in itself and in its probable effects other american collectors of the red mens legends will be encouraged we hope to publish them as literally as possible this is the great point already we knew from schoolcraft and others that the red mens tales resemble and in fact are variants of the european marchen how much of this likeness is due to scandinavian and more recent french and english influences that is precisely the question which at present it is impossible to answer but which many readers of mr lelands book will reply to by voting for an infiltration of the edda only he himself can state his case at sufficient length and with his own evidence so to algonquin legends we send the mythologist no abstract can or should satisfy him,northamerica
john halifax gentleman by the author of the head of the family c 3 vols hurst ft blackettjohn halifax is an improvement on the last novel by the same author of plot there is not much but there is a design which is followed without haste and without weariness john halifax the hero is intended to be the type of a man who from the lowest depths of destitution works his way up to fortune and a position in society there are many such men more than the world ever heard ofbut john halifax cannot be accepted as the type of such he is too much idealized a boy who begins by being a farm servant until he is fourteen and who then is employed in a tanyard to fetch the skins from market might possess all the fine characteristics bestowed on john halifaxhis selfreliance his energy his integrity his passion for selfimprovementbut he would nothe could notattain the bearing and manners of a fine gentleman he could not by mere effort of selfculture attain the tone of good society the real men who have raised themselves from nothing polish as they rise and as their intercourse with persons of breeding and education extendsthat is if they have an innate refinement of their own otherwise they remain coarse and unpolished at the end as at the beginning amongst the orientals the conventional manners of the great and those of the meanest are of the same qualitya watercarrier or a donkeydriver may dine with a grand vizier without shocking any of the external punctualities but in england it is different and john halifax is made producible in a drawingroom without ever having seen any one better than himself this is the mistake of the book  the authoress has been too anxious to make her hero perfect and has by so doing thrown a fictitious rosecoloured tint over a character that could have dispensed with any such aid the story is however interesting the attachment between john halifax and his wife is beautifully painted as are the pictures of their domestic life and the growing up of the children the strife between the two brothers when they discover they are each attached to the same object is vigorously drawn and the conclusion of the book is beautiful and touching there is a blind child muriel very prettily done but she might have died earlier with advantage to the bookher part is too long drawn out the friendship between john halifax and phineas fleoher is well managed and opens a source of interest and emotion which we wonder is not oftener and more efficiently used in novels friendship has capabilities of interest quite as deep and as universal as love only it requires more knowledge to handle it nobly and adequately  fiction ai ijohn hlalifax gentleman by the author of the i s  a s head of the family c a new edition reviseu london hurst and blackett  this was miss mulochs last and best novel it obtained an immediate and deserved popularity insor much that the publishers have been tempted to give to it the rare honour of a reissue in a single volume at a small price so that all who have not vet enjoyed the reading of it may do so without borrowing it for it is one of those books which mav be put upon the shelf for permanent preservation it is not one of the novels of the season but a fiction of enduring worth  polit halilfax gentleman by the author of  the head  of the family  olive c c three vols hurst and blackett this is a very good and a very interesting novel its faults are but excesses in a certain kind of merit and arise out of full occupation of the author in the subject and a rare intensity of purpose perhaps its two chief merits maiy admit of being reckoned as a fault it is designed to trace the career from boyhood to age of a perfect man a christian gentleman and it abounds in incident both well and highly wrought but the carrying of such a hero through a lifelong series of trials and showing him in each heroical suggests impossible perfection john halifax is indeed much such a hero to his author as was thaddous of warsaw to miss porter with the one favourable szceptiou that although he is representd as a godlike man h is wi ontialwlyis not once evendirectly honoured with that this john appears first as a boy of unknown parentage fiked up out of the streets yet not without so much concesion pid to claims of blood as to leave some indication of his rwing gentle born he is picked up by a quaker tanner and obfl into friendship by the quakers crippled son phineas fletcher the same who in his old age is supposed to be the writer of this his instructive history john is a perfect servant and a perfect friend he errs once only when out of the perfection and strength of his expanding intellect and isehood and before falling in love he allows a yearning for action beyond the sphere of the tanyard in a country villge to carry him with his friend phineas to the next town to see a play but for that escapade he atones by submitting to the displeasure of his master and by obeying so well t order to see no more of his friend as not to come near him for two whole years at the end of which time he has more than redeemed his character as a youth he quells rioters by christian conduct and is the best guardian of his masters property he falls in love and is the most highmindea of lovers then he becomes a model husband then a model father and afterwards prospering in life he becomes a model master model neighbour model landowner and squire in every relation he is sorely tried apparently by every form of trial that the author could invent and by each in an exceedingly severe form but out of every trial john halifax gentleman rises sublime his later trials are all born for many years under the dispensation of a heart disease angina pectoris which is brought on by violent emotion and always at risk of life when his last troubles are over and except the one child in the churchyard all are happy his disease proves fatal and his faithful wife nestles against his corpse and dies now whatever fault there is in such a book as this arises as we have said out of the very worthiness and earnestness of its design but conceding its obvious defects we have to say that throughout it is conceived in a high spirit and written with great abilitybetter than any former work we think of its deservedly successful author there is much delicate pathos there are charming touches of nature scattered about there are many picturesmoor scenes bome scenes scenes of lovers in the beech wood or of the death of the beloved in the quiet chamberrepresented with great truth the picture of the two friends in youth the manly and strong john halifax the wealthy phineas is new in many of its features and not new only but beautiful the general tone of the novel we may show by one quotation john halifax has lost his first and dearest daughter the blind muriel shortly before whose death another daughter had been born and though the author has felt too much the pathos of muriel in her story and dwelled on it too long still for all that it is pathos john went early to the room upstairp it was very still ursula lay calmly asleep with baby maud in her bosom on her other side with yes wide open to the

macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the heartstruggles of the two heroines to show what female selfsacrifice can do to advocate female education and to portray the indomitable spirit of the south in the present struggle are objects which the author has had continually in view dr arnold a medical gentleman of the seriocomic style is a consistent character and his eccentricities afford a good deal of amusement,northamerica
  a little traitor to the south by cyrus i townsend brady macmillan co american novels according to the present fashion are not complete without a bit of history mr brady describes his little book very well as a wartime comedy with a tragic interlude this interlude contains the true story of a daring exploit in which seven southerners lost their lives on board a sort of submarine torpedo boat after succeeding in blowing up one of the enemys vessels the exploit is related with spirit and is very cleverly worked into the lovestory which furnishes the comedy the comedy at the end is perhaps a little overdone but mr brady compresses the whole thing into a reasonable space and mixes grave and gay so as to furnish a highly agreeable story which is both exciting and amusing,northamerica

into mr bonns ppular shilling series was to exhibit in a succession of scenes more attractively and graphically than is possible in the more formal shape of a travellers narrative  moorislh manners customs history and geography and moonrsl life as it actually is in barbary in the present day and not as it usually appears amid the vague and poetic glamour of the common moorish romance the lcrber is an historical tale not merely having a foundation in fact but not widely departing from it nevertheless it is as wild and strange and full of an absorbing interest as any romance we ever read adding another confirmation to the proverb that  truth is stranger than fiction the writing is vigorous and at times even brilliant and thus in this singularly cheap volume we have at once the pleasure of a romance and the profit of pictures by a person intimately acquainted with the aspect and the people of a country of which very little is knowu to us  the berber or the mountaineer of the atlas a tale of the sallee hovers by william starbuck mayo md author of  kaloolah bentley dr mayo is evidently afraid of the author of  kaloolah as a piece of grave exaggeration a wellsustained satire on the american practice of marvellous taletellingwe held and hold that romance to be unrivalled we admire the size of the writers lions the length of his boaconstrictors the magnificence of his cities and the splendour of his african kingsthe grandeur and originality of his whole system of pennyalining and we enjoyed more than one hearty laugh at the satirefor the magniloquent descriptions were more than relieved by slight touches of pathos and humour but the authors genius for quiet caricature appears to have well nigh exhausted itself in his first effortby the side of  kaloolah the  berber  pales its ineffectual fire the materials of the story are here much the same as in the former case this time the distressed and captured damsels are spaniards and christians their lovers areone a bold and famous pirate with the sound of whose dreaded name andalusian mothers frighten their refractory infants  the other a yet more famous chieftain of the berber tribe a white man and a christian who is trying to introduce the religion and civilization of europe into the mountain ranges of the atlas a medley of jews arabs moors and berbers make up the remainder ofthe dramatis personaan historical personage  muley ismael sultan of morocco plays a leading part in the story but the interest chiefly clings to the berber chief with his grand notions and inchoate reformations the tale is too crowded with incident and adventure for us to attempt to give even its outlines we shall therefore content ourselves with presenting an extract or two and leaving them to tell their own tale the following passage brings forward the despotand a message to him from the hero  it was morning at mequinez in a large court communicating with the garden of the hareem were assembled all the dignitaries of the court a body of black troops lined each side of the square four stalwart negroes lounged at a little distance from the archway by which the soltan was expected to enter these were the executioners the invariable attendants at a  meshourah or royal audience who at a look from their master could seize the unfortunate subject of the monarchs wrath and tossing him into the air let him fall so as to break any prescribed number of bones or to kill him outright in front of the areli were gathered the officers of the court the chief dignitaries of the city mingled with kaids and lieutenantkaids from morocco and fez and bashaws from the provinces of soos and tefilet at a little distance a group of four or five jews in black sk ulcap and bornoose cowered in deprecating attitude beneath the fierce looks of the negro guard a striking contrast was that lie i ween the insolent air of these black barbarians from the further side of the sahara and the subdueel voices and anxious looks of the maroquien courtiers  may god prolong the life of the soltan whispered a bashaw to the kaid of the gate  hast thou heard in what mood it has pleased his majesty to rise this morning  may the soltans life be prolonged replied the kaid  a eunuch just whispered me that it had pleased our lord the shereef to rise with his sword in his teeth and the word passed through the groups of anxious officials that something had gone wrong with his majesty during the night and that probably more than one head would roll from its shoulders in token of the soltans displeasure    long life and health to sidi may god preserve sidi shouted with one accord the courtiers at the same time prostrating themselves to the ground and crouching and cringing around the soltan endeavouring to touch his feet or to kiss his garments or the trappings of his horse the soltan however kept his horse in motion and his cimeter whirling and it was with no small expenditure of agility that his courtiers contrived to pay their customary salutations and yet to preserve their bodies from the horses hoofs or their necks from the steel as it was several turbans were already cut through and a dozen haicks were stained with blood when suddenly the soltan checked his horse and sheathing his cimeter with a growl of rage he passed his hands into the folds of his sash and drew out a paper  traitors he shouted glaring round upon his panting and terrified court  dogs whose work is this  who of you has dared to sell himself to the berber and the old monarch shook the paper with convulsive energy  read this he exclaimed to an officer who held the office of chief kaid of the gate the kaid advanced took the paper and alter kissing the hem of the imperial haick he read in a loud voice as follows to the powerful muley ismael emperor of morocco soos and tefilet whom god preserve in the paths of justice and mercy know that thy demand for more tribute than the free amazerg of the hills has of his own accord consented to pay is unjust know also that thy design to ravage the country of the ait amoor is known to me be warned in time and let there be peace between us i fear you not and wish you well in token whereof i pin this paper with my dagger to your pillow and not to your heart casbin el subah j i 1 what think you demanded the soltan when  i the kaid had finished   whence comes this who pinned that paper to my pillow  may god for ever preserve sidi but i know not replied the trembling kaid think you it was the berber chieftain himselfgod knows replied the kaid falling upon his knees god knows but you do not growled the soltan and yet you are kaid of the gatesmuley ishmael glared around upon his court with the look of a tiger selecting a victim and then raising his finger the four negroes darted upon the prostrate and grovelling form of the unfortunate officer  god is great and there i9 no god but god may he lengthen the life of sidi exclaimed the kaid but with the words in his mouth his body was whirled aloft on the extended arms ofthe gigantic negroes and then dashed head first with mortal loree upon the marble pavement the soltan stared lora moment with a grin of maniacal rage distorting his toothless mouth upon the lifeless body of the kaid while courtiers began to elevate their voices in expressions of admiration of his justice and goodness and in wishes for his long life and prosperity one moor however of a dignified mien and of ti complexion that would have compared for clearness and whiteness with that of the inhabitants of northern europe stood a little apart in silence he either could not or would not join in the sycophantic plaudits that were beginning to arise from all quarters of the court as the eyes of the monarch turned from the body of the kaid they fell upon the silent figure of the moor  hah  exclaimed the soltan  abdallah ibn asken  what thinkest thou of the justice of the shereef  to approve or disapprove in answer to such a question it was well known to lie attended with equal danger and for a moment abdallah stood without making any reply with a deepdrawn yell of concentrated passion muley ishmael spurred towards him  dog son of a christian you a descendant of the ommeyah of andalusia  he shouted and raising his sword let it fall with full force upon the head of the moor who as the blade descended received it without moving from his tracks luckily the thick turban afforded a partial defence but still the keen steel cleft the scalp and glancing inflicted a deep wound in the shoulder the sword itself by the force of the blow was wrenched from the soltans hand and flew out some distance on the pavement quietly abdallah turned took a few steps picked up the sword and deliberately wiped the bloody blade upon his haik isle then advanced to the emperor who sat motionless upon his horse and presenting the hilt bowed his head god is ged exclaimed abdallahand i submit to my fate at his hands and at the hands of the sherecf muley ismael although one of the most suspicious irritable and cruel tyrants that ever filled a throne had his moments of generosity from the extreme of passion it was no uncommon thing for him to pass to the extreme of kindness and condescension receiving the cimeter he returned it to its sheath and then unbuckling the belt handed it back to abdallah  receive this said the soltan oh worthy descendant of the royal ommeyah may god restore their dynasty to the throne of cordovareceive it as a token of our satisfaction that there is at least one brave and honest man in our court abdallah bowed himself to the stirrup of the soltan and kissed his foot muley ishmael placed his hand upon the moors head and raising it exclaimed in a loud voice long life to abdallah ibn asken chief kaid of the gates as historical heresy is the fashion of the times dr mayo asserts his right to dispute the old traditions of conquest mr disraeli has done his best to prove the intellectual preponderance of the mosaic arabsmr urquhart claimed a similar supremacy in mind and prowess for the saracensand now dr mayo comes forward to support the claims of the berbers that a civilised and noble people did once inhabit the southern provinces of spain is pretty certain and our author contends that the heroes and statesmen the poets and architects of seville and cordovathe warriors who routed alfonzo on the battlefield of zalaca and those who riotously swept the country up to the very mountains of asturiaswere not of arab but of berber origin we have no doubt that the american author could maintain his theory with as much plausibility as his european rivals do theirs but we have not space to discuss questions of history with the romancer he is more at home in his own element of marvels and masquerades heroes are always heroeseven in their teens and of course the mountaineer of the atlas performed exploits in his youth the sheik of arbazza was a shereef and a saint began the rais in a low but distinct voice he was of a pure arabic stock and n bitter hater of the berbers he was also the wealthiest man in all the kingdom of fez and among his riches he possessed one thing that he valued more than all the rest a mare of the most famous blood of duquella her pedigree could be traced back for ages and the fame of her beauty and her speed filled the whole land she was a thoroughbred deafener and winddrinker she was as the apple of his eye anil proud was the sheik of arbazza that he was the owner of a creature that for beauty fire speed and endurance could not be matched travel the world over the sheik of arbazza was at feud with several of his neighbours both of plain and hill and numerous attempts were made by his enemies and if the truth must be told by several of his friends to dispossess him of his favourite but the sheik was a wary man and vain were all the efforts of treacherous friends and open enemies he was also a boastful and an arrogant man and he prided himself not a little on his ability to defeat anel punish any attempt to carry off the descendant of the famous maha el pahr or steed of the sea already had several gallant and adventurous spirits perished and more had failed and been driven hack in disgrace when the vanity of the sheik slipped the bridle of prudence and gallopped ott with him without cheek or restraint he published an invitation to all who felt disposed to steal his famous mare he announced a defiance to the boldest and most adroit horsestealers in all the empire he even offered in his vain sense of security a reward of a thousand gold metzcals to whoever should succeed in earning off el ilassaneh or the beautiful of course after this the watchfulness of the sheik was not relaxed or los precautions decreased each night the mare was picketted by the door of his tent one end of an iron chain was put around her leg and locked and the key deposited in the sheiks girdle the other end of the chain was brought within the tent passed under the sheiks bed and fastened to the tent pole within reach of his hand stood his loaded gun the match always burningand the sheik was the most famous marksman of the tribes without the tent a pack of the largest and fiercest dogs threatened every intruder with instant death among the enemies of the sheik the principal one consisted of a portion of the beni mozarg and of course nothing would have delighted the berbers more than for one of their number to have achieved the feat of carrying off the sheiks famous mare on though one hand was every inducement to attempt the adventurepride revenge the love of glory and an admiration of horseflesh but on the other hand there were too many obstacles in the waythe distance to the plains the difficulty of approaching the dounh the canine guards the chain and more than ali the watchfulness and prowess of the sheik these obstacles had been found by repeated experiments insurmountable and the very bravado ofthe sheik while it was looked upon as the worst of insults helped to deter the boldest of thc berbers from undertaking the adventure at that time casbin son of the amekran of the beni mozarg was scarce turned of thirteen hut already had he killed the king of beasts and acquired the name of el subah or the lion it was noticed that the young prince was for days busy in constructing a strong basket or rather cage the holes in it were just wide enough to admit a hounds nose and the withes were of the stoutest kind and wound with strips of untanned hide the basket excited much curiosity but not a word did the young chieftain vouchsafe as to the purpose to which it was to be applied but great i waa the surprise when catching a common cat he enclosed her in the basket and securely i7t i  door it was in a terrible storm of snow thfisl is with his cage and cat strapped behind bisl ft out secretly from the kassir towards3li reached the low land and

wholly engrossed bi the cat they thrust the points of their noses inti the meshes of the basket they rolled it over aid over they shook it and tried to pull it to pieceswhh their paws and teeth they fought with each other in their eagerness for a bite they had no etti ears noses or mouths for any thing except the cat making a detour casbin came upon the tent foo the other side at a proper distance he slipped from his horse secured him in a moment and advanced to the tent slowly noiselessly with his breast to the ground the young prince crept up and put hu head in under the curtain all was dark save a fiuv glimmer that came from the womens apartment the sheik was asleep casbin drew his body into the tent the first thing he did was to feel for the gun which he noiselessly emptied of the ball and replaced in its position he then drew his knife and stretching himself by the side of the sheik deliberately began cutting through his woollen sash firs on one side and then on the other the slumber of the sheik were far from sound but so quietly and skilfully was the operation conducted that hews not awakened nor any alarm given to the other inmates of the tent the front turns of the sash were lifted from the sleeper upon running his hand through the folds casbin lighted at once upon the key the most difficult part of the adventure was achieved casbin stuck his dagger in the ground ia front of the sheiks face and as slowly and as noelessly as before crept under the door curtain of the tent there stood the noble animal el hamnth the beautiful the rain had ceased the clouds had suddenly broken away and the bright starlight mingled with the first faint sheen of dawn revealed her beautiful proportions to the young prince but not long did he tarry to admire he took one look to make sure that it was indeed she the muchpraised and oftdescribed beauty and then applying the key to the padlock liberated her foot from the chain he threw over her head a hempen bridli he freed her fetlocks from the cords by which she was picketted he vaulted on her back oh sheik ali shouted the youth come forth and bid adieu to your favourite no answer wo returned and casbin springing lightly to the ground seized the end of the chain and giving it a vigorous shake vaulted again to the back of el hassaneh come forth oh most arrogant sheik of arbazza shouted casbin  your mare will not leave you without returning you thanks for your favours the curtain ofthe tent was thrown violently aside one glance showed to the horrorstricken sheik hil favourite freed from her chain and with some one on her back he hesitated not an instant with a groan of rage he raised his gun to his shoulder and fired what was his astonishment to find that the audacious rider still preserved his seat the report of the gun and the burst of boyish laughter that followed it aroused all the inhabitants of the down the arabs came pouring out of their tents obmost renowned sheik cried the prince  thou

heathcote of gangoil harry harry hcathcotc of gangoil a tale of australian bush lift by anthony trollope low and co this novel of mr trollopes possesses the double merit of being short and extremely interesting but ws should think lbe would have encountered some difficulty if he had tried to get it published under the auspices of an emigration agency it professes to give a faithful picture of the society of the queensland  bush and of the struggle for existence among the various members of that society which although limited is still sufficiently   ci a naynniqt1ie interests the five drin large to contain antagonistic interests the five principal elements that take an active part in mr trollopes story are squatters freeselectors hired workmen thieves and mosquitos of these the mosquitos are the only animated creatures that seem thoroughly to enjoy life next to them come the thieves whose policy it seems to be to squat on a small leasehold property and to make that a basis of operations for stealing the sheep and cattle of their neighbours the danger of detection and imprisonment or hanging is a certain drawback to the charms of this easy life but that is so slight in a thinly peopled country that the squatter whose notions of property are primitive and elementary as those of paleys pigeon might be ideally happy but for his rivals the mosquitos when however we ascend in the scale of queensland society we have a painful illustration of the cares of greatness and of the advantages for happiness possessed by those at the bottom of the ladder as mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,northamerica
  the making of a man by e h lacon watson brown langham  co the plot of this novel is conventionally melodramatic but the treatment is quiet effective and workmanlike it suggests the work of a good craftsman tired or too indifferent to give himself the trouble of thinking out a good plot the habit of thought and of analysis persists and consequently in this book one finds some thoughtful passages and some very fair characterdrawing though the whole considered as a novel is indifferent the writer should be capable of something a good deal better half the story is concerned with the country somewhere in the shires the other half with bohemian life in london largely in the temple  the making of a man bv e h lacon witcou os brown langham mr lacon watsons new novel is concerned with the making of at least one man and the unmaking of two the man who is made is jack sugden the son of a kindly and delightfully whimsical country parson he goes to london to study for the bar on such small allowance as his father can manage to scrape together for him and when his father is overtaken by misfortunes that will not permit of his continuing his generosity jack having plenty of pluck and being inspiringly in love contrives to struggle through to success almost unaided the end which puts an end to the only two unpleasant persons in the book dr henderson and the insufferable poet march is rather too violent and melodramatic otherwise the characterisation is excellent and the stori is told reticently with a quiet realism and is full of interest mr lacon watson has an easy lucid style that makes admirable reading,northamerica
fiction the custom of the country utl1  s  by edith i   vvnarton piacmnuan  uo the modem american young woman with her wondrous selfassurance her arrogance towards the male creatures who support her and her physical perfections has often been portrayed in fiction but it has been left to mrs wharton to expound her whole significance in  the custom of the countrv we are introduced to a state of society as chaotic crude and purely imitative as that of hayti or liberia but full of force and held together by a curious patriotism from this strange soil there rises like a flower undine spragg whose history is the subject of the book the daughter of a leading citizen of apex undine was engaged while yet a child to a young dentist of that city and ran away about the same time with one elmer moffatt an adventurer whom she married and divorced in a fortnight all this was no more detrimental to her maiden pride than water on a ducks back she had quite forgotten the adventure by the time her parents on a rise of fortune moved to new york to a splendid suite in the stentorian hotel she married into one of the best oldfashioned new york families not mentioning her previous marriage and divorce but the real aristocracy of her new relatives soon disgusted her attracted by the vulgar splendour of some millionaires she made decided overtures to one of them forsook her child divorced her husband but for once miscalculated the millionaire for reasons of his own declined to marry her and she retired to paris in a state of temporary disillusionment reviving presently she married a french count and in the course of time divorced him when she finally joined hands with the same elmer moffattnow a multimillionairewith whom she had eloped from apex city in her teens it is of course a monstrous record from the sentimental standpoint but mirs wharton by avoiding the least hint of sentiment and laying stress upon the sequence of environment upbringing character has made her heroine a natural and pathetic figure she succeeds in winning for a cold and selfish character the kindly sympathy which comes of understandingan achievement of which any novelist might well be proud undine spragg is always striving for the best obtainable as she conceives it it is her misfortune that her aims are all material and egotistic no sooner has she attained a social height than her minds eye discerns another yet more radiant and desirable this explains her strange inconstancy in the married state she has no scruples fails to see how any one on earth can justly blame her for discarding men who do not give her everything she wants with the readiness her father showed for abner e spragg whose  private rule of conduct was as simple as his business morality was complicated and whose lips were often  busy with a phantom toothpick had served her will at home   why havent we taught our women to take an interest in our work   inquires a cynical observer in the book simply because we dont take enough interest in them the slaving is no argument against the indifference to slave for women is part of the old american tradition lots of people give their lives for dogmas they ve ceased to believe in then again in this country the passion for making money has preceded the knowing how to spend it and the american man lavishes his fortune on his wife because he does not know what else to do with it  where does the real life of most american men lie in some womans drawingroom or in their offices  the passage is suggestive of a curious parallel between the freest of all women and circassian pets when on the last page of the book undine learned that as a woman who had been divorced she could not hope to be ambassadress in london she burst into an angry laugh and the blood flamed up into her face  i never heard of anything so insulting she cried as if the rule had been invented to humiliate her the cry rings truly of the spoilt circassian mrs whartons latest work is no mere entertaining story it is a courageous and at the same time sympathetic study of americans  notes on novels  these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser the country is japan on which mrs fraser is known to be an authority in this volume are tales of new japan all with enchanting backgrounds tokyo is a garden says for example the author in the first of them in which a city has grown up by accident and the flowers have the best of it still in the foreground is the stormy play of passions mrs fraser can handle her pen as indeed a sister of mr marion crawford should hutchinson 6s  the custom of the country by edith wharton 6s macmillan the heroine of this american tale is a muchmarried person undine spragg finally weds a man to whom as a girl she had been married clandestinely and from whom she had been separated forcibly by her parents then the second husband came on the scene marriage for him turns out to be a tragedy he commits suicide when undine deserts him a french nobleman is the ladys next husband and finally mr moffatt who is now a wealthy man mrs wvhartons irony calls this rapid mating the custom of her country but she is too fine an artist to exaggerate the point one of the notable features in her novel is the artistic restraint she has shown on two occasions she depicts the troubles inflicted by this divorcecustom upon the child but the pathos is not overdrawn again she draws with admirable skill the parents of undine people who have made money rapidly and come to new york in order to let their daughter get into society the description of mrs spraggs loneliness in the new york hotel of her pathetic isolation and helplessness is one of the best things in the story but it is written without overcolouring mrs wharton uses these scenes and situations in order to bring out the character of her heroine and the characterisation is subtle clever and convincing it is an unlovely plot nmrs wharton does not conceal the inner misery of a woman who is inferior to all the men she marries thanks to her greedy love of pleasure but no moral is drawn the story is left to tell its own warning it is this which makes it effective there is less bitterness than in  the house of mlirtlh though the situation is practically the same but the subordination of the satire to the artistic construction of the tale is equally prominent hardly any of mrs whartons recent novels displays quite such unity and penetration as this incisive study of the modern american woman of fashion  the custom of the country by mrs hugh fraser hutchinson 6s it was inevitable that mrs hugh fraser having made some reputation with a diplomatists wife in japan should forthwith collect some short stories and republish them as a book but it is a uttle unfair since there is no outward indication that the volume is made up of five tales and that  the custom of the country  is the title of only one of them and that not the first it is also rather a pity mrs fraser as she has shown us in her earlier work knows japan weu sympathises with its people and is we use the phrase in a compumentary sense an agreeable rattle but these qualities though they suffice for a couple of volumes of observant gossip are not enough for the building of one good short story mrs fraser to teu the truth does not play the game she breaks the rules with an insouciance which almost disarms criticism we will take an example from the titlestory we are sitting with thornton the hero on a balcony watching the father and uncle of the japanese girl whom he loves they are talking confidentially in the opposite house and thornton and we want to know what they are saying obviously thornton and we should learn no more than we can hear or see this is how mrs hugh fraser cheats at the game 44 but now rinzo san he said  wiu you not ask me why i came  44 for a good and brotherly purpose i ana sure replied the other trying to look unconcerned and filling up the teacups with a trembling hand  for a better purpose than yours was when you left us said his brother 441 come to undo the wrong you did and to offer ybu reconciliation and friendship from all the family 44 what am i to pay for such precious things kato san p  asked rinzo eying him suspiciously and stroking his cbio such an offer from such a quarter seemed more duvgnous than a threat 44 there is nothing to pay between brothers kato spoke as loftily as confucius could have done 44 there will be his hotel bill thought old rinzo but then ht was comforted fur kato evidently wanted something and was disposed to be polite about it the points we have italicised could not possibly have been observed by a stranger sitting on the balcony opposite mrs fraser must really learn the rules and stick to them for the breach that may pass in a novel is blatant in the short story further we would beg her not to use praughfas the past tense of  preach even in fun and finally we must point out that even if there were such a word as  anthrophoby an  anthrophobic woman could not denote a female who disliked men those who know nothing of the elements should not try to coin words  fiction american divorce i the custom of the country by edith wharton macmillan and co 6s a dmirers of mrs edith whartons books have no need to be told that any story bearing her name is sure to possess many remarkably good passages that the style is excellent and that the author knows well how to illustrate and adorn her theme yet in spite of all the custom of the country cannot be said to be a great success as a novel there is a purpose in the story a by no means undesirable and probably a necessary one but the reader feels that at times it very nearly overrides the story itself which in a novel is an error easy american divorce is the theme mrs wharton has chosen and undine spragg a beautiful girl of plebeian origin is the one upon whom the author has fixed to show the horribleness and evils of the diabolical system allowed by some of the american states it may be that undine is a type of woman evolved by the artificial surroundings of a debased society but it seems almost incredible that any society or any training could make even an american woman so heartless and callous a creature as undine is represented to be she is beautiful certainly but that is all she is never presented as a fascinating woman yet she has in her trainafter her first runaway marriage of a fortnights durationa man belonging to one of new yorks oldest and best families ralph marvell whose wife she becomes peter van degen the vulgar husband of ralphs cousin a young french marquis of old family her third matrimonial ventureand her girlhoods husband who eventually becomes her last the courtship period in each case is passed over very lightly it is with the married life and the break in each case that the book is concerned and these periods are admirably dealt with ralph and the french aristocrat have much in common each is guided by custom traditions and high honour in their private and public lifeobservances which the young american beauty never for a moment grasps or understands the only intuition she possesses is to further her own aggrandisement although she pathetically just misses her desired goal every time after doing her best to ruin the two families into which she marries she at last finds her level with her first husband now more than a millionaire thus the end of undines ventures is reached so far as the reader is allowed to know of them that the book has interest no one will deny and if it does nothing else it serves to show the scandalous state of the american divorce laws although mrs whartons purpose would have been better served had she presented a character in which the reader could more easily have believed,northamerica

the auction block by rex bcach 6s hodder  stoughton this is in some ways the best story mr rex beach has yet given us it breaks new ground and instead of carrying us away as is usual with him into the outlands on the verge of civilisation it unfolds a vivid and very human story of modern new york loreli knight the beautiful country girl whose brother and parents secure an engagement for her in a fashionable theatre with the avowed intention of seeing that she captures a millionaire husband who can be made to maintain them all is admirably portrayed and the narrative of her experiences among the richest and fastest of new yorks rich and fast set is varied picturesque and literally alive with interest so set about with snares and temptations loreli preserves a charm and force of character that enable her to win through to an end that is sharply and beautifully in contrast with the unideal life from which she at last emerges the realism of the book is good so too is the romance of it there is plenty of sensation and excitement but nothing is pleasanter in it perhaps than the human note that sounds through all the story and dominates its closing chapters she was a wife   another possessed her from the auction block by rex beach hodder  stoughton  the auction block tt j j  by rex beach hodder  stoughton 6s  tim auction block  has real power it is a study of luxurious living in new york and it shows the inner working of the rich mans insatiate thirst for pleasure satisfiedor rather maintainedby the wildest extravagance in festivities night rioting drink of the utmost variety and extent and women who go more than halfway to meet the desires which alone can give them some joy or at least excitement as well as livelihood the story has as its chief thread the career of one particular girl who marries the son of a wealthy man breaks him of his habit of drink and stimulates him to work and become prosperous in spite of the poverty imposed upon him by his parents wrath eventually reconciliation with the parents is effected but it is the writer of the story who brings this to pass rather than any genuine and natural development indeed this chief thread has no real importance for the reader as compared with the picture given of a state of society appalling in its corruption the society is that touched upon in  the jungle and it deserves studynay exacts it we talk about civilization progress reform and the like  but these are mere catchwords in the face of unlimited wealth and the unbounded raw appetites which it serves any book which exposes the problem of this world clearly and fearlessly is of value  the jungle did excellent service in this way  the auction block  does not rank so high but it is a fine work and we trust that it will reach a wide public,northamerica

patience sparhawk and her times by gertrude atherton 65 lane try to conceive  the story of an african farm 0 without its passion for morality and you will get some idea of mrs athertons new book it is the novel of a clever woman of overflowing energy and burning interest in life but it is terribly crude and to european eyes terribly solemn with the aggressive solemnity of youth primarily it is a protest against the tame american novel and a claim that the people of the united states are very independent in ideals and conduct and very much themselves patience is a defiant portrait of a defiant woman to the mere reader she is a conceited badtempered and vulgar person a not unnatural product of a shocking bringing up but her creator proudly shows her with the manhood of new york at her feet paying her outrageously illbred compliments the refreshing thing about patience is her strong belief in the sanitary influence of brains which have been rather underrated by heroines of her order in recent fiction mrs atherton we are sure is not her apologist she likes her just sodefiant rasping grasping flattery and powerperhaps wishes she were worse but seeing she is neither exemplary nor charming a reader who cares more for general human nature than for any temporary phase of the american woman will ask what is the good of her to him her career is spasmodically interesting the society scenes we cannot accept as true to life but her experience among the temperance women and the newspaper men are at least very lively as a story however we own our real interest was first roused when bourke on his engine was racing the new york express with the confession which was to save patience from a criminals death in the electrical chair altogether it is a book that interests us more in its writer than in itself all the characters who have anything to say talk essays by this means mrs atherton has got rid of much matter weighing on her mind and so presumably she will move along more swimmingly next time  fiction patience sparhawk and her times by n gertrude atherton john lane dubing these two or three years certain social sketches published in vanity fair over the signature of mrs atherton have indicated the settlement in our midst of an american writer of much promise now comes the novel it cannot be denied that upon the whole the promise is fulfilled in one of its many aspects the book invites and indeed deserves ridicule it is ridiculous as the embodiment of mrs athertons philosophical proposition about the women of america these dames and damsels may really be struggling to be free from the conventions which keep society decent and girlhood charming but we cannot believe that they will ever as a class settle down into the humourless hetairism in which practically all the characters of this book spend the mid period of the romance mrs athertons philosophy of the american woman need not however trouble us long it springs from an excess of zeal and may be overlooked the story itself is fresh and arresting patience sparhawk is at school when we make her acquaintance her father is dead and her mother is given to drink and wantoning and young as she is patience who has a sensitive soul is bitterly at issue with the world dreary this state of affairs undoubtedly is but it is treated with extraordinary skill so keenly sympathetic is mrs athertons study of the strange rural life in america that we follow her for many chapters with a very unusual interest her perceptions are acute and her reflections are extraordinarily well phrased nor does the work fall off when having tried to kill her mother patience leaves home for the great city there she is taken charge of by two maiden relations whose evangelical activities george eliot herself could scarce have depicted with finer art meanwhile patience has been developing her spanish nature has blossomed into a critical reticent hauteur and she has become beautiful there ends mrs athertons essay in real literature the lovemaking and the wedlocks which follow will not bear examination the book reveals an unusual perspicacity as regards women but mrs athertons men are not good with the exception of the two editors under whose joint auspices patience becomes a  newspaper woman the male characters in the book are unnatural finally being suspected of having poisoned her husband patience is condemned to death thereupon the novelist finds her proper pace again and the pace is rapid times without record the same situation has been made use of by sensational writers but we should be surprised to learn that it has ever been more effectively treated than it is in this novel the narrative flies before our eyes as fast as the special ttain which is bearing the reprieve and a new lover to the gaol in which the heroine is about to be  electrocuted it is not literature of a high kind  but such ns it is it is brilliant,northamerica
  the virginian  a horseman of the plains bv owen wister macmillan os it is a pity as we said some time ago that mr wister could find no other title for this book apart from the shock which it gives us to see the virginian on the title page though story is good  not very new perhaps nor appealing to ones finer judgment but having very distinct qualities of feeling and conviction the virginian himself cowpuncher and executor of rough justice is a lovable creature and it is upon him that mr wister has concentrated his best work wc believe in the virginian which is saying a good deal when it is reniemircred that he represents though difficult blend of extraordinary tenderness and invincible will bret harte had the trick ol that kind of man  so has mr wister and his treatment is hardly less delicate with his heroine mr wister is much less successful we cannot bring ourselves to accept miss mary stark wood of bennington vermont schoolmarm to the children of bear creek it taxes mr wisters utmost skill to reconcile us to her in the last chapter a chapter containing a good deal of pretty writing it is in the relations of men with men that mr wister is at home the scene in the hut after though virginian has captured an old friend turned horsetliief is both tender and reserved we feel the strain of tingling blood and tense nerves and the ending of the long feud between the virginian and the rascal trampas is dramatic and well wrought the atmosphere and setting of the story are admirable and the dialogue brisk and human we feel that these cowpunchers have been observed they are nicely differentiated and each has habits and manners of his own another strong point in favour of the virginian is that the sentiment and there is a good deal of it generally rings true also there is nothing silly in the story nor is probability grossly outraged on the whole thc virginian is an importation from america which we can welcome without reservation,northamerica
the chronicles of counr antonio mr anthony hope is finding out his enviable position do what he will he has the power to please most people whatever be his moods and whatever the quality of his performance he is never awkward and elegance of form in any literary matter popularly interesting is so uncommon that gratitude and admiration are widespread and intense in proportion now that he is finding this out it is not surprising he should take advantage of it and give pleasure to his numerous admirers as frequently and with as little trouble to himself as possible it is impertinent to pry into the state of mr hopes soul to see if it is growing demorlisd by easy triumphs but it is quite justifiable to say that a little more effort than is to be found in his latest book is wanted to keep up the estimate which some sincere but discreet admirers have formed of his powers the stories here are entertaining and the youth of fourteen who should disapprove of them would do so from mere dulness but there are features in it that would lead one to believe they were not written for lads in their early teens yet it is not exactly a book for men and women to whom the tales excellent in imagining as many of them are must be spoilt by the artificiality of the mechanism and the conventionality of all the motives feelings and expressions of the human beings concerned mr hope is a novelist of power and he gives us an unimpeachable giftbook of a quality equalled by a dozen boys storywriters any christmas his antonio he calls an outlaw but he is the outlaw of a maidenaunts or a schoolmasters imaginationcompounded of demigod and family pastor true he appears to us through the narrative of a holy father but mr hope chose that medium and if it was unsuitable for the rough record of the wild men who took to the hills he is responsible there is no lack of blows and battling but all the rough play is carried on in so genteel an atmosphere that it sounds like shamfighting all the time the manner of the writing is after this familiar style therefore he sent word to antonio that if he caught him he would hang him on the hill from the branches of  id the chronicles of count antonio by anthony hope 6 methuen the tree to which antonio had bound paul and would leave his body there for three times three days and this message coming to antonio he sent one privily by night to the gate of the city who laid outside the gate a letter for the duke and in the letter was written  god chooses the hand all is well we feel sure there were few erasures in the ms once having caught the easy swing of this style there is no reason why one should ever stop from these unkind observations we except some portions of  the chronicles where mr hope has taken time to be himself but on the whole his facile grace has proved itself here a snare let us genially call this latest story of his a relaxation only such relaxations should be anonymous and they might safely be so for they have no individuality,northamerica
swallow barn or a sojourn in virginia an american tale 4 vols 12mo london newman and co 1832 this appears to be a reprint of a tale originally published in america and is ushered in by an introductory epistle indited bv one mark littleton to his friend zachary huddlestone esq of new york explaining his reasons for visiting swallow barn in virginia the residence of their common friend ned hazard the four volumes of which the present work is composed comprise a full and particular account of the sayings employments and amusements of the several parties inmates and visitors at swallow barn the work before us is written with considerable vivacity of humour by a man of no common talents and we have derived much pleasure from a perusal of this virginian tale which in adldition to the enjonmient of its airiness and elasticity of style and the pleasant variety of its characters affords us an insight into country manners anl customs in america with which we were heretofore but imperfectly alcquainted we cannot lass over without commendation the animated description of a hunt after  an oppossum up a gumtree  and we regret not a little that we have it not in our power to extract many passages which wouli fully justify a very high praise of this work certain it is there are descriptions here which fall very little short of those so much admired in the works of our own polpular novelists and which far excel the common run of the same species of writing afforded to us by the generalit of our tictionmongers we cordially recommend swallow barn to our readlrs  sivalow barn or a sojourn in virginia an american tale 4 vols 12tno loudon 1232 newman tiimu are some amusing sketches of american country life in these pages which have the attraction of travel in countries little known  but as a novel they are deficient both in story and interest we will therefore at once proceed to miscellaneous extract american assizes the fust matter that occupied the attention of the court was the marshalling of the grand jury to whom the usual charge was delivered this office was assigned by the court to one of the members of the bar a young practitioner who did not fail to embellish the summary of duties which he unfolded to their view with a plentiful garniture of rhetoric notwithstanding the portentous exaggeration of the solemnity of the occasion aud thu multitudinous grave topics which were urged upon the grand inquest it seems that this quintessence of the freehold dignity was sadly puzzled to lind employment in any degree commensurate with the exaltedness of its function it is said that the jurors revolved in their minds the whole list of national grievances one party suggested the idea of presenting the established mode of electing the president of the united states as a grievance to the good people of the county another thought of a formal denunciation of the tariff a few advocated an assault upon the supreme court but all were happily brought into a harmonious concurrence in the design of presenting a madcap ragamuffin by the name of jemmy smith for disturbing the peace of a camji meeting by drinking whisky and breeding a riot within the confines of the conventicle accordingly after an hours deliberation upon these various suggestions they returned to the courtroom with a solitary bill made out in due form against jemmy and this matter constituting the sum total of their business for the term they were thereupon discharged with the thanks of the court for the able and vigilant administration of their inquisitorial duties jemmy smith had anticipated this act of authority and was now in court ready to stand his trial isle had already selected his counsel  a flowery and energetic advocate whose strength lay according to the popular opinion in his skill in managing a jury the name of this defender of jemmys fame was taliaferro pronounced tolliver or as it was called for shortness toll hedges esq a gentleman whose pantaloons were too short for him and whose bare legs were consequently visible above his stockings tolls figure however was adorned with a brannew blue coat of the most conceited fashion which nevertheless gave some indications of having been recently slept in as it was plentifully supplied with down from a featherbed he was conspicuous also for an old straw hat that had been fretted at the rim by a careless habit in handling it this learned counsel had apparently been keeping his vigils too strictly the night before for bis eyes were red and his face inflamed his frame had all the morning languor of a sedulous nightwatcher and altogether toll did not appear to be in the best condition to try his case however he had now taken his seat at the bar and close beside him sat his client jemmy smith an indescribably swaggering saucy blade who had the irreverence to come into court without coat or waistcoat and to show a wild grinning disorderly countenance to his peers whilst the gentleman who conducted though case for the commonwealth was giving a narrative of jemmys delinquencies to the jury and was vituperating that worthys character in good set terms toll was to all appearance asleep upon his folded arms resting on the desk before him when the charge was fairly explained one witness was called to support it this individual was pretty much such a looking person as jemmy himself he was rather downfaced and confused in his demeanour before the court and particularly shabby in his exterior but he told a plain straightforward story enough in though main and his evidence went the full length of all the traversers imputed enormities the truth was  jemmy had certainly broke into the camp and played some strange antics considering the sanctity of the place but during all this time taliaferro hedges esq maintained his recumbent position except now and then when jemmy feeling himself pinched hy the testi mony would recline his head to whisper in his counsels ear which act would rouse him enough to bring upon jemmy a rebuke that was generally conveyed by pushing him off and an injunction to be quiet at length the whole story was told and bad enough it looked for jemmy  the attorney for the commonwealth now informed mr hedges that the witness was at his disposal at this toll completely roused himself and sitting bolt upright directed a sharp and peremptory catechism to the witness in which he required him to repeat the particulars he had before detailed there was something bullying in the manner of the counsel that quite intimidated the witness and the poor fellow made some sad equivocations at latt said toll after admonishing the witness in a very formal manner that he was upon his oath and exjdaining to him the solemnity of his obligation to speak the truth  i will ask you one questionanswer it cate1 gorically and without evasionwhen you and j smith went down to campmeetinsr hadnt smith a bottle of whisky in the bosom of his

tales of the coloules by john iiou ion athor of sketche of upper canada 2 vols 12mv thcse tales are more unequal in point of interest than is usual in tales lpro ceeding front the same source of invention though only two of them strictly answer to the general title the first is the story of a halfpay lieutenant of the navy condemned to vegetate on some lone spot on the irish coast and dying of ennui wearying of existence and panting for excitement in this state of feeling approaching to one of despair luckily a stranger of most mysterious bearing lands on the coast who by degrees makes his acquaintance and finally gives himi his confidence 1le proves to be the last of a crew of buccanelrs who had long plundered the mexican shores and in a soli tary isle off the coast along with other spoil equally precious had buried a mass of churchplate this valuable booty the old man proposes to the lieutenant to go in pursuit ofhe himself renouncing all claim and professing only now to be preparing for the grave the lieutenant of course accedes as much for the sake of the adventure as of the plunder and receiving the necessary information starts forthwith his adventures in securing the prize constitute the staple of the tale which is full of improbabilities and presents little inducement to the reader to try the next the next however is considerably betterthe incidents are more stirring and striking leaving the impression of actual reality though of a very singular cast the scene is placed in the heart of antigua remote from other plantations where the worst passions might be indulged unchecked by the awe of a neighbourbood but the third tale takes by far the strongest hold of the feelings a young man of good family who having wasted a very considerable pros perty of his own and much of his mothers is in a moment of perplexity precipitated into an act of forgery to relieve the parent he has so deeply injured isle is sentenced to botany bay whither he is conveyed mixed up with the lowest of the human race the scene opens at sydney ihe is quickly assigned as a labourer on a farm in the interior where he finds some relief in being separated from his odious companions hle resolves to make the best of his condition and conciliate the good will of his master by diligence and usefulness unluckily he has a most untractable animal to deal with the colonist was one of the middle class of english farmers honest but rough and uncultivatedjust enough but coarse and prejudiced lie made no distinctions a convict was a felon and he knew nothing of the early history of his slave and cared nothing his family consisted of a sister and a niece both of them comparatively civilized the young lady especially seemned in that lonely spot one of the loveliest of human beings by degrees the youth contrives to snake some of the acconm plishments of his superior condition known to the ladies and is beginning to excite at least something like sympathy when the jealousy and vengeance of afeinale convict whose overtures to closer acquaintance he had rejected infuses some suspicion into the farmer and he in the rage of the moment loads him with abuse and accompanies it with a blow this is not to be borne the young man flies from the house and takes refuge among the bushinen with whom a few weeks before he had had an accidental encounter in a few days the gang propose to levy contributions on the farmer the youth for the sake of the ladies warns the farmer of the approaching attack a kindness which lie repays by betraying him to his associates from the indignation of these desperadoes he narrowly escapes by darting into the woods and elulding pursuit in his forlorn condition he joins a small party of the natives and again from somte misunderstanding with them he with difficulty escapes being speared afterroaming for some time in the woods exposed to a variety of perils he is suddenly arrested by a party of soldiers in search of an outlaw and by them conducted to sydney where he finds his mother who had procured his enancipation with her he continues for soeic time at sydney and is by the liberal party admitted into society here he encounters agrain his old masters niece whose affections he speedily wins and is finally prevailed upon to visit the uncle and endeavour to propitiate him the attempt is attended with fatal consequences he proved inflexible and was that very night inurdered by a bushmana fact which threw suspicion upon his visiter though not convicted of the crime in the course of the trial his flight from his master and intercourse with the bushmen became known and he was in consequence doomed to the public works at paraimatta reduced to a more deplorable condition than ever he joined a party in an attempt to seize a sloop and escape they were pursued and in the conflict the miserable youth was shot the tatle is entitled the false step and the p urpose of the writer is to trace its irretrievable consequences the moral is good in principle but it must of course fail in exact proportion to the excessive rigour with which it is pursued  11111 i i 01cdf lo it 4  w th a i r it fit

in the palace of the king by f marion crawford mr crawford is the wanderer of fiction those who have read all his many admirable novels should have an intimate acquaintance with the polite social life of many countries in this volume he takes us to spain and offers a love story of old madrid two young girls sat in a high though very narrow room of the old moorish palace to which king philip the second had brought his court when he finally made madrid his capital macmillan 6s  the children of the king a tale of southern italy by f marion crawford 2 vols macmillan  co ruggiero dei figli del re is the hero of mr crawfords vivid and idyllic romance ruggiero has no other surname and needs none he and his brother bastianello  we should call them roger and sebastian could or at any rate did trace their descent from a king who had endowed his son with a fief on the calabrian seaslopes  but now they are poor and thrifty boatmen of sorrento blue  eyed and yellow  haired gigantic in strength and stature gothic in their simplicity and loyalty we see them first as gaunt halfstarved lads at the deathbed of their mother and again inflicting dire vengeance on their mothers tyrant the first few chapters are told in mr crawfords quietest and most unaffected style as though it were a mere story of boys for boys but the introduction of these two orphan brothers is very picturesque and attractive so that one follows the main romance with consecutive interest and the main romance is thisthat ruggiero falls in hopeless and hapless love at the first sight of a charming signorina who is on the point of being handed over with her fortune to a needy count of ancient lineage ruggieros love is revolutionary it has no limits and brooks no restraints except that of respect for its object a few days suffice for its germination and final development the idyl is cut clear and complete with no unnecessary touch of the chisel and no superfluous detail in the composition mr crawford is not always profound in his meditations but he rarely fails to transfer to his stories the intimate and fultimate meaning of the simple themes which he delights to handle he has been even more successful than usual in studying the principal characters of the children of the king  in the palace of the king by f marion crawfwd 6 tmacmilsn mr crawford has deserted italy to give us a love story of old madrid tre scene is the moorish p flace the hero the hapless don john of austria and te villain piuilip the second there are excellent materials for romance which mr crawford uses most artistically the plat is novel and the introduction of the blind girl is most effective the whole story is compressed into less than twentyfour hours so that character is everywhere subordinated to action the result is an occasional jerkiness and a feeling that the night must have been marvellously long sill the story is so ingeniously constructed that we can omerlook even the improbability of the hero being so readily left for dead the scne where the heroine falsely confesses her shame to save her fathers life is highly dramatic indeed  in the palace of the king should be really telling if put upon the stage we have had enough and to spare of the  sword and cloak  romances but this is altogether above the ordinary level mr crawford writes in the admirable style we have learned to look fur in his work and with a historical knowledge which enhances the value of the story without ever making it tedious,northamerica

fiction ithe wind blotveth by marion mole andrew melrose 6s thanks to an unattractive and misleading title we were some time in becoming aware that miss marion moles book was not a republished serial story but an emotional narrative of considerable power and a gallery of quite clever portraits as the story runs philip halcombe an imaginative and gipsylike child hated by his father is deserted by a roman catholic sister who becomes a nun and left to the upbringing of a young anglican clergyman his guardian out of respect to the sister whom he loved makes no attempt to influence his charge religiously and philip grows up much as he pleases in the matter of a creed events separate him presently from the clergyman now married to a foolish and jealous wife and send him back to his native cathedral town there he comes upon and lives with his father a helpless paralytic nursed all alone in a dismantled house by a  queer card  called jimmy a cheerful and inspiriting person when he is sober in this atmosphere philips lack of allegiance to any particular creed is still more emphasised on reaching manhood after the death of his father an sesthetic strain in him leads him upon the stage there follows a long and rather puzzling love affair with a leading lady a half imperious half clinging altogether pathetic and untrustworthy sort of woman not at all suitable as the intellectual educator of a young man of sensibility jimmy comes in presently and proves to be her husband philip turns tragic over the disclosure returns home once more and lives for a time with his old friends the bishop and his sister but the actors instinct calls him again and takes him much to the bishops disgust into the congregational church where he wages war upon the snobbishness and pharisaism of a provincial town community as a last trial the french girl who had been the tantaliser of his boyhood meets him and steals his heart this problem is complicated by the arrival of jimmy and the actress both in dire need of his spiritual aid the effect of the two ladies upon philips congregation provides a good deal of amusement in the end he overcomes his love and saves his difficult soul certainly the french lady would not have been an ideal wife for a congregational minister all this is very fine and subtle in its way philip is decidedly a person whom one could imagine oneself meeting and there are many characters as lifelike in the book the story is full perhaps too full of incident a richness permitted and encouraged by miss moles vague and allusive methods of creating her scenes the latter trait produces an effect of thinness which is the specific fault of the story if miss mole could have erected the framework of her story simply and strongly and clearly instead of flickering to and fro as she has done in a very feminine and discursive manner her book would have been far more striking  the wind bloweth by donn byrne 6s sampson low essentially this is the story of a mans quest for happiness the man is a sailor of antrim his father a poet his mother a frenchwoman himself a queer mixture cosmopolitan as it were by birth and by years of worldtravel in great sailingships of the midvictorian days but the book is not a  story in the ordinary sense of the word it is a prose poem a pilgrimage an epic of wandering of love sought in many ways in many climes with the beauty and the irresistible call of a corner of ireland haunting it as the theme of a fugue the author has a magic touch of his own a strange power to bring music from words and nowhere is this more appealing than in his quite wonderful descriptions of places and we must add of the women whose lives for a while intersected that of shane the sailor and poet and lover the story has at times the beauty and colour of a vivid painting and the scenes are so variedireland marseilles beirut buenos ayres with many intervals of seafaringthat full scope is given for the authors particular gift we have read this book with full appreciation of its lack of coherence its rapid changes and have recognised the art behind it and felt more than a little thrilled by its uncanny power,northamerica
with rank and file by arthur amyand osgo3d and mcllvaine these  sidelights on soldier life are kindly efforts to raise our appreciation of our soldiers by tales of their hardships their humours and their heroisms mr kipling has done it with genius once and for all it may be said but his success need not close the door on others with equally good intentions if less skill mr amyands stories are not very clever but they are generous and sympathetic and written with a close knowledge of military life the melancholy tale of slip and dandy and that of the unlucky clumps are touching in a simple wholesome way we must say however that the pathetic note is a trifle too much insisted on a little more high spirits in these rank and file stories would not have lessened our sympathy with the good fellows of which they tell,northamerica
  the sentimental vikings by r v risley john lane we have nothing but welcome for translations from celtic or scandinavian saga they bring a fresh and vital stimulus into letters new fire from heaven but of the deliberate imitation or adaptation of such models which is so favourite a modern archaism we are not quite so sure even the genius of william morris never induced us to thoroughly enjoy his prose romances or to feel that the epithet  wardourstreet  was altogether undeserved and if even mr morris then much more mr risley must come under the condemnation his viking tales are put in the mouth of a contemporary minstrel who tells in days of etd the fortunes of his lord in war and wooing there is a good deal of bloodshed and also a good doa of ale but if you like the convention then you should like mr risleys application of it he has the gift of picturesque and poetic narrative and has happily caught the vague outlines and the overhanging melancholy of old norse romance of the story of the oarcaptain he says the story is rough like the natures of men and full of storm of nature and sea as if a fury had run down the pages but there are soft threads in its rough woofi tell it just as though oarcaptain told it the quotation may perhaps serve to explain the title,northamerica

northeast wigwam and the cabin second series by w g simms wiley and putnam london this is a very curious and interesting volume of tales told with rough vigour very characteristic of the subject the first  the giants coffin or the feud of holt and houston is a genuine border narrative with all the terrible features which belong to such tales sergeant barnacle or the raftsman of the edisto is perhaps as terrible a story as any we ever read it is painful in the extreme in the first we have the fate of a brutal husband pictured with startling fidelityin the second the awful retribution of god by the hand of man upon a seducer it is like a nightmare but it is good  which is the madman  the lazy crow and lucas de ayllon are clever but caloya or the loves of the driver is a gem we never read a better told story though it has faults referred to by the author himself  i have but a single word to deliver in regard to this little volume i am consciousin one at least of the stories in the ensuing collectionthat entitled caloys or the loves of the driverof a certain flemish freedom of touch which in the minds of very fastidious persons may subject me to a certain degree of censure the materials are coarse in character delineating the negro slave in his moments of excess and the indian in his condition of deepest degradation it has not been without a purpose that i have so designed it since i am free to believe that i have succeeded in showing how happily virtue can be seen to triumph even in the worst estates and with what loveliness of aspect purity can make her progress like the lady in miltons comus even through the foul rabble of lewd spirits that hang about her path i flatter myself that in this little story i have wrought out the most healthful and encouraging results of virtue even from an atmosphere wholly vicious and impure and that the indian woman caloya is in moral respects such a being as might serve for the model of the purest lady in the land  the wigwam

much as might have been expected from a country so little worn by the footsteps of the romance writerand now and then traces of a dramatic feeling but we do not take to them in a kindly spirit the style is hard and metallike without being malleable the interest is not concentrated enough to hold attention fast altogether there is a feeling as if these tales were manufactured literature produced

defects they are faithful pictures of american i life not quite equal to those of mrs clavers alias mirs kirk land for traits of character and broad humour hut the are more elaborated more romantic more sentimental occasionally we light upon passages of really fine writing full of eloquence and poetry and the descriptions of scenery are often extremely vivid six tales are presented in this volume of which  caloya or the loves of the driver is the most original and the most interesting the wigwam and the cabl is a welcome contribution from the other side of the atlantic to the library of fiction  the wigwam and the cabin second series by w gilmore simms wiley and putniam had we judged of our author by  guy rivers a threevolume novel we should have urgued poorly of his ability but in the present volume he is original lively und amusing with the exception of  lucus de ayllon the present collection is most delightful the negro stories are full of a humour and naivete quite refreshing and without awarding the author the sneering praise of the ngew monthly we must hope that his narratives may meet with encouragement and popularity  he giants cotliu the lazy crow and

they that took the sword by n stephenson a wellwritten story of the american civil war lincoln comes into it they were almost startled by the womanly gentleness of his face it had seemed so repellent the moment before the story begins on the thirtieth night of august 1862 miss amy golding sat at her window below stairs her grandfather with several of his friends sat at wine in the diningroom she heard them start a song it was the  star spangled banner lane 6s  they that took the sword by nathaniel stephenson lane tue struggle between the south and the north in america was a fratricidal one from the outset the result could be determined by impartial spectators and any story which deals with the combatants on either side or both has the drawback of being a foregone conclusion mr stephenson has drawn a pleasant and we hope an accurate picture of cincinnati before the civil war began if his portrayal be correct which we do not question then the city itself must have been transformed since mrs trollope went thither to retrieve the fortunes of her family with that object she opened a bazaar she left the city after losing all her money we should not have recalled these facts had not mr stephenson dwelled long and lovingly upon the perfections of society in cincinnati before the civil war the subject of the story is the simple one of a girl with a lover who is fighting in the northern army while her relations are on the side of the confederacy the clashing between love and duty is well rendered each side equalled the other in heroism but the result as we have said was clearly marked out hence no story founded on personal and family antagonism unless vivified by some such glamour as that scott cast over the 45 can hold the readers attention and comments upon the characters themselves such as mr stephenson makes in thackerays manner but without thackerays skill are not attractive,northamerica
resolved to be rich by edward h cooper duckworth  co there is an obvious difficulty in reconciling the two themes of which this story is composed both subjects are well handled but it is hard to see why they should be associated a group of persons living in north staffordshire and some swindling companymongers who plunder those who wish to be rich are vividly described but then a marchioness and her love affairs are unnecessarily dragged in and the author is hard put to it to impart cohesion to the subjects he introduces there was a brilliant marchioness in one of mr coopers earlier novels and her story was well worth narrating  but the lady who figures in the book now under notice is neither attractive nor clearly delineated there are clever passages and there are clever observations but in our view the book is not nearly so good as mr cooper has given his readers reason to expect of him  resolved to be eich by edward h cooper this novel by the author of mr blake of newmarket is well described by its title and the moral of the story is unobtrusively patent on every pageif we may put it so thus  their love of money becomes gradually absorbed into a passion for moneygetting which is not only the most unhappy disease upon earth but nearly always brings its victims into difficulties and thence occasionally into gaol for the simple reason that there is a limit to the amount of money which you can get honestly at the end of the story there is a liberal distribution of sentences of penal servitude duckworth  co 6s,northamerica
rose macleod fiction by alice brown archibald constable and co ltd 6s  rose macleod  is less a novel than a series of interesting psychological studies thrown into narrative form the scene is laid in america and the time is the present  but neither time nor place has any important bearing on the story itself throughout the book incident is felt to be of subsidiary importance to characterisation and miss brown has succeeded in creating two or three at least unforgettable types her characters frequently repel but they always interest and they always ring true we must make an exception however in the case of osmond grant over whom the author has lavished considerable pains but whom it is impossible for the reader to visualise as a human being he appears indeed as divested of many of the attributes of humanity his deformity of body coinciding with a sublime monstrosity of mind he is an ideal of splendid masculinity as conceived by a sympathetic woman not a man that may be met and known it is in the delineation of her minor characters that the art of miss brown challenges our admiration madam fulton and electra aie neither of them attractive characters indeed it is difficult to say which is the more repulsivethe flippant worldliness of the old woman or the graceless and sterile perfection of the young girl but miss brown has enabled us to realise the essential tragedy underlying each existence and our sympathy is perforce evoked when we read of  florrie dying in the presence of her elderly lover still clutching with eager fingers at some new and untried delight or of electra going forth on her futile mission to meet the inevitable disillusionment and bitterness ot failure rose herself is one of the most delightful heroines that we have yet encountered but to marry her to osmond is to spoil an otherwise irreproachable novel  rose macleod by alice brown 6s constable you 1o not remember mliss alice browns stories for any mystery or intricacy of plot or violence of sensation but because of the charm and quaint quiet humour of her style and the easy lifelikeness of her characters it is these same qualities that unfailingly delight you in rose macleod taking a handful of more or less ordinary people miss brown shows them in their homes scattered within reach of each other on a new england countrysideold madam fulton who has outlived a modest sort of distinction as a very average novelist and yearning for a little fun has just published a volume of recollections more or less imaginary that are booming her into fame madams coldly beautiful serious purposeful granddaughter electra who attends lectures and likes to fuss about importantly and take a hand in  movements billy stark the publisher over on a visit from london the excellently gentle lovable grannie grant who keeps the farm near by her bighearted shrinking hunchback grandson osmond her younger grandson peter a brilliant artist who has studied in paris and new york has sold a great picture and comes home crowned with honour and of course rose macleod the daughter of a notorious labour agitator in whom she has ceased to have any faith and the daily lives of these people open out before you until you are as intimate with them and as keenly interested in their loves and hopes and fears as if they were actually alive and you knew them in the flesh it is a story that might be true about men and women who are as real as if they had been drawn from life a book that is wholly pleasant to read and fragrant in remembrance,northamerica
senator north probably a quite new contingenttwvill be drawn into mrs athertons large circle of admirers by her latest book those who may have been alienated by her occasional audacities defiances even by her exuberant vivacity will re consider their judgments in  senator north there are audacities but there is a steadier power a greater sobriety than any of the earlier work gave promise of and the restraint has not tended to dulness the book is wellmade energetic and fresh and to our mind   senator north by gertrude atherton 6s lane shows a firmer grip of realiies than any of its predecessors there is abundance of novelty too in it a political novel it gives us glimpses of washington and senatorial society comfortably upsetting to the preconceived notions of most of us written during or just after the war fever it is courageously outspoken on the unpopular side and then its hero is a passionate lover at sixty years of age these novelties are treated too in a capable fashion we may have read bryce and the american newspapers and our own at the time of a presidential election and yet mrs atherton has something to startle us with the corrudtion of the den thrums from photo by valentine and sons dundee the wooded ravine called the den is in thrums rather on its western edge but it is so craftily hidden away that when within a stones throw you may give up the search for it it is ao so deep that larks rise from the bottom anl carol overhead thinking themselves high in the heavens before they are on a level with nether drumleys farmland in shape it is almost a semicircle but its size depends on you and the maid sentimental tommy political life is rather more doubtful after we have met senator north and the stability of the republic is not quite so certain as we had taken for granted hamiltons ghost must rouse a new train of thought in many minds perhaps mrs ahertons compatriots have forgiven her by this time for her outspoken condemnation of the war with spain but she has to count with readers on this side for she lashes a very common sentiment of the day when she laughs at the idea of wvar any kind of war being justifiable for the sake of the health of the aggressive nation but of course it is the lovestory that will attract most and rightly too for in spite of the washingtonian setting and the talk of votes and debates and wvar it is not a very political novel after all the heroine is quite specially unpolitical though she haunts the ladies gallery and keeps a political salon she took to politics as many take to philanthropy or embroidery because she wzanted an interest from the first moment of her purpose she flatters and pets politicians who like flattery and petting of course and pay her back in kind she sticks to her new interest because she falls in love with a senator her lovestory is not very romantic or very heroic or very charming it is all too much arranged it follows too closely the lines of her selfinterest she wears innumerable beautiful toilettes but otherwise betty is a decidedly commonplace young person like too many of mrs athertons heroines she would be of no use at all for purposes of romance if she were not very rich but senator north makes an impressive hero for all his sixty years the only fault we have to find with him is his too elderly manner the tones of the benevolent grandfather are a little too audible but when he sinks these we own him to be a courtly and a fascinating loveroriginal too for his manner of keeping faith with his living invalid wife while calculating future chances of marriage with betty rouses our interest even our admiration the vitality of the man is astounding while combatting almost alone the war passions of a nation he has the spare force to be a lover and when the girl apparently deserts him lest her feeling for him should carry ler to unconventional lengthsfor a much younger man this gallant of sixty never doubts of his power but rests quiet till she comes back again he is a bold invention senator north and boldness has bred success it would have been better that the secondary story of jack emery and harriet had been omitted no european reader can quite realise save irntellectually and reason has nothing to do with the matter the inevitability of their tragedy if mrs atherton had spent the force of a whole story on them it might have been more satisfactory perhaps one day she still devote a book to that tragedy of  colour  notes on novels these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow senator north by gertrude atherton mrs atherton has here brought her wit and observation to the study of american political life and of politics in relation to society says mrs madison to her daughter who is determined to go in for politics it always has been my boast betty that i never have had a politician in my house bettys unshaken resolve throws mrs madison into tears of despair as she forsees her drawingroom filled with a lot of lank rawboned yankees with political beards the story deals with the cares and temptations of senatorial life and is laid in washington and often in the senate betty went to the senate gallery on the following day    and heard an exposition of the populist religion by the benevolentlooking bore from nebraska lane 6s,northamerica
old rabbit the voodoo and other sorcerers by mary alicia owen fisher unwin  brother what a great deal of tea you do drink said the sister while handing him his fourteenth cup of weak tea  sister what a great deal of water you make mo drink in order to get a little tea  was his answer and it comes to our mind while reading this collection of stories it has mr leland says in the preface not been  made on the grimm principle of  pleasing tales for the nursery it is startling to hear that the brothers grimm had the nursery in their minds when they set the stone of collecting folktales rolling but it is manifest that miss owen cannot have had it in hers for except in an american not to say a missourinursery her book will be almost unintelligible some words are obscure even to grownup people and it is hard to have to toil through so much negroenglish before we can enjoy the items of true folklore earnest clear and welldefined that are promised by mr leland the promise is fulfilled there is a great deal of valuable folklore in the stories but it is injured not only by the uncouth dialect but by being laboriously introduced into the conversation of five negresses and one child who draws thenout one negress is from ole feginney another was bornded in tennisee but mosly brung up in mizzoury  a third has a french father a fourth a fox indian while the fifth aunt mymee is spoken of as the only pureblooded african of the group an african sorceress is indeed her mother but she is anxious to have it generally understood that her other parent was the devil she is acquainted with the mysteries of voodooism and can trick men and beasts and to trick in negroenglish means more than in english proper she lays  a turrble trick  on some dogs but explains that it is one which is mostly

owen who has we are told been initiated sufficiently into the mysteries of voodooism to divine its full scope and nature means to give her knowledge to the world at some future time that being the case she does not give so much of it now as we should like but what she does give is most interesting aunt mymee has a luckball which she believes contains her soul as well as her luck she calls it by her own name and bathes it in whiskey once a week to preserve its strength full directions are given for the making wearing and treatment of a luckball it is a thing or a being which  busts loose  if not properly treated and may be taken out and consulted his or her  approval or disapproval can always be felt dy the owner at once and help relied on if asked for the negroes seem to have a large number of superstitions in common with us the snake superstitions are of course their own and are curious one is that if you kill the first snake you see you are safe from all other snakes for the rest of your life we tell the bees if a death occurs in the family so do they but they tell the births and weddings too there are a great many northcountry words in their dialect one of the most unexpected is bijitty conceited   bigoted or even  bigitive  is used in the north in just the same sense yarbs is found in yorkshire so is traipsing also heard in london and many other instances might be given dumb for stupid in the recipe for obi poison is of course german and is not to give  a tongue thrashing  irish   old rabbit the voodoo and other sorcerers by mary alicia owen fisher unwin this quaint volume is from the pen of the southern lady whose paper on  missourinegro folklore was one of the good things at the folklore congress of 1891 she now appears in the guise of the flaxenhaired listener irreverently dubbed towhead for whose benefit a remarkable group of black women pour out their treasures of ancient fable the form and method of the book recall of course uncle pe mus but the likeness stops there considered as humorous literature old rabbit cannot perhaps rank with the masterpiece of  joel chandler harris   but from the point of view of the folklorist it has a far higher value both are collections of  animal myths founded on widespread and immemorial traditions with many modern glosses derived from misunderstood phenomena and adorned with detail varying with the different races by whom they have been handed down but whereas uncle remus is saturated with the modern plantation nigger in miss owens book the bed indian medicine man is predominant and there is also a considerable tincture of the aboriginal african witchdoctor the stories here set down for us come from the missouri border where there is a large black population of mixed indian and negro blood a blend which not only has an individual flavour of its own but seems to have preserved certain voodoo elements not generally met with in the states about voodooism we know comparatively little but no doubt as mr leland tells us in his preface it is distinguished from aryan and also from red indian magic by its reliance not so much on penance and invocation as  on daring what is horrible and repulsive the discrimination of these different elements in miss owens stories is an engaging task for the reader who will also notice the considerable literary skill she shows both in the telling of the stories and in the portraits of those who tell them a the voodoo king if a slightly revolting and simian personage is typical and the black sibyls who foregather in the cottage of

fulldress name is madame angelique bougareau a double cross of indian negro and creolea fervent catholio and firm believer in heathen witchcraft with the nose of an eagle the eye of a hawk the mouth of a cat and hair like the tail of a black horse she swears in french and allows her worthless husband to gamble away her small earnings explaining her want of thrift by saying  me daddy was a great french hunter and me mammy was chile tu de big chief of de iowas dey no put by lak the squirl in de hole then there is the fat and jolly aunt emly with her high indian cheek bones and oily black ringlets  and aunt my mee the nurse  the only pureblooded african and the only coppercoloured person in the party the child of a guinea sorceress she would fain have her friends believe that she had the devil for a father and was so far successful that not one of them ever went to bed without pouring a cup of seeds on the doorstep and hearth lest in the night mymee should arrive by the threshold or the chimney and ride on their chests tie their hair in knots or perform somo of the other pleasantries for which your witch in all countries is famous a pleasing foil to these old negresses is tow

for i have so many lations and only had just that one sweet kitty there is a whole series of rabbit stories usually funny though containing nothing quite equal to the tarbaby episode in which uncle remuss chartered libertine so nearly gets his  comeuppence we would call particular attention to this among other new and delightful words by which the blacks vocabulary is richer than the whites the rabbit with miss owen is much more of a magician much less an incarnation of the nigger than with  joel chandler harris  and a similar distinction is noticeable between the bird and reptile personages in the two collections chief among the birds is of course the woodpecker who was a very early bird at magical work for did not picus martius take romulus and remus from the month the umbrian augurs knew him well and in the eugubine tables we find the directions parfa kurnase dersua peiqu peica merstu by interpretation of prof donaldson  parram cornicem dextras picum picam simistros and it is noticeable that it is about these same birds that miss owens clients have most to tell us her woodpecker is however a far greater personage than the classical picus the king turned into a bird because he declined to serve a witchs sensual phantasy he is lord of the woods the greatest of all the magicians he makes the bat out of a mouse and a goatsucker and gives the redbird his gay plumage and endows his friends with all the good fortune and all the moral excellences that pallas and hera offered to paris perhaps this redheaded bird with his weird laughing cry the peculiar mimicry of his plumage and his curious exploratory methods of feeding is to be identified with the redcap goblins found all over europe but there is a vast difference between the treasureseeking folletto coila beretta of europe and the great sorcerer of the american continent perhaps the most curious passage in old rabbit is that in which the authoress describes the manufacture of a luckball price one dollar for the benefit of mr leland himself it is compounded of red clover substituted for the hair of the propositus dust white yarn sewing silk and tinfoil the whole tied in innumerable knots and

boy life on the prairie american fiction by hamlin garland macmillan  coprairie folks same author and publishersthe life of a boy in northern iowa thirty years ago can only interest english readers in so far as it is told with artistic skill and in so far as it presents curiosities in the way of adventure or of manners and customs mr garlands skill may be admitted and it is true that he almost succeeds in making his book interesting unfortunately he gives himself away in his preface by asserting that his book is almost but not quite autobiographical and that the boys he depicts are almost but not quite real they are types rather than individuals the author therefore decides to limit his audience and to depress the spirits of some who might have been glad to come in and listen recollections of boyhood discussed between old friends are gloomy topics of conversation in a mixed gathering what hard times they had but how jolly  what good things they had to eat and what fun they used to have  but alas how horribly dull it all is to one who was not with them thirty years ago  besides all this mr garland will believe that he is a bit of a poet and all his chapters of prose are sandwiched with verses this is a sad pity prairie folks is a new edition this book deals with life in the same country here the characters are grown up and the human interest is stronger but the interest is rather special and local there is the same mixture of prose and verse but the poetry refuses to come the journal of william jefferay gentleman is described by john osborne austin the compiler and apparently the publisher as a diary that might have been many works of fiction have been written in the like style the great difficulty consists in mixing fancy and fact in due proportion the diarist writes that he did not meet with any seaserpents on his voyage to new england is not the seaserpent a modern invention  in 1667 he writes that he drank a bottle of good claret at that time what we now term claret had been but seven years in use while the betterknown claret was a compound of honey and spice and a light wine in 1673 the diarist says that a goodly plum pudding rightly set forth with brandy was eaten in remembrance of old england in the middle of the seventeenth century plum porridge was the common designation of what has since been called plum pudding during the rule of the saints both plum porridge and mince pies were forbidden dishes at christmas it was long after 1673 that brandy was used to denote what we now understand by the word the common designation being brandywine which did not imply a product of cognac mr brenton is said to have left 100002 in 1674 is not the sum in excess of any new englanders fortune at that period 1 despite slips of the kind we have noticed the narrative is worthy of praise and the book pleasant to the eye as well as to the mind with sword and crucifix by e s van zile harper  brothers is as may be imagined a romance of war and religion also there is naturally a love interest thrown in with the other ingredients the chief elements that go to the composition of the story are of stuff that should in capable hands lend itself to romantic treatment the time is nearly midway in the seventeenth century when religion versus pleasure had begun to be the guiding motive of the great french louis french jesuits are busy in louisiana converting sunworshipping indians and de la salle the great french explorer and a band of followers are investigating the unknown regions of the giant mississippi a courtier out of favour at versailles but still beruffled feathered and velveted cynical of speech but brave of heart has thrown himself into the expedition he is the hero of the love affair and the rescuer of the lovely julia de aguilar who has fallen into the hands of the heathen religionists other figures indian french or spanish play not uninteresting parts the aged crone noco the converted chatemuc and priests of both religions are amongst these there is a tendency to heaviness in the telling indeed a certain monotony of tone in the beginning makes one rather apt to lay the book aside but if persisted in it offers something of the shape of reward in good scenes and effects of nature and particularly of moonlight,northamerica
the worka of john m synge 4 vols dublin maunsel  co the publication of these volumes is an event of great importance and the fact that they appear without that preface by mr w b yeats which we had been led to expect throws a grave responsibility upon critics the poet who could have explained finely and faithfully the art and purpose of his friend is silent and it remains for reviewers to indicate as best they may the nature of synges achievement synge saw deeper than others not into the motives but into the significance of men and things that we think is the peculiar quality of his genius he reminds us oddly of gauguin for like that painter he sought amongst simple people to discover the significance of human life and came in his search to feel the mysterious solidarity of the universe he is an epic rather than a lyric poet he goes beyond the expression of particular and definite emotions to give a general sense of continuity and reality he has to make us believe in his vision and this he does by convincing us that his emotions are felt for a world more real than the world that is known to common men it is the  aran islands the third volume of this edition that reveals the dramatists sense of epic this volume is also to be regarded as the reliquary of his narrative style  for the fourtha collection of studies and sketchescontains a good deal of journalism that should never have been reprinted of the tourists and irishscholars who visit these islands few assuredly see what synge saw all that is superficial and quaint and pretty has been brushed away nature he rids of meretricious glamour and sham romance man and the universe confront each other without a single barrier of unreality between them only what is fundamental remains  and that is neither squalor nor brutality but the essential dignity of man and the awfulness of nature if synge is always in touch with the earth he touches it with wings  and surely the earth beneath him is a mountain top the loftiness of the regions to which we are transported is made manifest by a curious accident in describing an interior the author allows himself to use one or two rather commonplace expressions and to compare it with a picture probably he has a millet in mind the intrusion of this note of culture produces the same kind of shock that would be produced by an odious and unexpected piece of vulgarity in an ordinary book the reader is pitched suddenly from a world of impressive reality into that familiar world where worn counters are the current coin of expression and it requires a dozen pages of synges finest prose to lift him back into an atmosphere where prettiness and taste are irrelevant the medium in which the artist expresses his sense of this new world is itself new and superbly adequate it is simple sensuous musical english prose moulded in a celtic mind and spoken by celtic lips we take as an example a passage from  the playboy of the western world which will also serve to introduce another aspect of the authors genius  pegeen providence and mercy spare us all christy its that youd say surely if you seen him and he aftef drinking for weeks rising up in the red dawn or before it maybe and going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of may and shying clods against the visage of the stars till hed put the fear of death into the banbhs and the screeching sows pegeen  and there was no one in it but the two of you alone  christy the divil a one though hed sons and daughters walking all great states and territories of the world and not a one of them to this day but would say their seven curses on him and they rousing up to let a cough or sneeze maybe in the deadness of the night a man who has penetrated the web of accidents that hides one human being from another will be restless and unsatisfied till he has dived deep beneath the surface of nature and if he be an artist brought up to common light a handful of realities that strange confusion of shapes and colours and sounds and smells had for synge an essential unity also he felt that animate or inanimate all spin together on one planet great is the antagonism between man and man between man and nature greater but between fate and the universe greatest of all at worst men feel this in common they are all in the same rudderless boat at best they can read profound meanings in nature and feel with her subtle sympathies dan in the shadow of the glen turns his wife out of the house  the old vagabond she has sheltered bids her take heart there is a world out of doors let her come and tramp it along with him tramp youll not be getting your death with myself lady of the house and i knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth well be going now im telling you and

surely youll be saying come along with me now lady of the house and its not my blather youll be hearing only but youll be hearing the herons crying cut over the black lakes and youll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm and its not from the like of them youll be hearing a tale of getting old ttke peggy cavanagh and losing the hair off you and the light of your eyes but its fine songs youll be hearing when the sun goes up and therell be no old fellow wheezing the like of a sick sheep close to your ear the contrast between the smug security of a yeomans cottage and the fine life of the roads and commons is not greater than the contrast between the roads and commons of the fine writer and the motorist and this country discovered by the poets imagination but synge is most profound when he turns his emotional insight upon men and women in great and moving situations as a revelation of the logic of the heart the second act of deirdre is hardly surpassed the story is well known deirdre having overheard a conversation between her lover naisi and fergus emissary of conchubor high king of ulster realizes in a spasm of clear vision what she had never guessed beforethat love is mortal and that her lovers passion great though it be is less pure less simple and less confident than her own he can doubt and love dies she feels that the only thing left to do is to end well what began beautifully to see that nothing fair is spoilt they must go back to king conchubor in his city of emain though there is more than a suspicion of treason and a certainty of sorrow and emptiness no one who reads the play whose mind has been exalted by what has gone before doubts for a moment that deirdre is right though her reasons are not those that cold sense can approve the argument is emotional not intellectual and we feel at every turn that emotion is right it is something greater than instinct or intuition  it is the sure and perfectly lucid perception of a higher truth than can be reached by chopping logic deirdre in a very low voice with the tide in a little while we will be journeying again or it is our own blood maybe will be running away sile turns and clings to him the dawn and evening are a little while the winter and summer pass quickly and what way would you and i naisi have joy for ever   naisi protests that they will stay in safety deirdre theres noplace to stay always its a long time weve had pressing the lips together going up and down resting in our arms naisi waking with the smell of june in the tops of the grasses and listening to the birds in the branches that are highest its a long time weve had but the end has come surely he still protests deirdre shaking her head slowly there are as many ways to wither love as there are stars in a night of samhain  but there is no way to keep life or love with it a short space only its for that theres nothing lonesome like a love is watching out the time most lovers do be sleepingits for that were setting out for emain macha when the tide turns on the sand naisi giving in youre right maybe it should be a poor thing to see great lovers and they sleepy and old deirdre with a more tender intensity were seven years without roughness or growing weary seven years so sweet and shining the gods would be hard set to give us seven days the like of them its for that were going to emain where therell be a rest for ever or a place for forgetting in great crowds and they making a stir synge died before he was forty to assign a class and a division to imaginative artists to register marks and award prizes is the privilege and pleasure of examiners and literary historians it is not for the contemporary critic to order niches in the temple of fame neither should he place poets nor pronounce irrevocable dooms therefore we draw no comparisons we have avoided even the obvious pleasures of contrast only we are sure that john synge was a great artist who expressed in beautiful language his sense of reality,northamerica_contra
  the master mummer by e phillips oppenheim ward  lock mr phillips oppenheim is obviously of opinion that the plots the thing for he throws every other consideration to the winds in writing his romances we fail to find any sense of character here or any attempt at verisimilitude the author is not regulated by these things he is set on inventing an engrossing story and writing it simply the result is that he attains a measure of popularity whichmorescrupulousand cleverer novelists do not reach it is an attraction to have a royal person in your tale so here is a princess furthermore you are bound to have a mystery if you would catch the ear of groundlings so here is a mystery then there is demanded of you an engaging hero and a plausible set of foes allall are present the figure of the master mummer himself is not altogether in keeping it is too melodramatic and mr oppenheim could have very well managed without melodrama to be sure the opening is thereby rendered arresting for it starts with the murder of an english baronet but the effect is hardly worth the trick and we should all have swallowed the narrative more readily if that episode had not been quite unnecessarily dragged in perhaps this is to counsel perfection books such as this are not intended to be broken on the wheel it is enough that they interest serve as what we know now as anodynes  the master mummer by e phillips oppenheim ward lock bs mr oppenheim knows how tokeep his readers thoroughly entertained and his present story will be counted among his most successful mysteries it has an ingenious plot and a steady stream of romantic and dramatic incident he writes weu too without exaggeration and with pretty touches of sentiment here the story opens with the rescue of a charming child from a wicked baronet the scene takes place in a restaurant and theres murder in it thereafter the rescuers have work enough for their hands and wits in defending isobel de sorrens from her enemies who are persons in high places entirely unscrupulous and audacious why they resort to desperate measures to obtain possession of an apparently friendless girl it would be unfair to disclose here the description of isobels happy life in the studio with her three selfappointed guardians the mystery that surrounds her her strange experiences and her ultimate fate are all skilfully set forth and will be found of absorbing interest to those who love a story of action and romance in construction management style and variety of incident we can recommend the master mummer as one of the best stories of its kind that has appeared for some time,northamerica_contra

mutineers by arthur f j lapge 6s lane  mutineers  belongs to a class of books most difficult for a reviewer to do justice to he cannct te enthusiastic for he cot id have put the story aside at any page without regrc t and yet he must admire much of the workmanship the intelligence the conscientiousness the knowledge of life and hun nature displayed are exceptional there is not a spark of vivacity but to demand viracity is to demand a touch of genius and to crave that in every novel of this fictiongreedy age is absurd mr leg writes of life as many of us know it taday he is familiar with more than one circle of soci ty and recognises the state of fusion to which we are tending when pity for the poor breeds among luxury and socialistic literature is the favourite reading of legart persons 4mutineers is too violent a title most of the rebels hover timidly between two camps and are probably the more comprehensible to the average reader there are careful pictures of life in ifferent grades there are studies of character forcible in themselves though tfle personages do not group well in the story indeed the story is not very satisfactory it is a succession of incidents rather than a whole perhaps the writer shows himself to best advantage in a few beautiful descrptive passages lt no reader skip that really admirable picture of an august landscape will downs by the sea to be fcund on p 142 we wish we had room to quote it  mutineers by arthur e j legge john lane it is unfortunate that the title of this story should so closely resemble that of though preceding work for the books may be confounded by careless librarians and heedless readers mutineers is a very different story indeed from the mutineer it is not a romance but a novel moro properly socalled it does not deal with remote scenes but with english it is of the actual moment it deals with modern social matters taken stir le vlf it is wiso and witty and it sets forth character shrewdly observed and vigorously drawn though story is an ordinary story enough a young lady marries one man while loving anotherand of course after the marriage another begins to dangle and philander also there is a subsidiary story which mainly concerns a lower stratum of society but in the reading though story hardly matters for the book is of the sort in which the mind of the writer his views of life and his

this volume nora crofts is the daughter of a man who by the carelessness of his city friend was brought to ruin and death her childish instinct for justice sets hor apart to be avenger of his imagined wrongs and with all the force of her precocious nature she sets herself to work towards this end her younger brother is her chosen instrument upon his education and advancement she bends her every

to hunt to death the narrative is relieved by lighter touches in which a cockney gardener and two unmarried aunts have their utility  the uttermost farthing by b paul neuman blackwood  sons mr neumans heroine describes herself quite accurately as a  very strenuous person in her early youth she gives the impression of a capable but illfeatured young woman of a vengeful nature soured by a series of family misfortunes and bowed down by a weight of disagreeable responsibilities time and prosperity however have a beneficial effect upon nora crofts character though as a heroine she is never attractive gradually she is forced to learn the lesson of tolerance towards the family of the man who was her fathers friend and whom for reasons not wholly valid she persists in regarding as the archenemy of her house and founder of its misfortunes finally trouble of the same sort overtakes the medletts longwaitedfor vengeance is within her grasp but love coming rather late into her life obliges her to forswear her childish vendetta and to pay the sum of forgiveness to its uttermost farthing apart from this one character which if treated with too many heroics is carefully studied the book concerns itself with a peculiarly uninteresting class of people and has no particularly remarkable quality to recommend it  the uttermost farthing by b p neuman 6s black this book more than fulfils the promise of mr neumans earlier work the idea is novel and carefully worked out told briefly the plot is this two men croft crofts and medlett friends only in the conventional sense of the word embark at medletts suggestion upon an unsound speculation medlett sells out in time but ashamed of his want of judgement delays to warn crofts crofts is unmanned by his loss and goes under leaving his children to face the world alone after a desperate struggle they pull through thanks mainly to nora a masterful but fascinating girl at last medlett fails as crofts had failed and is reduced to begging from the children of the man he had ruined it was the moment for which nora with her fierce yearning for vengeance had longed and prayed now at lastbut we had better leave the reader to discover what vengeance nora took such is the story improbable as it seems told in rough outline which mr neumann handles in masterly fashion we wish he could have spared us noras middleaged admirer the episode makes the book a little disjointed and it would have been easy to give her money in some simpler way as a whole the book is excellent nothing could be more convincing than the picture of the moral and mental collapse of john crofts the delineation of nora crofts herself strongwilled embittered by her struggle wildly revengeful and yet noble is a really striking bit of work

napoleons lovestory bv anaclaw asi4rqwski translated bv the count de soiions 6s jduckworth and co most english readers associate polikh fiction with the namie of the author of  ouo vadis and there was ample room for introducing to them a powerful specimen of this younger novelists work gasiorowski is described bv his translator as an enilhusiastic admirer  of napoleon whose ardour is baed upon original research that of itself does not make a good hiktorical ronance but one is bound to admit that this long dramatic tale of the polish beautv madame de alewska with her aged jealous conceited beau of a huvband and her unselfish quixotic and fatal passion for napoleon carries the reader to the end with an intvrest that sldom slackens it is a subtle tragic episode the character of the heroine with her disappointed idal i9 handled with insight and vivid sympathy so are most of the minor figuresthev live and move napoleon is less attractive hi roic is senslial and selfish but the general impression left on the mind by a perusal of this fine though by no nmean great romance is distinctly one f trenth and directness in characterisation the tranilation reads fairly well but wvhv are so many spaces in the lines filled up with dots throughout the dialogue and the dtecription they have an ugly telegraphic look  flctlbtf napoleons love story by waclaw gamorowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth 6s we have read every word of this story with the greatest pleasure and interest and count de soissons claim in his brief introduction that gasiorowski though he does not bring into literature any new element is a very able master of the historical romance originated by sir walter scott is entirely justified the title alone seems a mistake napoleon either had no lovestory or he had a good many here we are concerned only with his brief passion or marie walewska a polish lady who was as good as she was beautiful and who belonged to that petite noblesse from which gasiorowski is himself sprung she bore the emperor a son alexandre walewski who afterwards became french ambassador at the court of st james represented france at the funeral of the duke of wellington and achieved a certain literary reputation he was a man with a heart of gold highminded and extraordinarily disinterested and it is evident to judge by this story that he inherited these qualities from his mother marie walewska married at twenty to a wealthy courtier of eighty conceived a romantic admiration for napoleon and the story depicts in the most moving and vivid manner her feelings when she begins to understand the real meaning of the emperors attentions that she yielded to him was a supreme act of selfsacrifice for she is led by the old polish statesman malachowski to believe that she will revive by her influence the fallen glories of her country she has a brother a humble lieutenant who learns of her shame which is at the same time the explanation of his sudden promotion to a colonelcy there is a dramatic scene between them not only does he cast her off but he throws in her face papers which contain damning proof of napoleons treachery to the polish cause to this succeeds a picture of quiet domesticity at schoenbrunn and then madame walewska is called to the deathbed of an old playmate of her childhood an officer named gorayski the emperor is bent on the austrian marriage and so a guilty colour is placed on the wholly innocent visit to gorayski and madame walewska is banished to poland not the least striking part of the book is her life when she returns to her aged husbands castle and the description of his reverential adoration of her baby son whom he always calls imperial highness we have had to pass over much that is admirable notably the scenes in paris the birth of the king of rome and the appearance of poor eleonore augier but we must mention the wonderful picture of polish society when napoleon first appears in warsawthe figures of talleyrand de segur duroc prince borghese davoust and many others mingling with the crowd of greedy courtiers and worldlywise women with whom madame walewskas native innocence and purity are strikingly contrasted yet the central allcompelling figure of the book is napoleon whether present or absent he is the determining force the masterspirit in whom every one is merged  napoleons love story by waclaw gasio rowski translated by the count de soissons duckworth  co m de soissons the translator of this romance of napoleon at warsaw tells us that the author is a napoleonic enthusiast so much may be gathered from the clear and vivid presentment of the fate of the virtuous and patriotic polish lady whose sorrows and betrayal at the hands of her ideal seem to evoke no contempt in the narrator to us it seems one of the meanest acts of one of the worlds great men poor mary walewska died for her enthusiasm  and in so doing only accentuated in her person the suffering entailed by the tyrant on the mass of her deluded countrymen the date is of course that of bonapartes presence in warsaw in 1807 when the revolutionary cloak had been abandoned and he was beginning to assimilate the pose of universal caesar the author a wellknown member of the school of sienkiewicz has given us a graphic study of polish society a century ago and the story though suffering to an english taste from rather too copious dialogue has many dramatic and some tragic passages while the characters especially that of the vain old courtier walewski are clearly cut the translation is well done but for a certain spasmodic method of conversation and a few slips of idiom,northamerica_contra
  the later years of catherine de medici reviews catherine de medici by edith sichel archibald constable and co this is an eminently readable if not a very valuable book miss sichel frankly admits in her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact and has detected no error in accepted dates she has sought to paint the portrait of catherine de medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny she says  here in paris near the louvre beneath the window whence catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of st bartholomew     or near that other window which looked out upon the fastcrimsoning seine  it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past in fact miss sichels book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts but surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities that the window of the louvre overlooking the seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the st bartholomew massacre considerably postdates that tragic event for the sake of a picture however the most vivid details are sure to be selected and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt and this makes the kind of portraiture which miss sichel practises of small worth to the student and even misleading in certain cases but the method has a value of its own it supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history it gives him more than does the historical novel and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do to the appreciation of which qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable there is a danger however that the colouring of the picture may be overdone that the perspective may be false it is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice men historians often enough fall into the same fault under the influence of political and religious bias but with women it seems impossible to avoid it women are born into the world to love and love always entails hate miss sichel is not far from hating catherine de medici and the age of the renaissance in which she lived she writes  the ligue was the counterpart of catherine we have compared it to the great french revolution but there is this vital difference between the two the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea it was the beginning of an erathe death of catherine closed an epoch with her died the age of the renaissance and with the reign of henry iv there came the dawn of modern timesit was the destiny of catherine de medici to imbibe the poison of either influence that of the reformation and that of the renaissance from the reformation she derived its abusesits degradation of religion into politics its gross polemic materialism the more pernicious for priestly vestments from the renaissance she inhaled its stagnant paganism its cold curiosity its stupid blindness to aught but the senses its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in there are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men it is the death of the ideal of faith in man of faith in anything outside him these were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others history provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but sometimes unconsciously it reveals to us certain moral laws it is a medium for them not a pulpit if any person any age is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality that age is the reign of the last valoisthat person is catherine de medici most if not all of this is fustianlittle better indeed than sheer nonsense in the first place it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras epochs ages and modern times strictly speaking there is no such thing as an era an epoch an age or modern times with every minute that goes by the middle ages for instance are getting further and further away from the middle assumingwhich is of course not the case that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end to tell us that the revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning and if miss sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the french revolution she is assuredly mistaken if anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudoclassical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movementa pseudoclassicism which by the way achieved among other things the complete destruction of the art of painting in franceat any rate for the presenta curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received especially as it is highly typical the gross polemic materialism of the reformation the more pernicious for priestly vestments is unfair to a highly complex movement one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison detre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism to accuse the renaissance of stupid blindness to aught but the senses is far too sweeping a charge and indeed a stupid one whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been the christian world owes to the renaissance an immense debt to say that catherine de medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man which he has never been without as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge is to give that good lady who had her commendable points an importance which she never possessed and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft  of the meed of immortality with miss edith sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency history she says provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page which is her last yet although for long men did not know it they were aremaking towards a common goal and using a common watchword that watchword that goal is freedom making f or  moving  is a slang expression but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist  of what use is the historian any way if he is not to be a conscious moralist with history or as much as he can find out about it as his text which is a theological text into the bargain  for the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of good over evil and in that conclusion we are entirely we think in accord with miss edith sichel,northamerica_contra
the custom of the country an idyll of the welsh mountains by john finnemore 6s lawrence and bullen the verdict of most readers of this story will be that while the custom of the country  is peculiar the customs collectively are detestable we were never brought so near to loathing of wales as in this tale and surely that is an unfortunate effect for a welsh  idyll  to produce the welsh heroine is the mother of a child when she marries austen the english hero though she has not been married before but the circumstances are such that no public or private morality has been outraged thereby a  custom of the country  covers the circumstance protectingly when the disagreeable englishwoman who is the heros mother knows the fact she is cruel margaret runs back to her father in her husbands absence and that grim old care keeps her a prisoner and dares austen to come near ha nor does margaret seem to protest austen behaves like the patient stolid englishman he is and things come right in the end but the sample of welsh manners and customs he experienced would have made him flee from the hills of the cymri as far as madagascar had he been very sensitive there is a good description of the search for the grim old father in the snow but the main narrative is unsatisfactory mr finnemore owes wales some supplementary pictures,northamerica_contra

girl forget him pretty pensiveness there will come others every day ts od as he slit j suckling 4 the approach of a wedding in a family is always an event of great importance but particularly so in a household like this in a retired part of the country master simon who is a pervading spirit and through means of the butler and housery keeper knows every thing that goes forward tells me that the maidservants are continually trying their fortunes and that the servantsmiall iias of late been quite a scene of incantation i it is amusing to notice how the oddities of tiie head of a family dow down through all the branches the squire in thc indulgence of his love of every thine that smacks of old times has held so many grave conversations with the parson at table about popular superstitions and traditional rites that they have been carried from the parlour to the kitchen by the likening doa etic and being apparently sanctioned by such high authority tiie whole house has become infected by i them  the servants are all versed in the common modes of try ing luck and the charms to ensure constancy they read their fortunes by drawing strokes in the ashes olby repeating a form of words and looking in a pail of water st marks eve i am told was a busy time with them  being an appointed night for certain mystic ceremonies several of them sowed hempseed v be reaped hy their true lovers and they even ventured upon the solemn iu fearful preparation of the dumbcake this must he done fasting and in silence 1 he ingredients are handed down in traditional form   an eggshell full of salt an eggshell full of malt and an eggshell full ol barleymeal  hen the cake is ready it is put upon a pan over tiie tire ancl the future husband will appear turn the cake and retire but if a word is spoken or a fast is broken during this awful ceremony there is no knowing what horrible consequences would ensue  the experiments in the present instance came to no result they that sowed the hempseed forgot the magic rhyme that they were to pronounce so the true lover never appeared  and as to the dumbictke what between the awful stillness they had to keep and the awfulness of the midnight hour their hearts failed them when they had put the cake in the pan  so that on the striking ol the great houseclock in the sei vantvhall they wt ic seized with  ycddcu panic and van c ci tooi  t tilm the cid not return until morning when they found the mystic cake burnt to a cinder 9 the most persevering at these spells however is phoebe wilkins the hou keepers niece as she is a kind of privjl leged personage and rather idle she has more time to occupy herself with these matters she has always had her head full of love and matrimony she knows the dreambook by heart and is quite an oracle among the little girls ofthe family who always come to her to interpret their dreams in the mornings  during the present gaiety of the house however the poor girl has worn a face full of trouble  and to use the housekeepers words  has fallen into a sad hystericky way lately it seems that she was born and brought up in the village where her father was parish clerk and she was an early playmate and sweetheart of young jack tibbets since she has come to live at the hall however her head has been a little turned being very pretty and naturally genteel she has been much noticed and indulged and being the housekeepers niece she has held an equivocal station between a servant and a companion she has learned something of fashions and notions among the young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis insomuch that her finery at church on sundays has given mortal offence to her former intimates in the village this has occasioned the misrepresentations which have awakened the implacable family pride of dame tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a spice of coquetry in her disposition showed it on one or two occasions to her lover which produced a downright quarrel and jack being very proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back upon her for several successive sundays  the poor girl is full of sorrow and repentance and would fain make up with lier lover  but he feels his security and stands aloof in this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother who is continually reminding him what he owes to his family for this same family pride seems doomed to be the eternal bane ct lovers  as i hate to sec a pretty lace in trouble 1 have felt quite concerned for thc luckless phoebe ever since i heard i er story it is a sad thing to be thwarted rn love at any time but particularly so at this tender season of the year when every living thine even to the very butterfly is sporting with its mate and the green fields and the budding groves and the singing of the birds and the sweet smell of the howers are enough to turn the head of a lovesick girl i am told that the coolness of young readymoney p very heavy at poor phoebes heart instead of singing about the house as formerly she goes about pale and sighing ana is apt to break into tears when her companions arc full of merriment   mrs hannah the vesta gentlewoman  of mv lddv lihycraft ha had long ua alld walks with phoebe up and down the avenue of an evening and has endeavoured to squeeze some of her own verjuice into the others milky nature she speaks with contempt and abhorrence of the whole sex and advises phoebe to despise ail the men as heartily as she does but phoebes loving temper is not to be curdled she has no such thing as hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole composition she has all thc simple fondness of heart of poor weak loving woman and her only thoughts at present are how to conciliate and reclaim her wayward swain 1 the spells and lovecharms which are matters of sport to the other domestics are serious concerns with this lovestricken damsel she is continually trying her fortune in a variety of ways i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six wednesdays and three fridays successively having understood that it was a sovereign charm to ensure being married to ones liking within the year she carriesabout also a lock of her sweethearts hair and a ribbon he once gave her being a mode of producing constancy ina lover she even went so far as to try her fortune by the moon which has always had much to do with loverv dreams and fancies tor this purpose she went out in the night of the full moon knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the od traditional rhvme  i  all hail to thee moon all hail to thee 1 pray thee good moon now show to me the youth who my future husband shall be  when she came back to the house she was faint and pale and went immediately to bed the next morning she told the porters wife that she had seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow which she was sure was young tibbets  at any rate she had dreamed of him all night both of which the old dame assured her were most happy signs it has since turned out that the person in the jneadow was old christy the huntsman who was walking his nightly rounds with the great staghound  so that phoebes faith in the charm is completely shaken 9 a village politician  i am a rogue if i do not think i was designed for the helm of state  i am so full of nimble stiatagems that i should have ordered affairs and carried it against the stream of a faction with as much case as a skipper would laver  against the wind tue goblins  in one of my visits to the village with master simon he proposed that we should stop at the inn which he wished to show nie as a specimen of a real country inn the head quarters of village gossip i had remarked it before in my perambulations about the place it has a deep oldfashioned porch leading into a large hall which serves for taproom and travellersjoom  having a wide tireplace with high backed settles on each side where the wise men of the village gossip over their  e and hold their sessions during the j og v inter evening jhe uudloid i aa i easy indolent fellow shaped a little like one of his own beer barrels and is apt to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on one side n 1 his hands in his pockets whilst his wife and daughter attend to customers his wife however is fully competent to manage the establishment and indeed from long habitude rules over all the frequenters of the taproom as completely as if they were her dependants instead of her patrons not a veteran alebibher but pays homage to her having no doubt been often in her arrears i have already hinted that she is on very good terms with readymoney jack he was a sweetheart of hers in early life and has always countenanced the tavern on her account indeed he is quite the  cock of the walk at the taproom  as we approached the inn we heard some one talking with great voiubilityand distinguishing the ominous words  taxes  poors rates and  agricultural distress it proved to be a thin loquacious fellow who had penned the landlord up in one corner of the porch with his hands in his pockets as usual listening with an air of the most vacant acquiescence  the sight seemed to have a curious effect on master simon as he squeezed my arni and altering his course sheered wide of the porch as though he had not any idea of entering this evident evasion induced me to notice the orator more particularly he was meagre but active in his make with a long pale bilious face  a black beard so illshaven as to bloody his shirtcollar a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at the sides into a most pragmatical shape he had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction of mine host  at sight of master simon the landlord was evidently a little flurried and began to rub his hands edge away from his corner and make several profound publican bows while the orator took no other notice of my companion than to talk rather louder than before and with as i thought something of an air of defiance master simon however as i have before said sheered off from the porch and passed on pressing my arm within his and whispering as we got by in a tone of awe and horror  thats a radical he reads cobbelt  1 endeavoured to get a more particular account of him from my companion but he seemed unwilling even to talk about him answering only in general terms that he was  a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded trick of talking and was apt to bother one about the national debt and such nonsense9 from which 1 suspected that master simon had been rendered wary of him bv some accidental   rn encounter on the held of argument for these radicals are continually roving about in quest of wordy warfare and never so happy as when they can tilt a gentleman logician out of his addle  on subsequent inquiry my tupiciou have been cooirmed i find the radical has but recently found his way ioto the village where he threatens to commit fearful devastations with his doctrines he has already made two or taree complete converts or new lights he shake tiie faith of several others and hnartevously puzzled the brains of many of the oldest villagers who had never thought about politics or scarce any thing else during their whole lives  he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness of mind and body worrying about with newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has shocked several of the staunchest villagers by talk ing lightly of the squire and his family and hinting that it would be better the park should be cut up into small farms and kitchengardens or feed good mutton instead of worthless deer  he is a great thorn in the side of the squire who is sadly afraid that he will introduce politics into the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking community he is a still greater grievance to master simon who has hitherto been abie to sway the political opinions of the place without much cost of learning or logic but has been very much puzzled of late to weed out the doubts and heresies already sown by this champion of reform indeed the latter has taken complete command at the taproom ofthe tavern not so much because he has convinced as because he has outtalked all the old established oracles the apothecary with all his philosophy was as nought before him he has convinced and converted the landlord at least a dozen times who however is liable to be convinced and converted the other way by the next person with whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king master simon and the squire she now and thea comes out upon the reformer with all the fierceness of a catomouutain and does not spare her own softheaded husband for listening to what she terms such  lowlived politics what makes the good woman the more violent is the perfect coolness with which the radical listens ta her attacks drawing his face up into a provoking supercilious smile and when she has talked herself out of breath quietly asking her for a taste of her houicbreej the only person that is in any way a match for this redoubtable politician is readymoney jack tibbet who maintains his stand in the taproom in defiance of the radical and all his works jack is one of the most loyal men in the country without being able to reason about the matter he has that admirable quality for a tough arguer also that he never knows when he is beat he has half a dozen old maxims which he advances on all occasions and though his antagonist mav overturn them never so often yet he alwav brings them anew to the ricld he is like the robber in ariosto who though his head might be cut off half a hundred times yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling and returned as sound a man as ever to the charge whatever does not square with jacks simple and obvious creed he sets down for  french politics for notwithstanding the peace he cannot be persuaded that the french are not still laying plots to ruin the nation and to get hold of the bank of england the radical attempted to overwhelm him one day by a long passage from a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes in newspapers in reply he gave him one ofthe stanzas which he has by heart from his favourite and indeed only author old tusser and which he calls hisgolden rules  leave princes affairs undcscauted on and tend to such doings as stand thee upon  fear god and offend not the king nor his laws and keep thyself out ofthe magistrates claws when tibbets had pronounced this wilh great emphasis he pulled out a well lilied leathern purse took out a handful of gold and silver paid his score at the bar with great punctuality returned his money piece by piece into his purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned up  and then giving his cudgel a stout thump upon the tloor and bidding the radical  good morning sir  with the tone of a man who conceives he has completely done for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity out of the house two or three of jacks admirers who were present and had been afraid to take the field themselves looked upon this as a perfect triumph and winked at each other when the radicals back was turned  ay ay said mine host as soon as the radical was out of hearing let old jack alone  ill warrant hell give him his own 1  some of mr irvines sketches are much in the manner of the characters of theophrastus and the microcosmographia of bishop earl  we shall conclude for tiie present with

whole country or kingdom over theres liberty thc birds of the air can take no morejovial crew since the meeting with the gipsies which 1 have related in a former paper 1 have observed several of them haunting the purlieus of the hall in spite of a positive interdiction of the squire they are part of a gang that has long kept about this neighbourhood to the great annoyance of the farmers whose poultryyards often suffer from their nocturnal invasions  the mention of this work reminds us of a hoax that has been played on some of the morning and country newspapers who have reprinted several of bishop earles characters as co pied from an old ms just discovered and northeast rr hf fore pridedln they are however in some measure patronised by the squire who considers the race as belonging to the good old times  which to confess the private truth seems to have abounded with goodfornothing characters this roving crew is called  starlight toms gang from the name of its chieftain a notorious poacher i have heard repeatedly ofthe misdeeds of this minion ofthe moon for every midnight depredation that takes place in farm or fold or farmyard is laid to his charge starlight tom in fact answers to his name he seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be traced in the morning bv the  mj mi mischief he has done he reminds me of that fearful personage inthenursery rhime  who goes round the house at night  none but bloody tom who steals all the sheep at night  none but one bv one  in shortstarlight tom is the scapegoat ofthe neighbourhood but so cunning and adroit that there is no detecting him old christy and the gamekeeper have watched many a night in hopes of entrapping him and christy often patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose but all in vain it is said that the squire winks hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feeling towards the vagabond because of wu being very expert at all kinds of games a great shot willi the crossbow and the best morrisdancer in the country  the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested about the skirts of his estate on condition that they do not come about the house the approaching wedding however has made a kind of saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension of all sober rule it has produced a great sensation throughout the female part of the household  hot a housemaid but dreams of wedding favours and has a husband running in her head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies  there is a public footpath leading across one part of the park by which they have free ingress and they are continually hovering about the grounds telling the servant girls fortunes or getting smuggled in to the young ladies  i believe the oxonian amuses himself very much by furnishing them with hints in private and bewildering all the weak brains m the house with their wonderful revelations the general certainly was j very much astonished by the communica i tions made to him the other evening by j the gypsy girl he kept a wary silence to j wards us on the subject and alfected to treat it lightly  but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his attentions to lady lillvcraft and her dogs  i have seen also phoebe wilkins thc  housekeepers pretty and lovesick niece holding a long conference with one of these old sybils behind a large tree in the avenue and often looking round to see that she was not observed 1 make no i doubt that she was endeavouring to get some favourable auzurv about the result of her lovequarrel with young ready money as oracles have ahvavs been more consulted on loveaffairs than upon anv thing else i fear however that in thinstance the response was not so ftvoura hie as usual for i perceived poor phoebe returning pensively towards the househer head hangingdown her hat in her hand and the ribbon trailing along the ground  at another time as i turned a corner of a terrace at the bottom of the garden just by a clump of trees and a large stone urn i came upon a bery of the young girls of the family attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was at a loss to comprehend the meaning of their blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation until i saw the red cloak of a gypsy vanishing among the shrubbery a few moments after i caught sight of master simon and the oxonian stealing along one of the walks of the garden chuckling and laughing at their successful waggerv having evidently put the gypsy up to the thing and instructed her what to say  after all there is something strangely pleasing in these tamperings with the future even where we are convinced of the fallacy of the prediction it is singular how willingly the mind will half deceive itself and with what a degree of awe we will listen even to these babblers about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry with these poor vagabonds that seek to deceive us into bright hopes and expectations i have always been something of a castle builder and have found my liveliest pleasures to arise from the illusions which fancy has cast over commonplace realities as i get on in life i find it more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful manner and i should be thankful to any prophet however false that would conjure the clouds which hang over futurity into palaces and all its doubtful regions into fairyland 9 the squire who as i have observed has a private good will towards gipsies has suffered considerable annoyance on their account not that they requite h indulgence with ingratitude for they do not depredate very flagrantly on his estate but because their pilfering and misdeeds occasion loud murmurs in the village 1 can readily understand the old gentlemans humour on this point i have a j great toleration for all kinds of vagrant j sunshiny existence and must confess i  take a pleasure in observing the ways ot j gipsies the english who are accustomed to them from childhood and often suffer from their petty depredations consider them as mere nuisances but i have been very much struck with their peculiarities i like to behold their dear olive complexions their romantic black eves their raven locks their lithe slender n gures and to hear them in low silver tones dealing forth magnificent promjjs of honours and estates of world s ean and ladies love     their mode of life too has sometime iii it very fanciful and picturesque they are the free denizens of nature and maintain a primitive independence in spite of law and gospel of county gaols and country magistrates it is curious to see this obstinate adherence to the wild unsettled habits of savage life transmitted from generation to generation and preserved in the midst of one of he most cultivated populous and systematic countries in the world they are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people about them they seem to be like the indians of america cither above or below tiie ordinary cares ami anxieties of mankind heedless of power of honours of wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations of the times the rise or fail of grain or stock or empires tiiev seem to latish at the toiling fretting world around them and to live according to the philosophy of the old song   a who would ambition

beautiful spot either a green shady nook of a road or on the border of a common under a sheltering hedge  or on the skirts of a line spreading wood they are always to be found lurking about fairs and

the dop doctor by richard dehan heinemann 6  richard delian  is a pseudonym and we believe the identity of the author is still a secret he has written a remarkable book it opens on a note of the wildest melodrama but after twenty pages or so it brings us to the chief scene of the book a town presumably mafeking which is undergoing siege in the south african war and his narrative begins at once to enthral the author knows the feeling of war and this war in particular and he reproduces the atmosphere ot it the dop doctor himself is a noteworthy character a brilliant reforming drunkard whose career is again not quite free from melodrama but nevertheless presented in a most lifelike and ingratiating form the colonel in command and the lady superior are drawn with no less skill the book is far too diffuse but it combines a certain humanity devilry and even wisdom which serve to fix and keep our attention,northamerica_contra
rubaiyat of omar khayyam rendered into enzlish verse 2s 6d net macmillan to put fitzgeralds masterpiece within the reach of almost everyone who wants to read it is so much a matter for gratitude that the publishers may expect there should be no admixture of criticism in the reception given to its issue in the favourite golden treasury series we have in truth much to be grateful for we are given the fourth edition and the first with a list of variations between the second third and fourth versions the form is pretty and convenient but in a popular edition we should like something more we are not al members of the omar club we cannot read all the books that have dealt with the persian original nor follow through many volumes the lore that would tell us how far fitzgerald tampered with his model a short summary of the results of recent research should have been prefixed and save in the editors note there is no mention of fitzgerald at all i yet the book in its cheap form will fall into new hands quite outside the wellinformed literary circles doubtless it reflects too closely the latent philosophy of the day not to be received with profound interest by fresh readers for their sakes

introduction by r whiteing 6s heinemann mr whiteing describes this book as  the statement of the basis of observation on which m verestchagin has founded his great series of pictures illustrative of the campaign the  basis of observation  is in the main quite sound and to all admirers of the russian painter his notes must be deeply interesting even nonadmirers will find them graphic and terse verestchagin has made a great impression on the english mind because he is a painter with a declared obvious consistent purpose that it is not directly an artistic purpose is all the better for his repute among us he is a vigorous moralist a striking personality mr whiteing would have been better employed in emphasising that than in making claims for him as an artist that cannot for a moment be upheld on the artistic side he is far from despicable but for all his distinction as a man he is not one of the eminent painters of europe and to treat him as a pioneer in realism is absurd  rubaiyat

of the arab persian or central asiatic writer who has earned high distinction among eastern poets as it is to certify which of the detached pieces attributed to him are really his own and the case of omar khayyam of nishapur supplies no exception to the rule fortunately for the reputation of this particular bard there has risen at the present day a new generation of english orientalists distinguished by thoroughness of performance as well as fullness of promise who seem bent on giving us on his behalf something more than a patchwork portrait or such frontispiece to his writings as would satisfy the ordinary and unexacting western critic enlightened and encouraged on one side by the research of russian savants and on the other by though enterprise of american publishers they carry on their labours with a sober enthusiasm and quiet tenacity of purpose which cannot fail to bear good fruit so that almost before the close of the passing century we may reasonably expect to

workers in a scantily peopled field in mr nathan haskell doles fairly exhaustive compilation the reader must not expect to find necessarily much new light or new matter it is practically a summary of

there is much of interest in the notes essays and reviews by which the anglicised or europeanized verse is accompanied but any analysis of papers mostly printed years ago would be manifestly out of place at the present time and we may content ourselves with congratulating the able compiler on the value of his reproductions and the uses he has made of them if we venture to take exception to the assertion that thanks to the attention bestowed upon his writings by modern european critics  old omar stands clearly outlined before our vision and that  if he should teappear in our day it would be as a leader of modern thought we do so under the impression that notwithstanding all that has been said and conjectured about him we have not yet attained to a full appreciation of his already published writings moreover the notion of his reappearance amongst us as a successful uptodate teacher implies a certain experience of the later world which could hardly be acquired by intuition and which even an omar khayyam could not afford to ignore the section described as  comparative versions of the rubaiyat constitutes fitzgerald a kind of fugleman to the corps of translatorsthat is to say his rendering of the supposed original leads the way and gives as it were the cue to others but as might have been anticipated the position is not maintained fitzgeralds genius was never trammelled by adherence to a rigid text and it soon becomes apparent that each expositor abandoning his imaginative and erratic leader follows out his own method of interpreting the persian manuscript in the order

of prof cowells labours more especially for republishing that eminent scholars contribution to vol xxx of the calcutta review it is pleasant to recall how favourable and yet well poised is the professors estimate of the author of the rubaiyat as shown in the following extract  we find some excuse for his errors if we remember though state of the world at that time his clear strong sense revolted from the prevailing mysticism where all the earnest spirits of the age found their refuge and his honest independence was equally shocked by the hypocrites who aped their fervour and enthusiasm and at that dark hour of mans history whither out of islam was the thoughtful mohammedan to repair  no missionarys step bringing good tidings had appeared on the mountains of persia  the few christians who might cross his path in his native land would only seem to him idolaterschristianity came before omar only in the form of the first crusade unless oriental chronology is hopelessly misleading in regard to local history this must indeed have been about the period in which omar khayyam flourished and it is probable that the crusaders made their victorious entry into jerusalem under godfrey de bouillon shortly before his death though we have no evidence to affirm that he took the same exalted view of christianity as his religious brother and predecessor albiruni who spoke of its tenets with an admiration quite exceptional in the case of a votary of islam he could for the occasion pray with his fellowmen not only outside the precincts of the mosque but without the aid of a mohammedan spiritual guide his pen thus bears testimony on the subject wanting the rose the thorn well might avail wanting the day i make dark night avail wanting praise prayer and sheikh prescribd by rule i make church bells and christian rite avail and now before closing our brief notice of mr doles compilation we may appropriately take note of some three or four rubaiyat significant of a higherclass omar much has been said of our astronomerpoets freethinking his cynicism his restless allusions to an unalterable destiny but in how few of his stanzas have his warmest admirers or most sympathetic interpreters attempted to bring out an underlying christian spirit which is by no means quite occult or to be sought for only between the lines of his verse surely the two following quatrains taken from whinfields translation possess a sufficient flavour of christianity to acquit their author of any wholesale charge of irreligion or infidelity  whateer thou doest never grieve thy brother nor kindle fumes of wrath his peace to smother dost thou desire to taste eternal bliss vex thine own heart but never vex another  today is thine to spend but not tomorrow  counting on morrows

original and which are excellent enough to go beyond the second edition now published retain fairly the metre and meaning of the persian but translators like doctors disagree and this disagreement is often evident in small things for instance in lines breathing the same spirit as those last quotod we find according to mr garner the mosque the kaba tis a prison cell a chain the chimes that from the steeple swell the rosary the mehrab and the church are like the cross all signs of slavery fell according to mr whinfield the lines are thus rendered in english  pagodas just as mosques are homes ot

anglicised the same number of times by prayer is here a service of worship without relation to imprisonment chains or any outward sign of slavery mr whinfields footnote affirming that the meaning

phases of an inferior planet fiction by ellen glasgow heinemann 6s tnis is a new york story of bohemian art life the  chief fault is that the author has so passionately concentrated herself on the two leading characters that the minor  figures are carelessly imagined and drawn without force or originality but it will be read for its extraordinary  and pitiless analysis of a very woman of the time the effect achieved is one of unrelieved misery for ourselves we say franklyand it is a tribute in a way to the writers powerthat we regret having opened it so painful was the depression it left behind the life of everyone is in large measure a struggle against pessimism and melancholy and contains sorrow enough without calling in this ill omened prophet to destroy the last germ of hope for that is the conclusion of the whole matter mariana passes through ali the deep experiences of life and finds nothing but illusion she wins such a love as might be thought to redeem any existence from despair yet it leads but to deeper sorrows motherhood yields no consolation it seemed inexplicable to her that women went on travailing and giving birth that a woman who had once known the agony of maternity should consent to bear a second a third or a fourth child struck her as ridiculous she closed her eyes and laughed the experienced novelreader needs no telling that a story written in this

and faced the messenger his words came thickly there is no time to lose he said lam ready with this message and the moral underlying it the book  abruptly ends it is not to be disputed that ellen glasgow has obtained a brilliant success if her aim was to impress the miserable doctrine that life is not worth living were such a mournful philosophy well founded its dissemination could only end in discouragement and decay but her insight is not equal to her powers of observation the best of her work is largely made up of externals and the reader cannot help feeling at the salient points in the career of her hero and heroine that there must have been in their lives much more than comes within her ken every thinker has moments of despair but none has attained real greatness who has cast the shadow of these over all life  we bid you to hope was the final message of the greatest writer of this century and one cannot help thinking that the latterday lady novelist would not be so gloomy and

difficult their married life is disastrously broken by poverty and the death of the child and mariana leaves her husband to despair which somehow ends in the agnostic becoming a ritualist priest the transition is accounted for by the necessity of working on philanthropic lines for works sake  but it is as little convincing as marianas neurotic incompetence or the late reconciliation there is

exasperatingly clever exasperatingly incapable books which are produced so frequently today there is no grip of life in it and there is intellect in abundance the writer has a sense of style and she

fascinations and only her death saves his cutting his pastorship and running off with her to the sunny south the story is aimless nonsense but in the detail there is a surprising amount of ability the writer has a real power of sketching a character in a word or two as here for example wiss ramsey belonged to that numerous army of women who fulfil life as they fulfil an appointment at the

the hero in his boyhood is present and you have all that has any thing to do with him in his capacity of page or with the  court to compensate for this the book is full of other personalities but for

house of still greater antiquity and distinction than his own clandestinely though nobody would have been better pleased with the match than his parents this occurred at the commencement of the french revolution and to get out of the way of impending danger the beverleys remove to rome where in a few weeks the young man is found murdered and on examining his papers his connexion with mademoiselle davrancourt is discovered the lady is understood to be in the family way and to save the scion of their son no time is lost in flying to paris though too late to save the mother the child is miraculously rescued and identified marked on the breast with a bloody hand stamped by the mothers terrors before its birth at the sight of her fiathers murder she herself was guillotined betrayed by a near relation for the sake of the estate and title this ferocious wretch has rushed into the worst horrors of the revolution and was conspicuous among the roost ruxffianly of the reign of terror here then are laid the foundations of mystery and the materials for unravelling it obviously prepared the child is brought up by the beverleys as the heir of their title and estate without proofs of legitimate birth  and as to the french property here is one whose interest it is no legitimate heir should appear with villainy enough to dare the worst to prevent it for a time however all goes smoothly the boy apparently the grandfathers successor is educated by the curate of the parish who has a lovely daughter of young arthurs own age and as they grow up naturally fall in love with each other luckily her mother had been of the noblesse and the beverleys now earl and countess of roxmere are liberal and care not for fortune they are willing it should be a match but as the parties are yet young arthur prepares to join the army for a campaign or two and lady roximere adopts lucy the parsons daughter and takes her home still restrained by lady roxmere arthur has given no pledgelhe may change his mind and it is right young as he is hie should leave himself at liberty suddenly on the very eve of his departure he is seized by a party of ruffianly fellows and carried in a most tempestuous night on board a boat which after long tossing is capsized and he is thrown back upon the shore apparently lifeless the source of this seizure was of course the treacherous and bloodthirsty frenchman recovering however the youth now sets out a campaigning and in his absence folks are busy at homeespecially a match making dame of quality who has two girls to dispose of to prevent his marriage with the parsons daughter and secure the prize for one of her own she continues to keep up a little interesting correspondence with him and so successfully that on his return two

treatedbut luckily by the greatest chance in the world a day or two before the intended marriage at a masquerade arthur discovers the bride elect to be engaged with a man of notorious profligacy in an intrigue which had been carried beyond the common limits of discretion this discovery of course puts an end to the marriage and to divert his chagrin arthur resolves to return to the peninsula and making previously a confidant of the duke of york he departs in spite of all remonstrance on the part of the roxmeres who would have had him stay at homne and take to lucy again but his destiny must be run in spain he is taken prisoner and while with the french army he comes in contact with his french enemy who being in favour and power readily gets him into his own hands but instead of killing

have been found for some exaggeration in the exploiting of the abundant humour but a wise restraint has saved the reader from wading through a mass of dialectical gibberish such as many writers of celtic stories would have us believe is the modern speech of irish men and women of the educated classes a thread of romance runs through the story which is told in witty and brilliant dialogue full of delicate subtleties which stipple in the excellent characterisation katherine rowan the heroine develops a passion for hunting and rents a place in south munster with mrs delanty a widow of

my hearts in thc highlands by the author 1 of i utbrown maids parker son  13ourn the fault of this story is that it is written with a pedantry of imitation the period is the middle of the last century and the author has been content to read and quote dr johnsons tour and to talk of novels instead of becoming identified with the scenes and people with whom the story is connected the book might quite well have been written by one who had never seen the highlands and the reader is needlessly referred to books to support the author in actions and incidental traits which occur in the story if however the reader can get over the stiff halting gait at which the story proceeds he will find much to interest and amuse indeed when he closes the book he will be surprised to find how much more he has been interested than he was aware of the fortunes of the different families of the glen will win on his sympathy while fimalia with his questionable antecedents and his worship of mary adour is akin to young mauprat with his love for edine in george sands novel though we confess to feeling more interest with the highland fimalia than ever we had with the evil young baron there is a great deal of careful writing and painstaking attention in the highland story we prefer it to the authors former work  nutbrown maids and we think our readers will be of the same persuasion if the author would eee more and go less to books for inspirations of time and fashions the story which would result would be worth reading,northamerica_contra

north of the tweed or lorance langton his life incidents and adventures in scotland by daniel crowberry 3 vols newby we have been highly amused with this book not that the author intended it to be funny far from it indeed it is the authors perfect unconsciousness of saying anything humorous that makes us laugh so the book is written with such profound gravity and selfcomplacency that what would otherwise be insufferable becomes very amusing we remember a parallel case some time ago there was an   i flr    amateur representation of  macbeth to which the numerous friends of the actors were compelled to go with anything but lively anticipations of enjoyment to their delight what was expected to bea most tedious affair turned out a perfect success macbeth was so wonderfully  got up and delivered his speeches with such preternatural solemnity and was evidently so delighted with himself and his acting that the audience roared again every syllabic he uttered caused shouts of laughter much to his astonishment but s hestillweuton in thc sam style he unwittingly kept up the fun to thc end of the enteiiaiinitnt by these means a badlyacted tragedy became a most enjoyable farce so hero thanks to our appreciation ot the humorous a tedious novel is made really amusing were it not for this we fear our criticism would be more severe as it is though author is perfectly safe we cannot find much fault with a book that has made us laugh so the author says in the third volume of  north of the tweed that it is not a novel at all perhaps this is some peculiar fun of mr crowberry some joke known only to a few for if it is not a novel what is it we really cannot say it certainly is not a book of travels nor a book of anecdotes it is perhaps best described as an edd and not very agreeable mixture of the three things the first volume so lav as we can judge was apparently intended for a novel at any rate there is some appearance of a tale  but to the readers surprise and our amusement this story comes to an abrupt termination at the end of the volume the second volume has no reference to the firstnor in faet t lung at all iii particular the hero of the first volume certainly appears iu though second but that is the only connexion between them it puzzles us to make out what mr crowberry intended the second volume to be we have thought over it and as a puzzle it h amusing but it beats us we cannot understand what it means it is such a curious medley that it must be read to be appreciated we warn the reader though that tue only entertainment he can hope to find is in wondering at the incongruities and pomposity of style beyond this he will be bored in the third volume the author takes another stait and having satisfied his taste for meandering in the second volume rathor inclines to give his audience another story this intention however is not strictly carried out for the meandering continue at diverse intervals throughout the last volume but still there is some kind of reference to a talc for which the reader will feel grateful or not according to his taste even the author shows once in the como of his work symptoms of an idea that it is not quite cn rijlc to drag into his novel stray anecdoteof about eighty pages or so wliei it has not the remotest connexion with what precedes and follows it and when mr crowberry himself owns that it is not amusing this remarkable once occurs at page 172 of the third volume we specify it thus particularly as it possesses a certain interest for though philosophical critic it proves that even though most eccentric author has occasional glimpses of right and wrong in reference to his novel just as the most depraved criminal occasionally exhibits signs of penitence and remorse so the author at this remarkable page 172 shows that even he knows what crimes he has been guilty of as a novelwriter this is what mr crowberry says   were we now engaged in writing a novel  it would become our first consideration to choose or invent such incidents for our work as seemed best calculated to sustain an uniform interest or stimulate the curiosity of those who honoured us with their favour such may be termed the high or popular road of romance but as we are occupied in recording a succession of humble events either relating personally to the subject of our narrative or coming directly under his observation in the courso of his rambling life ice are constrained to dealicith matters as they come before us commonplace as they may seem the present incident    possesses nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or cen to a place in our pages nothing beyond the actual fact of its existence enid of having attained consielereible notoriefy at the time of its occurrence observe in the beginning of this quotation how the guilty author tries to excuse himself while confessing his crime how natural this is  no man ever acknowledged himself guilty of a crime without a reservation the confession always nins  i know i did it but and the  but clearly proves it was some one elses fault that the crime in question was committed but what does mr crowberry mean by saying were we now engaged in writing a novel really when we listen to excuses like this we feel quite inclined to lose our good humour and be severe how can mr crowberry be so cool as to say that he is  constrained to deal with matters as they come before him commonplace as they may seem   who constrains him  certainly not the public in fact we cannot see how an englishman can be compelled to write a book though he had even contracted to do so the court of chancery itself would never decree specific performance of a contract to write a book it may be different in scotland  but even if it be so the courts in scotland ought clearly not to have constrained mr crowberry to publish his book in england there must be some mistake somewhere seriously mr crowberry is in this dilemma either he wrote to please the public or to please himself and a few friends in the first case it is clear he ought not to have wilfully written trash that he knew to be uninteresting to the public generally in though second case mr crowberry should have printed a few copies for private circulation when he published the book to the world the excuse as to his being compelled to write nonsense fell to the ground  for though he and his friends may prefer uninteresting and disconnected stories they have no right to force their peculiar taste on the public at large to conclude mr crowberry ought not to spoil a good confession by frivolous excuses the simple truth is the author knew to use his own words that the incident possessed nothing in itself to commend it to the special attention of the reader or even to a place in his pages yet out of pure obstinacy he inserted it i knew i ought not to stead that coat and yet i did steal it that is the authors confession,northamerica_contra

and ot two novels the wooings of jezebel pettyfer and  the masterfolk and if these two last are not the most remarkable of his works they are none the less among the most remarkable novels of recent years this new and carefully revised reissue of his first book reminds one of the deservedlyiine things that were said of it on its first appearance and elf the instant success it achieved with the reading public of a decade or miore ago it is a wonderfully intimate and realistic tale of the uest indies written from the personal acquaintance mr mlacfall made with the place and its people when he held a commission in a wvest indian regimneutand its vzivid minutely faithful pictures of negro character alone make it a book of more than common merit but beyond this it unfolds an excellent story of the life of one negro in particular in all his relations with the men and women of his own colour and of the dominant white race and it works out a great ethical problem fearlessly with humour and pathos and mordant irony mr m1acfalls creed is that though celibacy is nearly as harmful to the race as promiscuity  the main who lives chastely and faithful to his mate is of the elect and the nation that holds his like holds the dominion over the wvorld he enforces this view ably cunningly with a ripe narrative skill and understanding of humanity his psychological study of an average west indian negro is clever and subtle and the powerful story he weaves about him revealing the superstitions the good nature the broad humour and nonmioral character of his kind touched with gayest lighlts and sombre shadows is everywhere alive with interest we wvelcome this new edition of an original and striking book and look to see a large access to the number of its readers  the wooings2of jezebel pettyfer by haldane macfall bf richards from the first paragraph this novel must arrest the attention of sulc as care for good writing in their fiction and are sensi tive to power and truth in the description of the external world it is altogether an exceptional book original interesting and mostly repulsive the repulsion arises from the fact that we are not quite convinced of the accuracy of mr mcfalls presentation of human nature among barbados negroes now and again we have a suspicion that the observation is coloured by the prejudgments of a fix de sick mind that some characters and some situations are tortured to produce a kind of morbid humour and to shake our sentimental ignorance of the negro by any means we may be quite wrong the proper sequel to such a novel is an unimaginative study of the coloured people of the west indies and we hope it may be forthcoming mr mcfalls fantastic pictures present them not as the simple children we have hitherto thought them but as subtle sophisticated clever rascals very amusing and hopelessly sometimes unpleasantly immoral there is nothing commonplace about his book and in it there is nothing by itself really dull but he piles up evidence and incidents and talk in an endless fashion so that his greatest admirers must perforce skip many pages as there is no particnlar plan they will not therefore lose much of the general effect of this puzzling clever but too lengthy book whose author proves himself to be at once humourist sensationmonger and philosopher,northamerica_contra
  oh what a plague ta love  by katharine tynan hinkson black tins is a light and pleasant tale wholesome and fresh written with the ease and grace and charm and laziness that make mrs hinkson such a provoking writer she possesses so many gifts that if she would she could write something more lasting than the sketches with which she is content to amuse us probably if mrs hinkson chose to explain herself she would say that she doe not take her prose writing very seriously and indeed this is self  evident when au aversion a misunderstanding and a sprained ankle make up her story and there is no attempt at mystery any schoolboy or at least any schoolgirl would know from the very first that arthur strange ways opposition to beatrice challoner will end in love but this transparency detracts very little from our interest the story is told so prettily the characters are all so fresh and lifelike and the atmosphere is so young and innocent that the lack of excitement is not felt and having little to say mrs hinkson has said it briefly her story is meant to while away an hour and to be read at a sitting,northamerica_contra

mortimer collins london hurst  blackett a clhronicle of thie peirnots iorace walpole in love by ai i m1ahony matthew stradling 2 vols london sampson low it is not easy at first sight to say why it should be considered a reproach to call a novelist sentimental and a compliment rather than otherwise to call him or her impassioned novels are supposed to be chiefly valuable as representations of different varieties of human nature and sen timent is as real an element in human nature as passion and perhaps a rather more common one so that it might seem to have at least an equal right to representation the source of the prejudice is to be found probably in a vague but not quite baseless belief that sentiment is more likely in pro portion than passion to find an unreal or false expression the representation of passion is subject to control or verification by the necessity of giving a credible account both of the person by whom the passion is felt and of the object by which it is inspired for it is only when both these are made clearly conceivable that the relation between them or the passion itself appears real and natural to the spectator if the circumstances described are those which in real life would stir deep emotions to which the characters in the romance appear insensible the work is commonly sensational if on the other hand the writer succeeds in representing men and women in considerable agitation of mind without provocation or upon pro vocation which would naturally induce a different kind of agitation from that exhibited the work may be called sentimental as fairly as if it had been deliberately intended for a representation of sentiment which is simply passion unattached a disposition to feel strongly about something or other with a degree of obtuseness as to the comparative claims of the different things about which human beings are supposed to be capable of feeling to excite the sentiment which the author chances to be able most easily to re produce iu two liftle wooden shoes ouida as usual does not get beyond a kind of sentimentalism which is however sufficiently effective to make it worth while to ask why on reflection the effect is always felt to be tricky and unsatisfactory the reason we inmagine is that the author aims directly at exciting in her readers the sentiment which she conceives to be appropriate to the situation always the same which she pre fors to treat instead of representing the situation itself with such commanding truth and power as to ensure a response of some kind even in readers who may take a different view of the situation from herself the consequence is that the situation is never realised at all even by the author and that which is realised by her and more or less effectively communicated to a con genial reader is a sentiment wandering at large amongst impossible occasions and therefore never more than half true tolifeand nature in the present instance the sentiment to be communicated is one of ianguidly reproachful acquiescence in the order of nature which causes a dreamy little flowergirl to come to an untimely end like one of her own rosebuds or as the author puts it having confidence enough in the theory to lay it down with epigrammatic generality m men are true children and women are their rosebuds now ouida notwithstanding a genuine fondness for children which is one of the pleasantest traits in her writings has never made the discovery that a healthy child is the most unsentimental of beings exactly because all its experiences are concrete and particular and if she had further been able to believe that in this respect the child is generally father to the man her heroes would have less of the appearance of being created a priori as the purely ideal correla tives of a natural disposition on the part of flowergirls and novelists to be very much inpressed by what they do not understand lady novelists especially are apt to imagine that they are realists as soon as they have 1 summoned up courage to disregardor i better still to invertthe oldfashioned rules of poetic justice but it is evident that something more is needed to complete the i portrait of a sinner than an assurance on i the last page of his impenitence and im  punitythough this may be true and plau x sible enough as far as it goes ouida however i never knows anything more of her heroes than  that they are very wicked very clever very t handsome and cause a great many flower c girls and others to drown themselves for t love of those superlative qualities but the f latter part of the process which the novelist  describes is not reckoned amongst the evii dence of the heros diabolical fascination  and craft because the sentiment of fatal awe a and admiration which attends his steps prei supposes a magic in his presence quite apart 3 from anything he can be made to do or say  on the stage in one way the present volume gains in veracity by its slightness be cause flamen a luxurious artist who wishes to paint a gretchen is not in evidence long enough to display qualities actively incompatible with the sentiment of which he is the shadowy object but then as his loyal worshipper b6beewho wears her little wooden shoes into holes by walking from brussels to paris when she hears he is illis something of a genius as well as a good and industrious little girl it is hardly fair to suppose her to be fascinated by a lay figure without any individuality at all the scenes descriptive of the quaint fancies and lonely businesslike life of the pretty young orphan amongst friendly villagers before flamen lends her paul and virginia are pleasantly drawn but as we advance the style becomes senti mental in the same vicious sense as the matter and meaningless refrains with a pathetic sound are used at intervals as a kind of warning that these are the places where it is desirable to feel as tearful as possible a good deal of sound virtuous indignation has been expended we cannot but think unnecessarily in denouncing the moral tendency of the fictions of this author and her school an admiring critic in the revue des deuv mlondes who gives ouida credit for a daring imagination rare in this country quotes her as silencing prudish objections by the assurance je n6cris pas pour les femmes jecris pour les militaires in which we should be tempted to see a piece of profound cynical selfcriticism if the slightest touch of humour in her works would allow us to suppose that she is herself not altogether imposed upon by the heroes who are probably admired by no living x men except perhaps very young officers in x regiments of higher social than literary i repute however this may be the little  wooden shoes will certainly not do any i harm to any one who does not make the x mistake of thinking the writing really fine i whilst anyone who is capable of making a such a mistake deliberately must have a 1 mind too impervious to literary influences i to be in much danger of suffering moral x deterioration from anything in print i mr robert turner cottons ideal of mas e culine perfection has much in common with e that of ouida but perhaps out of regard to i the degeneracy of the age he displays it less i crudely and as it were symbolically he s has a generation of young men who are t comparatively possible and prosaic but they  have a few surviving ancestors who in their r youth fought duels drank gambled and v made love on an heroic scale while towering r above the heads of even these distinguished f persons there appears the real hero mr a carington who arranged for them whom c they should shoot marry disinherit or d otherwise provide for while he was himself f4 too distinguished even to condescend to take r part in those aristocratic diversions which b he superintends in a grandly providential manner we are told that mr carington i when he could not find a good novel to read used to send to the circulating library for the silliest of the season and generally de lrived amusement from it perhaps mr cotton was not uninfluenced by this pecu liarity of his hero in writing what is more like a burlesque upon ordinary novels than a lserious attempt to achieve something more imaginative than even mr mortimer collinss tranemigration it is true that both these iworks are supposed to have really but one i author under different names the chief i reason being that in both all the characters have a habit of eating lobsters with enthusiasm at all hours of the day or night and that in both the poetical mottoes which abound are taken from the comedy of dreams which we gather to be an unpub lished trilogy in which things earthly and celestial do their best to look as if they were standing on their heads but have some difficulty in keeping in recognisable shape because they are released from obedience to the laws of gravitation as well as from the minor canons of probability we believe there are some people besides mr carington who do find novels amusing in which a great many things happen for no reason in particular and every one talks animatedly and with an air of deep con viction about nothing who prefer in fact a magic lantern to dissolving views and both to a panorama mr carington may be read without the sustained mental effort requisite to follow for instance a cunningly devised plot of mr wilkie collins and yet it con tains if possible more of marvel and mystery in the same space because none is wasted upon explanatory details or futile attempts to fill in the missing links of causation there is a russian prince who is so very wicked that nobody but mr carington can keep him in order and there is a russian secret society of which the late emperor napoleon iii was the headit is impossible to guess why as the final cause of the society seemed to be a desire to do something rather dreadful as soon as it could settle what to the russian prince the foreign office of course knows nothing about all these transactions till they are explained to a discreet subordinate by mr carington who we are given to under stand puts an extinguisher on the society by carrying off into cumberland and marrying to a friends son the italian lady who acts as the emperors second and aidedecamp it does not appear that the love and con spiracy  have any thing more to do with each other than is implied in the business of both being looked after at the same time by mr carington if we had to choose we should on the whole give the preference to the conspiracy half of the production for mr cottons ladies are nearly as bad as ouidas men though to do him justice he is content with traducing their manners and introduces no immorality to speak of that is less than fifty years old one young lady who we are told is a comical imitation of a stage chambermaid answers sufficiently well to the description but the real heroine elinor for whom the author professes unbounded reverence and admiration does not succeed in so demeaning herself as to make his boisterous assurances that she is the perfection of noble grace and gentle breeding appear as impertinent as such express statements would do if made concerning the absolute perfection of womanhood to say that the ideal lady is perfect shows a want of faith in the selfevidence of her perfections but to praise her in so many words for being ladylike is a positive insult or a confession of innate vulgarity for it is not more mar vellous for the ideal to be innocent of pert ness which by the way she is not than of pocketpicking the hero of transmigration has three lives one to each volume of which the first and third are spent on earth and the second in the planet mars the gere ral result of which seems to be that wherever lobsters and pert nymphs of erratic habits may be found man may enjoy moments of contentment but that for solid durable happiness it is necessary to be a schoolboy subject to flogging the book is not amusing because the author tries to play with his fancies before they are full grown and seems not to be quite sure but what if they were allowed to grow they might develop into a serious contribution to philosophy still the second volume is the least tiresome of the three though we cannot commend the modesty of this new dante who summons the great estese from the shades to act as his guide philosopher and friendly codevourer of lobsters the change of planet however seems to have moderated the length as well as the depth of the coleridgian harangues the chronicle of the ferniors is a chapter of domestic romance from the last century with the scenery carefully got up from contemporary memoirs and correspondence but the only justification for the second part of the title horace walpole itn love seems to be the assumption that horaces way of being in love would be to give no signs of the fact until the lady appeared to favour some other suitor in which case he would begin to satirise her mother there are no means of disproving the first part of the hypothesis but the second seems to prove too much for horace walpole can scarcely have been in love with the daughters of all the ladies of whom he has something spiteful to say in his correspondence the author scarcely succeeds in showing that he took more interest in lady sophia fermor than in any other famous beauty who was expected to marry one lord lord lincoln for love and was consoled for her dis appointment by the elderly but illustrious premier lord carteret there is an anachronism in some of the political wisdom which the duke of newcastle is supposed to bestow on his nephew lincoln who is to be consoled for the loss of sophia by the prospect of the government of ireland which has the advantage observes his grace of requiring neither skill nor knowledge it may be doubted whether the idea that skill or knowledge might be expected by a troublesome population from their rulers had so far taken shape in the ducal mind of the period as to be worth noticing even as a fallacy edith slmcox  two little wooden shoes two little wooden shoes a sketch by  onida author of  chandos under two flags c london  chapman and hall grotesqueness and vivid colouring the latter not always very carefully laid on are the prominent features of the later works of  ouida in the outset of her career and for some time afterwards she devoted herself to undisguised sensuality and the world was not a little startled in the nineteenth century to meet with a woman whose views of life were something more advanced than those of a pagan her language was not perhaps so objectionable as that of mrs aphra behn but her heroes and heroines were quite as impassioned the novelty to some extent wore off though the author cannot yet rid herself of that grossness which marked her former productions we know her theory of existence tolerably well by this time wines choice viands and animal passions are the gods of her idolatry the end of life is not to prove oneself worthy of it but to enjoy itnot utterly to destroy the intellect but to exercise it upon inferior objects and overlay all the solemnity of being with epicureanism and carnality the reflection is not a very pleasant one that books upon which such teaching is unmistakably stamped should attain wide popularity though we have as a setoff the confidence equally pronounced and unmistakable that this popularity can only be ephemeral time will ruthlessly sweep away into oblivion all the enticing trivialities of such writers as this in vain do we look through the numerous novels of  onida and their name is legion for some trace of an apprehension of the real dignity of man or woman save for the form in which it is enshrined humanity is bnt little superior to the beasts of the field like them man is to eat drink and enjoy and at the end of the farce their death is to be his likewise two little wooden shoes is in some respects an advance upon the previous stories of  ouida it is not so flushed with sensuous feeling nor is the expression so highflown but when we have diligently read it through we ask in amazement if this which has been put before us is all that the author has to offer touching the great realities of being she never gets beyond the rudimentary stage of existence her philosophy is sufficient only for children and dangerous for them and when the anal words of her story have been reached we find ourselves inquiring  what next   to tell a story well and with some degree of power is not all that is demanded of a novelist that were placing the art too low even through the garb of fiction man must receive something more than mere amusement but we suppose it is useless insisting upon this lesson as regards very many of our living novelists with a talent so inconsequent as  ouidas and one which is chiefly noticeable when describing the ecstasy of animal passion it is difficult to tell what to do we have the impression that but for these gleanings in forbidden fields her books would be miserable sustenance and therefore we are forced to the irresistible conclusion that it would have been better for her never to have written at all the owner of the  two little wooden shoes from which this story takes its name is one bebee a little peasant of brabant very poor and very bewitching when we first see her she has just completed her sixteenth year she dwelled in a little hut left to her by an old man who had adopted her illiterate to the last degree she is represented as never speaking without giving utterance to poetic thoughts and some of the sentences put into her mouth by the author we are constrained to say are really very beautiful bebee was in the habit of going to brussels to sell her flowers and was regularly to be seen under an awning fronting the maison du roi pursuing her avocations one day there came to her a strange customer in the form of a painter  he walked with an aey grace he was clad in picturelike velvets he had a beautiful poetic head and eyes like deep brown waters and a face like one of jordaens or rembrandts cavaliers this magnificent being was attracted by the beauty and artlessness of the peasant girl whilst she stood in awe of him the painter was called flamen but it was not his real name he had become famous in france at the age of twenty by painting a picture that brought paris to his feet he became still further famous by verses by plays by political follies and by social successes one year he wrote a witty political pamphlet that hurt where it was perilous to aim and he fled from the country a large portion of the story is occupied in detailing the gradual fascination which crept over bibles soul from her frequent interviews with the painter onida makes no scruple in telling us that he indulges the thought on several occasions of accomplishing her ruin but even his vicious soul is kept in check by her strong purity at length one morning he leaves her but promises to retain months pass on but he does not do so bebee hears that he is ill and travels on foot and in her little wooden shoes all the way from brussels to paris on arriving in that city she discovers his abode and rushing into his apartments to attend upon him in his sickness as she thinks she is appalled at the sight which meets her gaze we are not sure that we ought to quote  ouidas  description of this scene but a portion of it will serve to show that the author has not yet forgotten how to paint sensual pictures   she saw the dusky room as in a dream she saw him stretched on the bed leaning on his elbow laughing and playing cards upon the lace coverlet she saw women with loose shining hair and bare limbs and rubies and diamonds glimmering red and white she saw men lying about npon the couch throwing dice and drinking and laughing one with another beyond all she saw against the pillows of his bed a beautiful brown wickedlooking thing like some velvet snake who leaned over him as he threw down the painted cards upon the lace and who had cast about his throat her curved bare arm   with a great piercing cry she let the little roses fall and turned and fled at the sound he looked up and saw her and shook his beautiful brown harlot off him with an oath this passage does not occur in the mysteries of london but in a work published by a firm who have done immense service to literature and the novel is to be had by english ladies mothers and daughters  at all libraries though extract we must admit is one of a very rare kind in the book and we cannot help thinking that with whatever relish it may have been written by the author it has been inadvertently passed by the publishers the rest of the story is soon told bebee dies broken j hearted and the amorous painter keeps the little wooden shoes as a memento of one who loved him once this is i all the author has to say nothing high nothing lofty is  deduced the innocent and the beautiful dies and the j courttsane flourishes cleverly as it is written the novel is a fiasco as regards morals and is a step in the direction of the apotheosis of lasciviousness and vice thornton

chinese novels translated from the originals to which are added pro  verbs and moral maxiws collected from their classical books and other sources the ivhofc prefaced by observations on the language and lite j rature of china rfo by john francis davis frs 8vo pp 250 london 1822 until the embassy of lord macartney to china an imperfect translation of a novel was the only specimen of chinese literature for which we had to thank our countrymen and we were in the utmost ignorance respecting a people with whom our commercial dealings were immense that embassy howml  ever cleared away much of the obscu mi rity which involved the subject not merely through the personal observations of those who composed it but also by its more remote tendency to awaken a general curiosityandadesireto know something concerning so singular a people since that time chinese literature has received considerable attention the penal code of china has been translated other illustrations of chinese manners and chinese literature have been made known to us by the labours of sir george staunton and dr morrison and now mr davis by his translation of a few chinese novels and proverbs has enabled us to become still better acquainted with the subject these novels are prefaced by a brief but interesting notice of the language and literature of china  the chinese says mr davis value themselves not a little on the mere antiquity of their literature and are disposed to look down with great contempt on the learning of all other nations they have some books such as the yeking which are not now intelligible without a verbal comment to natives themselves if that may be applied to a nation which is told of an individual they may be compared to the man who wept in his old age because e could not comprehend the productions of his youth  but if we should be inclined lo laugh at them on this score they may still assume grounds of superiority over us ith as much right at least as he who proudly said to his audience  gentlemen i have forgotten more than you ever knew  a student of chinese should be somewhat acquainted with these books because there are frequent allusions to them in modern writings but to confine himself exclusively to them appears to be a downright loss of time there are many excellent works of a later date which may not only serve as better models of the style of the present day but likewise convey far more information with regard to the present state of the empire and the character of the people and as has been before observed multitudes of amusing dramas and novels from which may be selected much curious matter what we now want is a little practical know ledge of chinese literature instead of speculative dissertations on the nature ofthe language this volume contains three novels entitled  the shadow in the water c the twin sisters and the  three dedicated chambers they are all much too long for our insertion but we shall take the commencement of the second novel  the twin sisters which will afford a good specimen of the general style of these tales  early in the reign of an emperor of the ming dynasty there dwelt in a city of the province of hookwang a merchant named siaoukiang who had the misfortune to live on very indifferent terms with his wife they were for a long while without any family until after a lapse of many years two daughters twins were born to them it is a popular remark that sons generally resemble the father and daughters though motlier but these two sisters contrary to what is usum ally the case did not inherit the features of either of theil parents and they seemed like the children of some other family neither was the difference confined to their persons for their dispositions were quite as dissimilar as the father and mother wore extremely plain and very stupid so on the contrary the daughters were very handsome and particularly clever after ten years of age they began to resemble fair flowers glittering with dew or fragrant herbs agitated by the breeze  and their beauty every day increased until having reached the age of fourteen or fifteen no one could behold them without emotion not only were the young men in love with them but even those ofa more advanced age when they beheld  aaa confessed the power of their chara 4 their dispositions were extremely docile but notwithstanding this they lia i loamed but little and the xvhole extent of their knowledge xvas confined to figures as to though use of the needle and other female accomplishments they needed but little instruction in order to acquire them their dress and ornaments were from their station in life coarse and ordinary but vet when these txvo girls were compared xvith the daughters of more wealthy   their father beni a mcichautd and dignified persons it was allowed by all that they need not change their homely dress and metal ornaments for the silks and jewek of the others  as they were so very handsome and engaging it naturally followed that the young men of fortune and family should seek them  the good man and his dame were more like enemies than husband and wif the former wanted to marry his daughters without the interference ofthe latter and his wife on the other hand wished to obtain two scnsinlaw without the know ledge of her husband with this principle of mutual deceit they each of them secretly engaged with their sepaiate friends  though the father was severe in his own house he was naturally of a kind and friendly disposition  not like his wife whose turbulence led her when provoked to make the neighbourhood ring with her violence people therefore said to themselves that it would be an easier thing to dupe him than her aid that of the two it was better to aid the wife than the husband hence it was that the latter was more successful in her adherents than the former and after a little while for each of her daughters a husband was selected a fortunate day wtas chosen for the marriage and they the bridegrooms were desired to send the wedding presents  but with a view to prevent her husbands disapprobation and rejection of the match he was kept in ignorance of the whole  there were some sensible persons who said that the propriety of a daughters marriage ought to be determined by the father and that if the mother would not consent the matter should be referred to the magistrate who would neversule with an obstinate woman nor put add the husband for the sake of favouring the wife these persons wanted to get somebody to make their proposals to the former hut unfortunately all those whom they asked proved to be as ready to deceive him as they were afraid of his wife and when inmr  vited to act against her they immediately made some pretext for declining they dared not to incur her resentment saying that if they offended the husband they had nothing to do but tt wait irntd he broke out and then reason with him  and if he was violent they might still go and complain to the magistrate but if they offended his wife and her anger was excited it was not fit for them to contend with a woman  and should she abuse and even chastise them they must bear it and could do nothing in return  thus it was that no one would consent to assist those who wished to make proposals to the good man and they were accordingly obligt d to open the subject to him in person isle had been very much nettled at seeing people in the first inst ince go to his wife without coming t consult him and therefore on the present occasion when the marriage of his daughters was proposed to him he echoed ln consent vdth great satisfaction and made not the slightest obj dion  lio suitors told him that every one was afraid of his wife and tiiat for this reason none would act as mediators what therefore was to bo done isle replied  when the parties are unknoxvn to each other it is necessary to make use of snell agents  but when 1 have already given my consent what moro is required fi iie suitors hearing this were very glad and a lucky day xvas chosen on the spot for the transmission and reception ofthe marriage presents  the husbands plan was similar to his wifes inasmuch as ho would make no disclosure before bandi but let though natter to be developed bv hie occasion it happened that the hu kv day fixed upon by bth parties was the same and the gifts oi all the four bridegrooms arrived at the door together tin gongs made a great din and the different articles composing the presents were spread out promel so that there xvas no tching to what names they belonged  tiie tirst idea was that the bridegrooms knowing the bald understanding which existed between though parents ot tiie bride and fearful of offliding cither party hid each caused a pair of ceremonial tickets to be made out one for siaoukiang and the other for his wife thinking it better to be too ceremonious than not enough so when however the tickets xvere examined a little cloner it turned out to the great asionidiment of either party that no txvo names v ere the same but that ail four of thecaids had a different title the father and mother stared at one another and both broke out at once said one  in addition to nix two sonsiudaw

a free solitude by alice perrin chatto  wind us 2s 6d mrs perrins books are always good reading and are rendered unusual by the sincerity with which she follows a distinct purpose refusing to be swayed by hysterical conventions that demand a surfeit of sentimentality  a free solitude  is the second of the halfcrown novels to be published by messrs chatto and windus  and while it fully justifies their undertaking that these books shall be in all respects of the same standard as the sixshilling novels it outstrips this promise by its solid worth the action takes place at the foot of the himalayas and the main issue of the story is the struggle between the love of a woman and the love of the country that sometimes casts such a spell over the englishman a great portion of the story deals with a eurasian family as seen through the eyes of an english girl and the picture is of peculiar interest as it throws light on a class very little known to the average angloindian mrs perrin touches on a point which is apt to be overlooked by critics of the racial prejudices that complicate life in india eurasians are not  tabu  on account of their blood so much as on account of their class and when they are of a type which would not be welcome at a dinnertable in england it is unfair to expect the english to recognise them in india,northamerica_contra
trevlyn hold or squire trtvlyrcs heir new novels bythe author of  east lynne 3 vols tinsley brotherstrevlyn hold is more interesting and less melodramatio than most of mrs woods later works there is nothing startling about it not even a ghost she has succeeded in working out a good story full of action and plot without the aid of any very gross crime there is not a single murder worthy of the name not a robbery commonly so called not a forgery not a divorce case and only a very mild commonplace trial before a few county magistrates and yet strange to say in spite of this forbearance mrs woods new novel is more exciting than any she has produced since her first success in east lynne this is partly owing to her having refrained for once from imparting to her readers any lessons in teetotalism or political economy so that the story runs its course uninterruptedly and is full of interest from beginning to end another marked improvement in trevlyn hold is that there is more delicacy of touch in the delineation of the characters more light and shade than is usual with this author there aresome good points to be found even in members of the unpopular family and we are led to suppose that some of the persecuted race are liable to occasional failings of temper which render them infinitely more lifelike and true to nature than her heroes usually are mrs wood true to herself however is far from neglecting her favourite theory of retribution villany she believes brings its own reward even in this world innocence is sure to triumph sooner or later whether this is always the case in real life we do not feel so confident but in the world of fiction where the author has an unlimited power of bestowing rewards and punishments it would be hard if the wicked were to go scatbless and if the virtuous failed to obtain their rights at the end of the third volume the story of  squire trevlyns heir is as follows the old squire dies leaving one single daughter and two married daughters to succeed to his estates of his two sons one has run away in early youth and is supposed to have died abroad the other always a delicate invalid has died of consumption also abroad leaving a wife and an infant daughter but the squire never knows for it is fraudulently kept from him that joes widow has given birth to a posthumous son who should of course be heir to trevlyn hold the squire is a passionate vindictive old gentleman and tyrannical withal he is angry with his eldest daughter for having married tom ryle the gentleman farmer and he is angry with his son joe for having married the clergymans daughter and it is not difficult to persuade him to leave his property which is not entailed to the other married daughter mrs james chattaway and her children james chattaway has for years established himself at  the hold as confidential adviser and manager of the estates and by persuading or bribing the unmarried daughter to aid him in keeping the secret mr chattaway succeeds in concealing the birth of joes son and securing the inheritance for himself after his own sons rupert and joseph the squire accordingly bequeaths the hold to his second daughter mrs chattawaythus cutting off all hope for though children of his son joe and of his eldest daughter mrs ryle at the time the story opens james chattaway has been for born years in possession of trevlyn hold and his son cris lords it over his cousins bravely as the young squire should do mrs kyle is bitterly aggrieved that her son trevlyn kyle is deprived of his lawful rights and the neighbours generally regard the chattaways as usurpers and interlopers and feel convinced that rupert trevlyn poor joes orphan boy should be if all had their rights the master of trevlyn hold mr chattaway has received into his family joes children for their widowed mother is also dead and a pleasant life rupert and maud trevlyn have of it there mrs chattaway a weakminded helpless woraau does her best for them but she is as much afraid of her husband as they are and she can do but little to help them maud is made governess to the younger chattaways and rupert is honoured with the office of clerk at some mining works on the estate cris and octave chattaway taking good care meanwhile that they shall not be spoilt by any foolish overindulgence from softhearted mrs chattaway aunt diana tbe unmarried miss trevlyn who also resides at the holl is anxious that no gross injustice or cruelty should be perpetrated and so far as she is concerned administers justice to all her nephews and nieces with an even hand the hero of the tale is george ryle mrs ryles stepson a thoroughly upright conscientious young man who with the most unselfish motives manages trevlyn farm for his stepmother and halfbrother pays off all chittaways unjust claims upon them and is ready to retire in his brothers favour the moment he is required to do so of course george ryle falls in love with maud trevlyn and though persecuted with attentions from octave chattaway never swerves from his allegiance to the oppressed governess and equally of course is handsomely rewarded at last rupert trevlyn is however the bestdeveloped character in the book and in his wrongs and sufferings the interest chiefly centres worn out by a long train of daily insults from his uncle and cousins and stung to madness by a horsewhipping unjustly administered for some trifling offence rupert seizing a burning torch plunges it into a hayrick which stands temptingly close at hand and thereby ruins all his hopes of any mercy from the avaricious chattawaywe will not here relate the end of the story for it would forestall the pleasure of reading the book itself assurance may be given that though cruel chattaways are defeated in the most surprising and unexpected manner and that  the hold  becomes the property of its rightful owner all in good time there are some very welldepicted scenes scattered about the three volumes the accident at the mine and the burning of the ricky ard the death of farmer ryle and the advent of the mysterious stranger with the red umbrella are all excellent some of the characters too are original and well contrasted one with the other gentle mrs chattaway and her strongminded bisters airs ryle and diana trevlyn are good so are nora the bustling housekeeper at the farm and ann canham the weakeyed but worthy charwoman at the lodge take it all in all  trevlyn hold is a successful novel and will be more popular than many of its predecessors though perhaps it is not up to the

  a selfmade countess the justification of a husband by john strange winter white  co when a young lady of good family marries an earl she can scarcely be termed a selfmade countess the first title of this novel is therefore a misnomer the title of a book however matters little if the inside is satisfactory the work of fiction before us is amusing the first requirement in a novel in addition it is piquant and there are scattered about it some clever reflections which show that the author thoroughly recognises the prevalence of social humbug unfortunately she does not seem intimately acquainted with the world whose habits and mode of life she seeks to describe and has not only made ladies and gentlemen in good society snobbish in their ways of thought and motives but has caused them to use slang and common expressions to an extent which is certainly not general the fact is mrs stannard confounds smart with good society one might almost think that she wished in a book of feminine snobs to write a companion to thackerays masculine collection two prominent features in this work are a hatred and contempt for west kensington which is described as  the wild west and regarded with the utmost scorn  and a seeming determination to be as offensive as possible to americans the writer forgets that as there are english and english on the continent so there are americans and americans in england this wholesale abuse of the citizens of the united states is unjust unwise and in bad taste we do not expect absolute coherence and exactitude in a work of fiction but the author should not have written of the  governorgeneral of bombay whose hotweather residence is simla again the hero who is in the armya cavalry regiment of courseis married in the beginning of september and as a special piece of luck gets a very long leave as the regular leave season begins in october his luck is not very extraordinary,northamerica_contra

olive lathaon by e l voynich heine i mann wh1atsince we venture to class it with othersshould be said of books like  olive latham  they show perhaps many strong and even original points of detail but their refusal to emerge as organised wholes seems to throw them back into the limbo of the things that should be but somehow are not alive the things that will not stand on their feet so to speak this is we know not the received opinion concerning work by this author her jack raymond however and the gadfly do not alter the conviction we have rightly or wrongly formed this novel bears on the horrible old story of russias misgovernment official criminality and particularly on the chartered suppression of the genius and even the lives of her children the question seems not so much if the picture be true or unnecessarily unpleasant but if the author has put new life and significance into the scenes where her revolutionaries and their persecutors figure knowledge of the movements towards a freer intellectual and political life there is but this presentation of it in the concrete is crude even perhaps a little brutal and not to the present reviewer truly powerful and soulstirring readers of olive latham may indeed supand that plentifullyon horrors butand here is the weaknesswithout being intensely horrified or moved to deepest pity and indignation nothing in the way of situation or circumstance that should affect readers to such emotions has been left out even restraint and the effect by suggestion rather than description are not to her unknown methods but the unfortunate fact is that in spite of its grim subject and the grimmer revelations it produces this book has an air of being manufactured rather than inevitable surely the begin ning and the end of it speak for themselves one isolated phase must be called in itself if not in the context almost masterly that is the analysis and presentment of the heroines mental condition when after her prolonged vigil over her russian lover she returns to quiet english scenes haunted by her idee8 fixe8 there she hovers long on the borderland between sanity and insanity in a painful indifference to the realities that surround her the pathological aspect of the case shows the author at her bestat least it suits her best  olive latham alike for its vivid and realistic pictures of life in modern russia and for its brilliant studies of such widely differing characters as those of olive herself and of her two lovers the nihilist idealists vladimir damarov and ldr karol slavinski mrs novnichs latest novel is a very remarkable oo0k olives father alfred latham was the eldest son of a country banker and had carried with him from cambridge the reputation of a person likely to make his mark in the world the one real passion of his heart was education for the masses his dreams were of public libraries and free universities of technical and physical training for all of evening lectures and model primary schools as the eldest son he had been expected to become his fathers partner but he announced that he wished to be a schoolmaster and accepted a raggedschool post in the slum district of a northern factory town  presently however his marriage accomplished what the disjuasions of his friends had failed to do his wife could not understand or sympathise with his aims she admired and worshipped him and was too sweettempered to complain but soon found herself timidly wishing that alfreds philanthropy could take a more usual and less disagreeable form he is fretted by the knowledge that he is thus making her unhappy and her health breaking down for her sake he gives it all up and succeeds to his father in the huine of the bank so it is with a sense of peculiar satisfaction not unmixed with fears for her and regrets for the career he hald abandoned that lhe sees his dead passion for spending himself in the service of humanity reviving in olive the girl had shown from

sir brook fossbrooke sir brook fossbrooke by charles lever 3 vols 8vo pp 971 24s blackwoods the wrath of achilles compelled him to resignthat of sir william lendrick constrained him to fight to the last such is the real key to this very clever novel it is perhaps the most finished of mr levers as to plot the nominal hero is one f his stock charactersa man of the world who has been everywhere seen and done everything always losing everything and always tumbling on his feet again in some extraordinary manner we cannot take much interest in him he resembles a civilised hawkeye if hewas new he would be very good but we have seen his double too often before however he fills up space uncommonly well and his adventures give opportunity for some capital descriptions and little bits of worldiyadvicejwhich come from no one better than the author of  harry lorrequer a party intrigue to get an octogenarian judge to resign would not seem a very promising basis for a novel which was to appear by instalments in a popular magazine yet few could pass a scene with baron lendrick and not wish to know whether he was ultimately triumphant over courts cabals and an unscrupulous press true there is much to be said for his enemies his incredible vanity tempted attack but the sharpness of his tongueand we not only read about bis wit bnt can enjoy itooa pat down the assailants the reality of his danger makes the contest perilous enough to interest whilst the extreme inferiority of the dogs which would beard the sick lion enlist all sympathy on one side only his generosity prevents his eating them up and though we see their footprints as they come out it is evident they have been sorely mauled varied attainments will always excite more varied if not more powerful envy and as the chief baron is alwaysin his old age at leastacute enough to appear only on his own grounds he could only be reached through the newspapers once indeed the lordlieutenant tried to see what he could do himself he fared as agamemnon would have done in the tent of achilles the host asserted every privilege and he told the story to his son who he used to say had inherited his temper but not his abilities in these words he twice rose to go away but on each occasion i had something to say that induced him to sit down again it was the whole case of ireland we reviewedthat is did i deployed the six millions before him and he took the salute yes sir education religious animosities landtenure drainage emigration secret societies the rebel priest and the intolerant parson even nationality and mendicant insolence all marched past and he took the salute   and now my lord said i  it is the man who tells you these things who has the courage to tell and the ability to display them and it is this man for whose retirement your excellency is so eager that you have actually deigned to make him a visit that he may carry away into the next world perhaps a pleasing memory of this it is this man i say whom you propose to replaceand by what my lord and by whom  will a mere lawyer will any amount of nisi prius craft or precedent give you the qualities you need on that bench or that you need sadly need at this councilboard  go back my lord and tell your colleagues of the cabinet that providence is more merciful than a premier and that the same overruling hand that has sustained me through this trial will uphold me i trust for years to serve my country and save it for some time longer from your blundering legislation that a man of such conceit as this at last falls a prey to some one who knows how to fool him to the top of his bent is a matter of course but there are many excuses for the blindness of sir william the villain of the tale is his own stepson separated from his wife and at issue with his son the old judge must fabricate for himself some kind of domestic lares his good dinners and what all who hear them for the first time admit them to be his good stories will provide him with listeners and flatterers for his evenings but he wants a majordomoa man who will make out his dinnerlist and see that his champagne is iced who can receive sir brook fossbrookes and doctor his horses in fact a primeminister whose head nevertheless is in every sense alwajs at his disposal but dudley sewell the man of forged acceptances and questionable racingbets is not to be governed altogether by even an irish chief baron and a possible peer it is a rich treat to see how he not only carves the judicial meat but rearranges the judicial wardrobe sir william is transformed into a  dandy of fifty who bows with a grace this deception does not last long but it is necessary in an artistic point of view the old man deserves a fall and even his best friends are glad to find he is not infallible meanwhile sir brook who ought to have been his most trusted friend is far away making his fourth or fifth fortune and of course spending it in daydreams before he has got it he comes back in triumph to find sir william as great as ever still demanding his peerage as the price of resignation but sobered by the recollection that he has at last given some ground for the accusation of senility at last he extorts the offerbut from the enemy he outlives the government which denies him justice and is too magnanimous to lend himself to the intrigues of their successors perhaps the incapacity of his heir may have something to do with his refusal and affection tempers pleasantly enough the last exhibition of intellectual conceit mr lever is rather too fond of letting ns know exactly what his characters like for their meals it is not that they are gluttons but we dont go to books of this class for a dietary though we might easily compile one from them the dialogue is sparkling the perpetual flavour of irishisms is not overdone and much as mr lever has written we doubt if he has ever told a less affected or a more wellwrought tale wo dont like the book the less because it appears without any grotesque illustrations like so many of the novels which are published by messrs blackwood and sons it is got up beautifully and will take a handsome place in any library long after thc first gloss is worn off by the thorough perusal its merits will ensure  sir brook fossbrookke there was a controversy some years ago between two wellknown periodicals upon the subject of lord lyttons novels one declaring its preference for his earlier the other for his later works however this may be there can be no doubt that mr levers productions are susceptible of a similar dispute for whilst they are all more or less based upon a similar plan of fiction their diction their colouring their construction have undergone from the first a gradual but marked modification this even to a careless observer was sufficiently apparent in  tony butler and in the story now before us it will be found confirmed  sir brook fossbrooke  we conceive to be one of the best of mr levers productions we cannot characterise it better than by the word clever it is essentially a clever novel moreover it exactly conforms to the true idea of the romance it supplies us with the precise entertainment that is expected to be found in fiction it is interesting and it is amusing excitement is offered without the violation of probability and it is eloquent without labour or artifice it is wholly destitute of those narratives of practical jokes and that eagerness to excite merriment which so retard the action of his earlier novels though the scene of the story is almost wholly laid in ireland the author has ver sensibly omitted all the hackneyed expletives of the conventional hibernian interlocutor there is only one  faix  in the book and what little irish there is

come sir brook fossbrooke and young trafford a subaltern in hms th casually meeting tom lendrick they are invited to his fathers house the swans nest and there he introduces them to his sister lucy the description given of sir brook fossbroope is excellent an old man who has combatted life in a multitude of shapes whose early years have been devoted to dissipation and who in his riper age yields himself up to abstract contemplations and scientific inquiries sir brook no sooner casts his eye upon lucy than he feels himself insensibly attracted towards her a resemblance to some cherished object in the past awakens in him a paternal affection and it may be said that from that moment he becomes the firm and faithful friend of the two young people nor is the impression made by lucy upon trafford less acute though with him it assumes a nature more romantic prior to his visit dr lendrick makes a journey to dublin to see his father who has been suddenly seized with a severe indispositiona fact that leads his warmhearted medical attendant dr beattie to believe a favourable moment has arrived to reconcile the father and son we are then introduced to sir william lendrick

sport who instead of going to bohemia the rocky mountain and to africa would find all their savagery near home and pay us splendidly for the privilege there are some difficulties in the plan it is true our beasts might not be easy to keep within bounds the jaguar might make an excursion into the marketplace the bear might eat a butcher sir brook besides doubts if ferne could be preserved under

have the whole details of this on pap even to the cost of the beasts and the pensions to the widows of the keepers that may be devoured another plan that we had and it looked plausible enough too was

night and for ever muttering in her ear with white lips and trembling whisper words of cruel import yet whatever sympathy for her position her sex may compel from us we cannot help the edge being blunted by the despicable character that is disguised beneath an immaculate exterior  nor can we easily deny that all that she gets she very richly deserves however much we may detest the unmanly heart that dictates the chastisement this lady comes to the priory where she strikes up an intimacy with lucy lendrick who however does not entirely reciprocate her apparently friendly attention old sir william lendrick contemplates her with much satisfactionas much for her beauty as for the ease and gaiety of her manners subsequently the colonel ingratiates himself in the household and by much show of humility and assumption of profound respect for the judges wisdom succeeds in rendering himself endurable nevertheless the old man from certain motives fully disclosed before long significantly hints the departure of the gallant colonel and on the strength of this his mother lady lendrick rents the  swans nest  for him where in company with his wife and children he proceeds to ensconce himself he collects round him here through the medium of dinnerparties and brandy and water a number of officers whom he endeavours to swindle but to one of whom he is unfortunate enough to lose a thousand pounds this occurrence is described with great power and the unexpected presence of his wife who watches the players from the back of her husbands chair renders the whole scene singularly effective it is not our intention to enter into any further analysis of the plot believing that we have already said enough to disclose to the reader the nature of the volumes that await his perusal it is of a somewhat complex nature though uniform and consistent indeed strength is the chief characteristic of the story the interest is unflagging the incidents with which the narrative is enlivened being disposed with the nicest discrimiia ion one error however though on the right side which will be sufficiently obvious to an attentive reader we cannot pass over without comment the dialogues are almost all too brilliant from the epigrammatic point and polish with which they are contrived we miss the flow and ease of spontaneous conversation in such men as sir brook fossbrooke and the chief baron this might be thought reasonable but to make girls or men of mediocre intellect converse with the precision and point of matured elocutionists is to violate nature the dialogues in fact seem too laboured the declamation of each speaker is too sententious the conversation seems dictated by the author of  rasselas and however admirable it may be as containing specimens of a just bty le or as a record of profound observation it could have been wished for the sake of accuracy that the language of the women bad something more of sprightliness and ease and of the men something less of artificial point as a fault apart from the artistic quality of the book may be mentioned a grievous solecism in taste which we regret mr lever should have fallen into baron lendrick is a portrait so thinly disguised that every irishman will recognise it at once while a doctor in the novel is positively identified by name this is not a legitimate course for a novelist anid mr lever is

  the sport of the gods by esther miller i innes  co where a man is liable to be indicted for murder and where the only witness who can condemn him or save him by silence is a woman one of two things can happen she can be called as a witness to give her evidence or if there is no disability or impediment she can marry the accused in a criminal case a wifes testimony is not admissible against her husband on this question turns the story entitled  the sport of the gods it is long before the heroine knows that her husband is innocent and until then they live apart at length it is found that there was another and a better witness and the real murderer is revealed such is the story and as a melodramatic plot it is very well told the reader will regret that the literary skill of the author which is small is not equal to her capacity for framing a plot nevertheless the novel is exciting and preserves its interest to the end we imagine that a lawyer who reads the first few chapters will ask why the leading personages including a practising solicitor are not indicted for conspiracy by statute as well as at common law but such an occurrence would unquestionably spoil an otherwise excellent story,northamerica_contra

the history of sir richard calmady a romance literature f new novels  by lucas malet methuen co what sort of novel shall we have next the political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one all they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length what we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues the history of sir richard calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough mrs harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the surrey hills the family legend and the family curse six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a meredithian turn but the atmosphere is alas more clinical than meredithian the skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely the history of sir richard calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed the leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable fallowfield are all the more welcome his son ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three

  new novels the rose of life by m e braddon hutchinson  co the mighty influence of the zeitgeist is plainly discernible in this latest work of the veteran novelist thirty years ago it would have seemed unlikely that miss braddon would ever write a novel depending for interest less on plot than characterization yet such is the enterprise which she has here not unsuccessfully achieved the popular poet with his attractive egotism his ready though chiefly vicarious philanthropy and his genuine superiority to snobbishness and all its works is well conceived and so harmoniously developed that when he is detected in the act of swindling one of his best friends the disclosure though dramatically unexpected does not strike us as inconsistent with what we already know of him his simpleminded devoted wife is also good in her way and has the merit rare in that particular type of woman of conciliating sympathy rather than rousing irritation the villains male and female the heroine and the titular hero are none of them of much account and the device of the bigamous marriage scarcely appeals to us as it did in the days when it was a comparatively new thing in fiction,northamerica_contra

the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed 6s john long smrs campbell praed is one of the most readable of the novelists of australian life to begin with she is more intelligible there is less slang in her books than is usual in australian novels so far as we remember no one in  the maid of tne river  cooks or boils a  bill whatever that mysterious article mav be in fact the only really unintelligible word which occurs in the book is humpy wvhat a  humps  is we have not the remotest idea but the rest of the book vould be intelligible to the rawest  new chum yet the whole atmosphere of the story is distinctively australian it is the work of one intimately acquainted with the country the local colour is real it is part of the book and not simply daubed on after a few months cursory studv the pljt is elementary it is the familiar story of the confiding girl and the fascinatin seducer and it suffers from the usual wieakness that ihe seducer is not sufficientiv seductive nuni destiac is a pathetic figure but her innocence is almost inconceivabbly childish and stewart the villain of the piece is such a heartless and repellent blackguard that we fail to understand nulnis preference for him lnfatuation of this kind is only explicable where there is real passion and mrs iraed is too far lacking il passion to make her heroines conduct convincing  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed john long this is another of the prolific authors australian tales and one of the best she has produced it has none of the improbability of her  fugitive anne and is more carefully and sincerely written than her last english story indeed it is a genuine and very painstaking piece of work the realism of which will at once be admitted by all who know anything of australian life we are chiefly concerned here not with the hazards and simple pleasures of the bush life which mrs campbell praed has often portrayed in the past but with the life of a young girl who after a childhood spent in pleasant circumstances upon her fathers station up country is taken to live in the colonys capital as the immediate result of the banks foreclosure upon her fathers station the father obtains an inferior government clerkship in the capital and thus our heroine after a youth spent amongst all the generous freedom of a squatters homestead is introduced to the somewhat squalid realities of life on an inadequate income in the poor quarter of a colonial city the authors picture of this phase of australian life u especially deserving of commendation life as she here depicts it is actually being lived in singlestoried weatherboard villas in all the poorer suburbs of melbourne and sydney it is a less squalid life perhaps than that led by equally needy people in england because it is somewhat less cramped and confined but it is squalid petty and unlovely the heroine is a commonplace character enough though not unpleasing while she is little more than a child her vanity and simplicity combined with her unusual prettiness mark her out as a victim of the unoriginal wiles of a handsome blackguard who boasts that he has royal blood in his veins the girls downfall is a stereotyped piece of fiction but as a young mother she adopts a course which is certainly unusual among heroines and successfully sues her betrayer for breach of promise all this is rather deftly managed and without serious disregard of the probabilities we are enabled to reach the sort of denouement which the majority of novelreaders have long ago pronounced to be the most fitting  the maid of the river by mrs campbell praed long 6s mks campbell praed clearly gave her imagination a rest when planning her latest story and was content to follow a wellworn track which runs through some rather dreary country here is once more a beautiful innocent girl who rejects an honest mans love and yields to the florid attractions of handsome swaggering alexander stewart betrayed by a mock marriage she meets with the usual experience of scandal and desertion when for her childs sake she demands recognition as a wife the author does not hesitate to provide stewart with a legal wife shut up in a lunatic asylum nuni destiac is dismayed and the reader is sorry for other than sympathetic reasons the only variation upon the old theme is that at mrs stewarts death nuni brings an action for breach of promise the sort of revenge hardly consistent with her character and a departure from the tradition she had closely followed hitherto her numerous predecessors in misfortune were equally ready to die of a broken heart or to marry the patient lover in the background  they would have scorned to appeal to a jury there 13 vigour and individuality in several of the characters and the story is well told but as a whole it falls far below mrs praeds best work the bitterness and hopelessness that become part of the life of the struggling official class in leichardts town are almost too faithfully reflected in these pages it is not the first time that mrs campbell praeds australian stories have made us realise that all the gold of the diggings would not compensate us for living in leichardts townas she depicts it,northamerica_contra
the ms in a red box lane the author of this romance has had the good fortune to hit upon a period in history which has not been hackneyed by general use we remember no other novel in which the draining of the fens by dutchmen under charles i is the mainspring of the plot it is well known that this improvement roused the fierce hostility of the people of the fens and it is that hostility which the author employs in his stirring narrative thus the tale has this to the good that it has a natural colour particular to it and is in consequence of somewhat a different shape from the multitude of romances technically termed  historical unhappily the characterization has little to distinguish it from the ruck of such performances the hero frank vavasour is the usual brave and reckless young fellow in love with a fair maiden as is habitual with such tales the hero is so headstrong as to run into every danger that a man with a grain of common sense would have avoided as is also usual he tells his own tale very modestly of course and sings the praises of his ladylove not so modestlyas is natural and the two chief villains are exactly what we looked forthe one dutch and the other an english nobleman they are blackened to a hair and could not be whitewashed by the most ingenious perverter of history but of a truth they glory in their shame and are calculated to fill unsophisticated minds with the most passionate feelings of revenge for the colours are all primitive and the drawing is with crayons not that that matters in this style of book it is sufficient that there should be plenty of incident which there is and that the narrative should amble briskly which it does the writing too is of quite a spirited order so that there is little wanting to make a good book of adventure rather above the average and possibly the earnest of better work by its anonymous author  the ms in a red box lane 6s tue mystery of the ms of this story has been so much exploited that we need not refer to it further here save to pay that the book itself comes rather as an anticlimax for though it is a pleasant and reasonably interesting book it is no better than dozens of volumes which have appeared during say the past three years the author has a faculty for narrative sufficient invention and enough knowledge of his period to carry the thing through  in a word he is a good mechanic but there is no characterisation in the story the hero is the very type of the conventional hero and the three villains are very types of the conventional villain the hero sails triumphantly through all dangers to happiness and the lady and the villains come by their deserts there are a good many minor characters but they come in merely as accessories indeed the experienced reader can tell at once just why they make their appearance but all this is not to say that the book is not goed of its kind the setting is careful and accurate and the conflict between the folks of axholme and the dutch engineer vermuijden who had charles the firsts authority to drain and embank the isle is vigorously described the manner of the book smacks rather of wardour street purely modern phrasing and almost slang clash unpleasantly with an artificial archaism but here again the author merely sins with most of those secondclass writers of romance with whom at present he must be classed yet the story has promise and a kind of ease and briskness which experience may turn to good account and at least the book is wholesome and manly and cleanblooded  the ms in a red box 6s lane mysterious and ingenious rumours and advertisements had raised our expectations to such a height that  the nis in a red box must hai e been a very e xt raord r in a ry book inceed if it had come ip to them it is not a lery extraordinary book but it is distinctly good and if it had not been so overshadowed by its antenatal reputation it would have seemed even better it is a brisk capable romance of the accepted latterday patterr laid in the lincolinsiire fen country in the reign of charles i  it has the usual fearless but somewhat slowwitted hero who plunges into a fresh peril every time lie

villain whose schemes to kidnap her invariably fail at the right moment the usual crop of glaring coincidences and the usual happy end but some of the minor characters are excel lently drawn the

  dreamers of the ghetto by i zangwill heinemann mk zangwill is always at his best when he reveals the jews by his patient and sympathetic insight into their ways and by his fearless exposures not only of their greatness but of the more offensive sides of judaism he makes judaismthe judaism which seems to be slowly dying out as the narrow exclusive sect it was intelligible in all its majestic immovability in all its squalid and odious intolerance perhaps no one has ever rendered it so intelligible before sympathetic writers have insisted on the stubbornness of purpose the race and family pride the glorious selfsacrifice for what they hold true which have characterised the jews and their faults have found censorious critics but no one has like mr zangwill fearlessly shown the pathos and the greatness of their squalor and their bigotry and found the secret of their strength even in what renders them most unpopular in christendom ceremony as one of mr zangwills characters here says has been the chief element of their strength another less obvious one which he picks out is the enforced seclusion of the ghetto system which has really only been thoroughly broken down in the present century the bad laws which fastened on them distinctive badges and herded them together in narrow quarters where they saw none but their own coreligionists the insults and persecutions which seemed only to draw them tighter together have all added the strength of martyrdom to their bonds of connexion the removal of these restrictions has already done something to impair the vital unity of the race but not much yet and it remains to be seen if the scepticism and desertions of judaism which are more noticeable now are really anything more than superficial scratches on the system a point which mr zangwill does not notice but which stands out most prominently in his book is the parasitical nature of judaism in the sketch called chad gadya a young venetian jew comes back to venice and makes reflections on the stability of judaism when all the energy and the glory of life which once made venice the great state of the south have departed and he muses on the seeming eternity of judaism when he finds his father living in the palace of some once proud doge or senator that is of course true but he forgets the other point of view that while the proud old venetians gave up all their energy and their wealth to the glorifying of their state the jews a race apart have cared for no country hve made no country great they have flocked where riches were to be found and they have steadily silently selfishly gone on making their private wealth anally to enjoy the half  faded glories in which they had no part the persecutions of the jews are inexcusable but they are explicable from the feeling that all nations have had that they are a race apart who have not the stake in the country which comes from selfsacrifice for it this book is almost entirely concerned with the rebels against ceremony in the jewish foldjews who have been dreamers and have found their souls frozen with the mean ingless jargon and the empty forms which were supposed to make up so much of their livesmen who have tried to burst the bonds but in nearly every case have found themselves either driven back or striving to return to the religion which has guarded them through so many centuries mr zangwill deals with very varied typeswith gay laughterloving heine with the profound philosopher spinoza with the meteor ferdinand lassalle with moses mendelssohn and with sabbatai zevi a messiah who finally turned mohammedan and doorkeeper to the sultan these sketches are not novels they are hardly stories they are as a rule imaginary conversations or isolated incidents in the lives of different people in which their characters stand out translucently a reviewer of mr zangwill said once that he had no human sympathy that his characters do not live there is perhaps a grain of truth in the remark but what would be truer would be to say that all his human sympathy seems merged in judaism as a system he loves it so intensely that though he sees its faults and shows them up he looks on them more as a parent looks on the faults of a favourite child than as a stern critic as he himself justly says in his preface the book is to be looked on as a whole the subject being the old orthodox judaism which all these dreamers play around like flies on a lion as for the sketches themselves the best undoubtedly is that of lassalle the author brings out in a masterly way the stupendous conceit the oriental exuberance of fancy and the marvellous rapidity of execution of this wonderful jew he reminds us much of the glorious and extravagant heroes of disraelis novels or again of harry richmonds father in mr merediths novel heine is good but mr zangwill has fallen into the error which it is difficult to avoid in writing an imaginary conversation of such a wellknown figure he brings in too many allusions to heines own works and employs too many quotations from heine himself consequently the result seems almost too learned to be convincing however it is charming perhaps because there is so much in it of heine himself,northamerica_contra

at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the

the fortunes of glencore by charles lever 3 vols chapman  hall between this novel and its predecessors from the same pen there is a difference as wide as that between a feudal tournament and a tipperary row formerly mr lever was a lord of romantic misrule his harry lorrequer was the kinsman of his irish dragoon and both were the heroes of fun folly and adventure the lever literature in truth was sprightly and rollickingthe action ofthe several stories rattled on amid uproar and excitementthe actors and the audience laughed together there was a brogue even in the style of the narrator the fortunes of glencore is of another stamp it is a serious novel built upon a plan more conventional than that adopted by mr lever in any of his former works from a prefatory notice we quote the authors account of his literary temptations  if i have never disguised from myself the grounds of any humble success i have attained to as a writer of fictionif i have always had before me the fact that to movement and action the stir of incident and a certain lightheartedness and gaiety of temperament more easy to impart to others than to repress in oneself i have owed much if not all of whatever popularity i have enjoyed i have yet felt or fancied that i felt that it would be in the delineation of very different scenes and the portraiture of very different emotions that i should reap what i would reckon as a real success this conviction or impression if you will has become stronger with years and with the knowledge of life  years have imparted and time has but confirmed me in the notion that any skill i possess lies in the detection of character and the unravelment of that tangled skein which makes up human motives he presents glencore not as a proof but as a test of his capacity for drawing social portraits his story he admits may not be particularly interesting as a narrative but it is an attempt at close delineation of character manners and modes of thought as influenced by the civilization of our age in great britain and in italy for although glencore is the name of an irish castle and many of the personages introduced are english a large proportion of the ground surveyed is italian while much of the groupsketching belongs to the danimonde of florence glencore is the name of an ancient castle on the killeries an inlet of the sea in the west of ireland it appertains to a noble family of whom the sixth viscount is the central figure of the story although his son divides the sympathies of the reader when the tale opens lord glencore after a prolonged absence has returned to his ancestral habitation whereisolated penurious and melancholyhe devotes himself to the education of his only son in course of time two old and confidential friends arrive at the castle they find its inmate alternating between delirious fever and a habit of morbid soliloquy the boy is scarcely less eccentric than his lather gradually the secret glimmers out from the reserve and mystery of glencore the viscount all novel readers will have suspected ithas been deserted by his wife mr lever however has managed to develop a novelty in  connexion with this incident glencore unfolds to his confidential associate sir horace upton a plan of revenge upon the lost and faithless lady sir horace alone could offer testimony to the marriage  all the documents are at glencore castlethe viscount destroys these documents sacrifices his son and proclaims that clarissa isabella daughter of sir guy clifford and commonly called lady glencore was never married but is still clarissa isabella clifford ami mother not of a seventh viscount but of a social outcast this shaft of vengeance launched from the killeries reaches florence where the separated wife  la comtesse de glencore reigns queen of beauty and fashion thus stigmatized she disappears glcncores son disappears also the story then winds through numerous intricacies to the end which in fairness tu mr lever we will only vaguely indicate in the last chapter billy traynor the most original character in the novel meditates alone at the ancient castle  the battlements have fallenthe atlantic winds blow noisily through the fractured walls the old man reads the family chronicles  he started up from his reverie and taking his stick issued from the room the mist was beginning to rise and he took his way towards the shore of the lough through the wet and tangled grass it was a long and toilsome walk for one so old as he was hut he went manfully onward and at last reached the little jetty where the boats from the mainland were wont to put in all was cheerless and leadenhued over the wide waste of water a surging swell swept heavily along but not a wiil was to be seen far across the lough he could descry the harbour of leenane where the boats were at anchor and see the lazy smoke as it slowly rose in the thick atmosphere seated on a stone at the waters edge billy watched long ami patiently his eyes turning at times towards the bleak mountain road which for miles was risible at last with a weary sigh he arose and muttering he wont come today turned back again to his lonely home to this hour he lives and waits the coming of glencore racterpainting as mr lever explains in the preface has been his aim throughout these volumes we think his success special though partial billy traynor in spite of occasional exaggerations is a lifelike figure with a lifelike voice the elder glencore typifies in his diseased hate and weary weakness the fortunes of his declining family his son is but a shadow and melts out of view  sir horace upton is a political portrait the original of which perhaps might be discovered without trouble of course mr lever had the princess lieven in his eye when he studied for his lady diplomatist col harcourt full length hangs at the light end of the gallery glencore occupies the gloom there is careful drawing in all these portraits sometimes the features are unreasonably prominent frequently the tintings are those of the toilettetable not of nature mr lever we think is rough in his use of the dissectingknife to the machinery of the story objections more serious may be taken it fe worked partly by means of correspondence occasionally by newspaper paragraphs and in one instance by a leading article there is too much stilllife  though reader continually regrets being led away from the healthy irish landscapes and peasant circles around glencore following the fortunes of the miserable viscount we arrive at a passage which is a fair sample of mr levers dialogue and romance new style and how is the dear duke asked upton sharplyjust as you saw him at the court of louis the eighteenth he swaggers a little more as he gets more feeble about the legs and he shows his teeth when he laughs more decidedly since his last journey to paris devilish clever fellows these modern dentists are he wants to marry i suppose youve heard it not a word of it who is the happy fairthe nina as they call her now she waa one of the della torres who married or didnt marry glencore dont you remember him he was colonel of the eleventh and a devil of a martinet he was i rememler him said upton dryly well he ran off with one of those girls and some say they were married at capri as if it signified what happened ut capri she was a deuced goodlooking girl at the time  a coquette you knowand gleucore was one of those stiff english fellows that think every man is making up to his wife he drank besides no pardon me there you are mistaken i knew him intimately glencore wat as temperate as myself i have it from lowther who used to take him home at night he said glencore never went to bed sober at all events she hated him and detested his miserly habitoanother mistake my dear major glencore was never what is called a rich man but he was always a generous one i suppose youll not deny that he used to thrash her  ay and with a horsewhip too come come scaresby this is really too coarse for mere jestingjest by jove  it was very bitter earnest she told brignolles all about it im not sure she didnt show him the markstake my word for it scaresby said upton dropping his voice to a low but measured tone  this is a base calumny and the duke of brignoues no moro circulated such a story than i did he is a man of honour and utterly incapable of it i can only repeat that i believe it to be perfectly true  said scaresby calmly  nobody here ever doubted the story i cannot say what measure of charity accompanies your zeal for truth in this amiable society scaresby but i can repeat my assertion that thia must be a falsehood  you will find it very hard nevertheless to bring any one over to your opinion retorted the unappeasable major he was a fellow everybody hated proud and supercilious to all and treated his wifes relationswho were of far better blood than himselfas though they were canaille i a loud crash as if of something heavy having fallen here interrupted their colloquy and upton sprang from his seat and hastened into the adjoining room close beside the doorso close that he almost fell over it in entering  lay the figure of lord glencore in his efforts to reach the door he had fainted and there he laya cold clammy sweat covering his livid features and his bloodless bps slightly parted the fortunes of glencore we suspect is mr levers favourite among his own works it is we think clever amusing spiced with telling satire written throughout vigorously and keenly but if we had to decide on though authors claims to a permanent and peculiar reputation we should not accept this book as his highest testimonial he must not omit frorahis titlepage author ofcharles omalley and  harry lorrequer,northamerica_contra

fiction a tale of the mutiny on the face of the waters by flora annie steel william heinemann mrs steels new story has been sj highly praised already vide press notices passim as quoted in the advertisements that if it were merely for the sake of a change one would be inclined to draw attention to its weaknesses there is a danger we hope it is no more that a somewhat uncritical admiration for the work of the clever lady who has now come to be spoken of as the female rudyard kipling  may do harm both to the authoress and her public the description is neither elegant nor correct for mrs steels resemblance to mr kipling begins and ends in the fact that both write about india from intimate personal knowledge and that the resemblance should strike both critics and public so forcibly is a remarkable sign of the novelty with which this inside handling of indian subjects came upon the masses in whose name our great dependency is ruled is it too much to express a fear that mrs steel has been tempted by thi reception to imagine that she has a mission to inform the british public about the true history of india  in her latest book at any rate the element of history seems to us entirely to overbalance the fiction we hasten to say that so far as the facts are concerned they are admirably portrayed mrs steels capacity as a historian of the indian mutiny is undeniable she is soaked through and through with knowledge of the environment in which she sets her story she is no partisan and her heroworship is combined with justice but after all fiction is fiction it is with some apprehension that the present writer who was one of the first to call attention to the power and beauty of those short sketches of mrs steels which came out anonymously in macmillans sees the authoress compelled to begin her new story with a preface insisting on its historical accuracy and explaining that it intended to be history as well as  story in her own criticism that in such an attempt she will probably fail in either aim mrs steel seems to us to be a better oritic of herself than most authors are it is not from a novelist that we want  every incident scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather it is not for the writer of fiction to boast that i have not allowed the actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings let the local colour be correct by all means but wc make a fetish of realism if such restrictions are put upon what in its essentials is an imaginative art the account of though sham court at delhi says mrs steel  did not need a single touch of fancy in the presentment what a singularly humiliating confession this statement should be if it were true in point of fact as all writers of picturesque history know it cannot be literally true it would only mean that the fancy of one writer was adopted by another and when that other is herself an artist in fiction the result if faithfully pursued would be a literary calamity not so do the great artists use history as scott in ivanhoe or george meredith in vittoria they learn its uses and its limitations the test of the historian is his accuracy but the critic must test mrs steele as a novelist not by her descriptions of the real scenes of the indian mutiny nor by her clever transcriptions of the chronicles but by the human beings and human characters wbich she invents the passions and ideas with which she invests them by the play of her creative talent round the creatures of her imagination as they move through the world which she has chosen as their environment and by her capacity for making an artistic unity out of the variety of circumstances it is in this respect that on the face of the waters is weak the desire to tell the whole history of the siege of delhi has interfered seriously with the human interest in the story up to p 210 there is a definite elot in the relations between major erlton is wife and his mistress but when mrs gissing falls the first of the women victims at delhi mrs steel violently removes the whole moral situation to which she seemed to be working upremoves it just at the climax when mrs erlton learns that another woman is to be a mother by her husband in a scene which till its natural sequel is ruthlessly cut off is full of promise for the working out of a most interesting problem of life alice gissing is certainly the most human of the characters in this story her relations with erlton whose wife is represented at first as bound to him by the nominal tie only are described with rare and even audacious sympathy  and when this chain of circumstance is abruptly snapped there is nothing to take its place the final two hundred pages one half of the book have no real human interest except the historical one mrs steel apparently intended the relations between jim douglas and mrs erlton to supply it but the sympathy of the reader is not aroused their adventures in the town in hiding while the mogul reigns in delhi and the british troops are besieging it from the ridge are most brilliantly narrated but they are the adventures of isolated beings both of them as bloodless as any men or women could be in such a situation and mrs steel evidently felt the mechanical aspect of their union after major erltons death when she relegated it to an appendix this division of the story into two parts one dealing with alice gissing and major erlton and the other with mrs erlton and jim douglasdeprives it of unity which is not adequately attained by the part played by douglas in both portions what unity the volume has is given by its history of the siege of delhi and to say this is to praise mrs steel the historian at the expense of mrs steel the novelist while we maintain that a great novel is not to be composed bv giving an historical background to several brilliantly interwoven episodes it must be admitted that mrs steel does ive us of her best in the way of episode in on the face of the waters all that relates to the natives whether to the sepoys or the court or the town is admirable and the sketches of british military and civil life are absolutely convincing mrs steel sees detail everywhere and records it minutely but she is full of humanity in the broader sense and can give us the mysticism of the oriental as faithfully as the easyoing morality of the angloindian each incident almost each chapter is a picture by itself revealing an extraordinary wealth of descriptive power and a masterly insight into character the disappointment is that with so muoh that is brilliant by itself the book as a whole finally lacks the intense interest which would be expected but mrs steel is so exceptionally gifted that we shall hope to see her shake off the disintegrating tendency which has so fatally pursued some of our best writers of sketches and short stories  novel notes on the face of the waters by f a steel 6s heinemann we do not meet with a novel of this order once in ten years it is a monument of patient labour a storehouse of precise facts on its imaginative side it is strong and deeply impressive architecturally it is a wonderbut we did not recognise this very early mrs steels aim was to write a history of the indian mutiny which should at the same time be a work of fiction the fiction to serve the history by lighting it up with living human interest as to her facts she says the reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part which real men took in it is scrupulously exact even in the date the hour the scene the very weather a critic of fiction has most concern with the other part and there we hold that mrs steel has used her vast array of knowledge with great skill that she has made us realise as we never did before the signs of the oncoming storm the mystery and tragedy of it the sensations of the natives loyal and disaffected and of the angloindians no one has taken such trouble before save historians and they have left the imagination out of the fineness of the detail it is impossible to speak too highly or of the great mental force that has shaped the mass of facts personalities sensations into a whole but it has the defects of its qualities a reader is sometimes overwhelmed dazed and baffled by the demands on his attention such a book should be given its best chancewhich is the careful consideration of ample leisure it is not a playhour novel but a bit ot hard reading with matter in it to reward the labour and to rouse the keenest admiration for the writers force and her sympathetic imagination  on the face of the waters new novels by flora annie steel heinemann mrs steel says in her preface  i have not allowed fiction to interfere with fact in the slightest degreeevery incident bearing in the remotest degree on the indian mutiny or on the part real men took in it is scrupulously exact even to the date the hour the scene the very weather nor have i allowed the actual actors in the great tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the accounts of eyewitnesses or in their own writings this statement is we believe strictly accurate and the local colouring is singularly exact the tale too is as valuable as it is interesting for it gives an excellent insight into the native side of the indian mutiny and into the characters of some of the leading personages  such as for instance the king and queen of delhi the moulvie and bukht khan on the other hand it brings vividly before us the conduct and bearing of some of the principal fighters on the british side such as nicholson and hodson moreover it most wholesomely revives our recollection of the scandalous behaviour of the majorgeneral commanding at meerut and the want of energy and independence displayed by brigadier archdale wilson the author notwithstanding her general accuracy has perpetrated one or two little mistakes for example she defines krani as lowcaste english whereas it really is the contemptuous term applied to halfcastes again she is historically inaccurate when she writes of the rifle brigade having been engaged at budle  ke  serai it was the 60th rifles who took part in that action the rifle brigade not having been represented in india till several months later viewed simply as a novel the book is well and vigorously written but we regret to find that the author is unable to shake herself free from the objectionable habit prevalent among so many lady writers of dragging in the sexual question freely this blemish renders the work unsuitable for young people,northamerica_contra

first futile attempt to fulfil the natural functions of motherhood if selfimposed task why moloch and what does mr grant allen mean by  its annual holocaust  rolf boldrewood is also falling back upon somewhat hackneyed characters and incidents his story is decidedly ghastly and ho spares neither his characters nor his readers the convict life of the innocent lance is told with much particularity and will certainly try the nerves of an average reader no doubt the author could quote chapter and verse by way of authority and this part of his narrative reads more like reality than some of the rest dr mac donalds present book is rather disappointing that there are highly poetic passages in it goes without saying yet it jg impossible to rate this volume as among his best it is eerie and mysterious with its strange spectral riders on the dark moor and the deep melancholy that seizes the lonely man with whom the child orba lives and that ever and anon drives him out into the inhospitable night but the mystery is too completely solved and the solution comes too near to the ridiculous the idea of a lady on board a ship is quite enough to set mr clark russell off it does not much matter whether the young woman is eloping or meets her hero for the first time in cabin or on deck he has done the thing before in both ways and as the reading public evidently likes a conjunction of neptune and venus from mr clark russell he will doubtless do it many times again the incidents of the  strange elopement  strike one as more improbable than those of any of the authors previous sea novels and the plot is as thin as thin can be but there is a dash of freshness in the narrative from first to last and it will not come amiss to a healthy appetite for novelreading a book dealing with cowboys and storekeepers rowdy emigrants and strange representatives of a spasmodic order and a frequently purblind justice does not raise high hopes but in the straightforward and vivid narrative which introduces the western hero from colorado to the little city in kansas the reader soon loses his slight repugnance to the theme and rapidly becomes interested in the simple story jeff grant is a very sufficient hero the rough life of the west which has strengthened his nerves and trained his eye has not hardened his heart or disqualified him for a more social existence when after an encounter in which he has saved the town apparently from sack at the hands of a  lowdown crowd he goes to visit the wounded prisoner in the laburnum gaol his motives are obscure to the sheriff  this man is very ill sheriff  i believe you he requires careful nursing what medicine are you giving him   none  did the doctor leave nothing  mr searle shrugged his shoulders  nary a drop he said it would be thrown away and he could not afford to physic rowdies  and it werent his business which is a fact of course  you mean he left this man to die  there was a vibration in jeffs voice which mr searle did not like excuse the remark mr grant but i think that you are unhitchin your tongue a leetle bit too free is ham kicks your prisoner or mine  jeff paused to consider the situationhe could have choked mr conrad searle what he did do was to draw from his pocket a piece of green paper which rustled with a pleasant sound how long will it take you to fetch doc quinter here sheriff  it is noteworthy that the same process very liberally applied saves the wretched hara not only from judge lynch but from the slightly more formal operations of regular justice although judge judas cochrane before whom the case was trie 1 had a strong pecuniary interest in his condemnation these methods however by common consent do not detract from though merit of the performance  the man who ll try to cure the wound he gives and stand between the cuss he dropped and a whole township if need be is rarer than a white buffalo there is a contrast between this manly merciful adventurer a gentleman at bottom and the rather supercilious young man from the east his rival in cleos affections but philip improves under reverses and we will hope shakes off some more of his cubbishness in europe whither he betakes himself after his relations with the heroine have been put on a brotherly footing that young person in spite of a squeamishness in the matter of rough clothing which an english lady would have neither felt nor exhibited is a very honest girl and deserves the satisfactory wedding fully detailed which concludes this artless but not uninteresting tale though its fresh local colouring is its principal merit there is much human nature in passages such as that in which ham takes thought to spare slapes children from the knowledge of a terrible shame mr bierces collection of american tales of horror is occasionally marred by extravagance of style and some of the more terrible descriptions of solitary suffering aro too long drawn out his themes are chosen for the most part from the civil war and it is characteristic of the nature of that struggle that the pride of soldiership nowhere appears in these descriptions we read of nothing but the minutest details of bodily and mental pain  of tragedies like  a horseman in the sky where a skirmisher shoots his father of the opposite faction who has bound him to  do his duty  in the war like  coulters notch where an artillerist plays upon his own house held by the enemy and slaughters unwittingly his wife and child like the frightful story of panic  a tough tussle when a man in an agonising state of nervous tension takes the corpse of an enemy for an assailant and is slain himself while engaged in his ghastly onslaught the hapless man was on outlying picket in a forest alone while his lunacy grew on him  he to whom the portentous conspiracy of night and solitude and silence in the heart of a great forest is not an unknown experience needs not to be told what another world it all ishow even the most commonplace and familiar objects take on another character the trees group themselves differently  they draw close together as if in fear the very silence has another quality than the silence of the day and it is full of halfheard whispers whispers that startle ghosts of sounds too such as are never heard under other conditions  notes of strange nightbirds the cries of small animals in sudden encounters with stealthy foes or in their dreams a rustling in the dead leavesit may be the leap of a woodrat it may be the footstep of a panther what caused the breaking of that twig  what the low alarmed twittering

place ah children of the sunlight and the gaslight how little you know of the world in which you live   it will be seen the writer can give a vivid description perhaps the most gruesome of all the military stories is that of the lost child at chickamauga who slept through the battle and guided by the wounded crawling to the river found its homo burnt its motherslain andwasstruck deaf and dumb with the shock in this the details are given with the sort of power one sees in a russian battlepiece and will repel more readers than they attract incidentally one can realise something of the visible experiences of that most strange titanic and unorthodox of wars with its ambitious strategy and confused manoeuvring and its incessant embarrassment owing to the vastness and complexity of natural obstacles we should consider this part of the book extremely unsuitable for young readers to whom it is surely more wholesome to present the nobler side of war of the civilian stories a holy terror and the middle toe of the right foot quite correspond to the promise of their titles and are calculated to be read with most result after a heavy supper though  a watcher by the dead and  the

to meet with the recognition which their unquestionable attractiveness deserves though author knows her country right well she is an adept in the use of dialect and displays a keen sense of contrast  the first mayor is a singularly vivid sketch of the feverish lifo of a mushroom western town while in  otto the knightthe story which gives its name to the collectionthe conflict of capital and labour is treated with a great deal of romantic charm octave thanet is particularly happy in dealing with the manners and superstitions of the negroes whose quaint turns of speech she reproduces with a

their accompanying tortures abductions and bloodshed abound and are rarely varied by those bright touches of humour for which jokai is famous the work is crammed with incident and adventure but the

quite alone new novels by george augustus sala 3 vols chapman  hall this novel is and will remain one of the curiosities of literature mr sala explains that half the story was written by him before leaving england as the correspondent of a daily paper more than a twelvemonth ago the publication of it was commenced at a later period in all the year round once engaged in america mr sala lost the thread of his narrative and when some hundred and twenty pages short of his goal ceased all remittances of manuscript it became necessary to bring the btory to an end and another hand was called in mr sala after returning to england preferring a close of his own very naturally promises his readers that if they will clear off the fiist edition as here given by the publishers of whom the ms appears to be the property he will write them a new last act we shall be very curious to see it under these circumstances the critic can only write in some sort conjecturally though five sixths of the tale are before him making allowance however for every drawback announced in this confession it would not be easy to name a more unpleasant story by a man whose fertility of invention and vivacity of style are indisputable  than this quite alone is unpleasant from the predominance of odious people to whom it introduces us blunt the heroine lilys father is one of those disgraceful men of pleasure who delight in flinging themselves down headlong ruining every one that touches or trusts themand whose death as it were on a dunghill excites more disgust than pity the diabolical french amazon who is blunts lawful wife their marriage not being the most explicable transaction in the career of one so licentious may be true to reality so far as her sensuality extravagance and ferocity are concerned but we regard her rather as a wild beast than as a human creature then constant blunts valet the lover of this equestrian pbcfiend in her days of village childhood ia worse than equivocal in his respectabilitythough he does rise from the honourable position of confidential familiar gobetween and moneypurveyor to his profligate master to fortune and the proprietorship of a westend hotel he keeps too throughout his experience of the foul secrets out of which he made his livelihood and fortune some sentimental tenderness for the french girl he had once loved who had grown up thanks to his master into such a debauched fury and keeps what is still stranger a no less sentimental recollection of their lawful child lily whom he has seen only during a very brief period edgar greyfaunt on whom the little heroine fixes her affections and for love of whom she flies from a kindly shelter miraculously provided for her is as worthless as lilys father a scoundrel too transparent in his vice and selfishness to captivate a creature so pure as she is described  to be the real una has in her composition sam thing of instinct that shrinks from corruption at well as of credulity that can be imposed on by specious flattery some of mr salas episodical figures are sketched with spirit and character the old lady of the faubourg and her household who for awhile receive the poor forlorn lily when she has been all but tortured into despair by the flinty french schoolmistresses on whose charity she had been thrown are gracefully and tenderly sketched the baronet old enough to be her father another man of profligacy and pleasure redeemed in part by his loving recollections of the child who had once sat on his knee during a greenwich orgy belongs we fear to the genus black swan re pulsive however as are many of the people jost enumerated mr sala nevertheless contrives to make us know them all and when he has finished his story in his own way he will perhaps have brought us to tolerate them a little more for this end we must wait in the mean time we can say that these characters are not the secondhand rascals frail women and devotees whodressed out in tawdry and faded stageclothes by the nathanb of novelliterature figure by the dozen in the bad books of the hour but have a certain vitality of flesh and blood belonging to themselves and their parent those who like excursions into the worst provinces of bohemia which contain their magnates as well as the wretched swarm of folk that tumble for their pleasure may find excitement in  quite alone  quite alone is a franklyexpressed  advertisement mr sala explains how it came to pass that the present novel which originally appeared in weekly portions in a ll the year round and which bears his name as the author was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the year round began the publication of the story without waiting to have  quite alone by george augustus sb three tolumes london chapom hall the whole of the manuscript in their hands mr sala did his best to finish the task he had set himself but failed  page by page he says  like so many drops of blod about two hundred slips of manuscript oozed from me between spring and summer they were written with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and sudden death in the month of august i brose down altogether and the mails went out without any of my tissue paper i had lost the thread of my narrative i had forgotten the very names of my dramatis pcrsowa i was in a new countrya new world among strange scenes and strange people hurrying from place to place badgered and hated always abused often in peril of my life and under all hazard compelled to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed it many steps beyond the outset from first to last the heroinewhose mysterious isolation suggests the title of the novelis the character of whom the reader is permitted to see and know least though it is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year round mr sala invites us to do so in fact promising that if a second edition of the book should be called for he will himself finish it according to his original intention as the story at present stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end clubloungers from the circumstance that she is constantly seen in all places of fashionable resort  quite alone this solitary young woman is the daughter of one francis blunt a roul who has squandered a handsome fortune and taken to pigeoning young spendthrifts as a means of living in splendour her motherwho is the most prominent character in the novelis a frenchwoman who has been waitress and drudge at a country inn boarder at a pension and then actress at a parisian theatre where she represented some great wicked lady covered with guilt and diamonds and created a furore the wickedness being portrayed with  rare fidelity from

lily is by this time is nearly as she herself can tell nineteen years of age and a model of gentleness and goodness though how she comes to represent so exactly the opposite of the distinguishing characteristics of her parents is mr salas secret if indeed he knows it is at this point that he has stopped the concluding portion of the bookwhich as a piece of literary handiwork does infinite credit to the gentleman who gallantly undertook it in the face of inevitable objectionwinds up the story in a manner thlat can hardly have been such as was contemplated by mr sala madamne ernestine is killed by a fall from her horse on the last nig ht of the  ranelagh  seasun  and lily turns out to be the heiress of an indian nabob and marries a sir william long a virtuous elderly gentleman who had seen her as a child with her mnother at a greenwich dinner to which he with some other  nien about town had invited the  countess as a novelist mr sala has never thoroughly succeeded that he fails we conceive to be in consequence of the method he has chosen in the present work there is abundant evidence of his dramatic faculty his observation of character is little less minute atnd exact than that which he displays with regard to material objects but his inveterate habit of  cataloguincr whatever he sees overrides all else in his mind and apparently destroys his sense of fitness and proportion he constantly works upon his frame to the neglect of his picture with all its faults as a novel however quite alone is a very remarkable book containing descriptions that perhaps no living english writer besides himself could have produced the chapters devoted to  the miss banny castles establishment to the  pension marcassin and to a dozen other subjects are perfect as  dutch pictures as

having never as yet written without engaging the readers interest whether he agrees with or dissents from her philosophies her dialogue is naturalher eye for character is keen she enjoys humour obviouslyshe calls out pathos skilfully few things have been met in modern fiction more touching than the fading away of the poor girl to whom margaret hale attaches herself on removing from the south to a manufacturing town in lancashire the poetical methodism of thisgirl111011011101 uncomplaining affectionthe mixture of rudeness and of reverence with which she looks up to the delicatelynurtured lady make up an admirable picture the author of  mary barton  seems bent on doing for lancashire and the lancashire dialect what miss edgeworth did for ireland and scott for the land across the border there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,northamerica_contra

the wingless victory by m p willocks lane 6s mr john lane is to be congratulated on having discovered miss willocks and if her latest work is not a great success it will not be creditable to the discernment of the reading public miss willocks is the stylist of the emotions she knows the moods and temperaments of both sexes and while we saw this in her first novel  widdicombe that book was after all only the promise of which  the wingless victory  is the fulfilment the story is really simple dealing with primitive persons in unalluring surroundings it is a case of one woman and three men or perhaps two men and a boy for archelaus rouncewell is scarcely old enough to be classified as a man when he falls under the influence of wilmot borlace the eccentric syren whose character dominates the book she has married mainly because she is tired of single life and although the union with the village doctor starts without any love on her side she has an idea that she can make him into a hero what opportunities for heroism he could have found in a dull cornish village it is difficult to say but wilmot is nevertheless disappointed and after a dangerous flirtation with archelaus  takes on  with a roger hannaford and is about to elope with him when conscience aided by the intervention of a disreputable woman johanna saves her and she returns to her husband repentant and ashamed then follows a period of penance for dr borlace has to leave challacombe and he deliberately selects another village where there is a plague of sickness here wilmot works out her salvation and when the end of the book is reached we find that everybody concerned has also come to a haven of rest and satisfaction this is necessarily a very brief sketch of the plot but it will suffice to show that miss willocks depends more upon her own skill in delineating and analysing character than in describing the sensational or the morbid the fact that she has not avoided the conventional happy ending and has yet been successful indicates her genuine strength a writer who can justify the conventional is an artist in words and miss willocks deserves this distinction she can be epigrammatic without being superficial and she can moralise without being prosy her descriptions of scenery are amongst the finest passages in the book even if they fall short of her incisive phrases when dealing with the small hypocrisies of human minds one sentence may be quoted  that summing up the fanatical devotion which we call  a mothers love mrs rouncewell one of the subsidiary characters is made to say every new child a woman gets is like a new patent medicine she always thinks it will do something wonderful for her and it never does miss willocks will be told that she shows the hardy influence but this will be an injustice talent such as hers was not and never could be acquired in any of the readymade schools of fiction it bears the stamp of originality  the wingless victory by m p willcocks john lane miss willcocks has followed up the success of her 4 widdicombe by a westcountry story which abounds in striking studies of character and real observation of human emotions she is bold here and there in her treatment of sex and seems to have been influenced by ibsen but her boldness is justified the two chief characters are introduced to us as a wedded pair the woman has made a manage de convenance or one might say de curiosite while the man is a doctor full of strength and uncouth oddity she is wilful and alluringone of those small dark women who suggest spanish blood the story tells how they won through much trouble to full understanding of the minor characters those who indulge frankly in western dialect are the bestindeed very good the author has certainly produced a notable novel as well as a good story it seems to us somewhat clogged by overelaboration of style and metaphor some of the descriptions of scenery are pretty enough but not really to the point they remind us

a lifts secret by mrs henry wood 2 vols wood whitten six years since for though pages of a serial this story of love amongst the rich and strikes amongst the poor is now for the first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living novelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a novelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no good puri posethe very thing

writer of the last century whose collection of popular stories volhs miirchen was edited by wieland his works ara classical but we must think them somewhat vulgar and cannot but applaud the omission of needless indelicacies in the translation of this very tale libussa is an excellent example of the spirit in which he took up old legends and of the halfmodern satirical garb he dressed them in two very powerful stories somewhat alike in their moral drift are the criminal from lost honour of schiller and the michael kohl haas of heinrich von kleist schillers would show that the extremes of guilt are never more surely engendered than by degrading punishments awarded to trivial offences von kleists that a man driven to desperation by the denial of justice may be made a criminal by his outraged sense of right this latter tale is unequal but we know few things in fact or fiction more masterly than the first half of it the scene where with forced calmness michael listens to the outrages committed on his servant is a piece of high tragedy the writer afterwards plunges into historical detail and somewhat soils his fancy with the thick dust of german chronicles but heinrich von kleist not to be confounded with an older author christian ewald von kleist was a remarkable person he belonged to what was called the romantic school bis works are edited by tieck at the beginning of the century and several of bis dramas particularly the kiithchen von heilbronn still keep the stage he bad a morbid aud sickly temperament and so much was this embittered by his hatred of the french invasion that he killed himself in 1811 when little more than thirty years of age two other stories in the collection may be named together as alike in tendency and belonging to the same class of vivid thoughtful satirical fantasy pieces these are the sandman of hoffman and the wonders in the spessart of karl von immermann we see in both the intention to laugh at the speculative and morbid tendencies of the germans and in both that nice and curious art which leaves the reader doubtful if the means employed have been fanciful or real there is no such natural form of supernaturalism as the german other nations at the best make clumsy work of it we should like to have quoted from the sandman which for the mingled satirical fantastical and horrible is a masterpiece of hoffmans brilliant genius but we can better detach one or two of the imaginative wonders of the spessart by immermann whose sudden death two or three years ago in the prime of his life and intellect was a great loss to german literature the hero of the story a disciple of albertus magnus in other words of the archspeculator hegel obtains sight of the interior life of the universe  in the block of mossy rock a light murmuring was audible it seemed as though the stone wished to move itself and could not like one in a trance the student looked upon its surface and lo i the green and red veins were

the trees plants and birds  among these all was changed likewise when he trod on the short brown moss it shrieked and groaned at the unsentle pressure and he saw how it rung its little hairy ands and shake its gr j en or yellow heads the stems of the plants and the trunks of the trees were in a constant spiral motion and at the same time the bark or the outer skin allowed him to look into the

exclaimed the dwarf shuffling on his knees up to the prince and clasping his feet  tell me what is wanting to this pie and why it does not suit your palate  let me not die for a handful of meat or flour   this will not avail you my good nose replied the prince laughing  even yesterday i thought you would not be able to make this dish as well as my cook know there is wanting a herb called sneezewithpleasure which is not even known in this country without it this pie is insipid and your master will never eat it in such perfection as i do  at this the duke flew into a rage and cried with flashing eyes   i will eat it in perfection yet for i wear by my princely honour that by toinoirou i will either have the pie set before you such as you desire it or the head of this fellow shall he spiked on the gate of my palace go you hound i give vou once more twentyfour hours cried the duke now the herb wanted is the very herb that will disenchant the dwarf and being lucky enough to find it

barren honour a tale by the author of guy livingstone 2 vols parker son  bourn the title of this novel is the clue to the lesson which it is intended to inculcate it is generally considered a high crime and misdemeanour against the laws of novel reading to glance at the end of a book till we have fairly and honestly worked our way through the preceding volumes up to the last page without having a notion wnat we shall find there but nevertheless we believe that by bearing in mind the catastrophe upon which the plot is hinged we are not only able to take a more lively and absorbing interest in the story itself but we are also better qualified to appreciate justly and without bias the powers and abilities of the writer in carrying out the design he has in view we do not therefore apologise for quoting here the last words of the author of barren honour  i have attempted he says to sketch roughly what befell a man very weak and erringwho was often sorely triedwho acted ever up to the light that was given him at the cost of bitter selfdenial and selfsacrificewho nevertheless in this life failed to reap the tithe of his reward alan wy verne was strong up to a certain point but he had not faith enough to make him feel always sure that he had done right in defiance of appearances nor principle enough to keep him from repining at results he could neither comfort himself nor others thoroughly he was a chival rous truehearted man but a very imperfect christian he dared not openly rebel against the laws of god but he was too human to accept unhesitatingly the fulfilment of his decrees throughout alans life honour usurped the place where religion ought to have reigned paramount he shrunk from shame when he would perhaps have encountered sin to that one principlesound enough if it had not been the ruling onehe sacrificed love and friendship and revenge and life thus it will appear that the author proposed to himself no very light or pleasant task when he undertook to prove by relating this story what a barren fruitless dreary comfortless and unsatisfactory thing honour becomes when a man has no higher principle of action no more solid basis on which to rest his future hopes sir alan wyverne had but one great object in life the desire to do his duty thoroughly as a gentleman and a man of honourand he did it but his life was a failure the story is an old one but not the less interesting for that sir hubert vavasour is an honest goodnatured reckless country squire with a mortgaged estate an idle son a lovely daughter and last but not least a clever and intriguing wife alan wyverne the squires nephew is not unlike him in character and the two are sincerely attached still more attached however is sir alan to his beautiful cousin helen and though he knows he has already wasted the chief of his substance in riotous living and that lady mildred will certainly  forbid the banns he nevertheless has the temerity to avow his affection to his cousin as well as to her father and ventures to indulge in some hope that it may be possible to arrange satisfactory settlements enabling him eventually to carry off the fair helen as his lawful prize sir hubert is quite aware of all the difficulties in the path but he cannot resist the temptation to make his daughter and his nephew happy so he shakes his bead and consents but owns he has not the moral courage necessary to announce the awful fact to my lady my lady however baffles them all she caresses her daughter playfully reproaches the culprits plan and fairly puzzles her husband by her tacit acquiescence but in her heart she makes a vow that  it shall never be  she thought that such a weddingdress would become her daughter worse than a windingsheet and she will leave no stone unturned to break off the engagement she goes to work warily and with caution and makes alan feel properly grateful to her for her great kindness and consideration she however contrives to persuade him to wait a twelvemonth before fixing the weddingday and she insinuates that her daughter is exacting and absurdlyjealous for the rest she trusts to her usual good fortune and lies in wait for an opportunity to make the most of the little advantages she has already gained on her sons max vavasour return home the tug of war begins in earnest max openly avows his regret at the marriage having been even so far settled he owns he  has no prejudice against wyverne personally for nobody has such weaknesses nowadays but it is a simple question of political expediency max brings his friend lord clydesdale to the dene it is too late now of course to hope any good can come of that but max and his mother understand each other and they have a year before them yet raoul tenth earl of clydesdale was the premier parti of england and a coarse selfish overbearing illlooking young man but it would have been a very proper match for helen and so lady mildred feels naturally aggrieved at the thought of how much had been lost by alans rash and precipitate conduct lord clydesdale moreover no sooner set eyes on helen than he began to think himself an illused man he could have made up his mind to confer on her the title of countess of clydesdale and he did not see what right wyverne had to secure the young lady without even giving him a choice in the matter it was not to be born with patience his friend and toady harding knowles suggests that many things might happen before the fatal twelvemonth is over  sir alan might die you know or miss vavasour come to her senses harding does not object to laying very long odds say 6000 to 50000 that the marriage will never take place the bet ls accepted and booked with looks of wicked crafty significance by knowles who for some trifling reason hates alan and is sadly in want of money from this moment the plot thickens alan is persecuted by letters with a curious cypher engraved on the envelope lady mildred and her daughter receive anonymous letters warning them to inquire into his conduct during his absences from the dene explanations are given and received but somehow they are not quite satisfactory lady mildred pretends to make excuses for him thereby doing his cause a great deal more harm than good helen has seen mrs lenox once and has heard of her often she is hurt and grieved at what she believes to be alans conduct with regard to that dangerous lady but she trusts him still and would conting to trust him till death only lady mildred takes care to prevent that and alan gives up his case as hopeless and retires from the field this is the weak point of the story it is extremely improbable that a man conscious of his own innocence and aware that a trap is likely to be laid for his ruin would voluntarily sacrifice the woman he loves for the sake of the woman who loves him nina lenox is a careless imprudent creature always in trouble either about love or money wyverne does not pretend to care the least about her but he was goodnatured and helped her out of her scrapes and thought her rather a bore than otherwiseyet sooner than betray her confidence to his future wife even in his own justification he quietly breaks off his marriage with helen and makes both her and himself miserable for the rest of their lives this is the great instance of alans preferring honour to every other virtue or even duty helen not caring much what becomes of her after this marries lord clydesdale and hates him though he frees her father from his heavy embarrassments and saves the dene from passing into the hands of the jew who had intended to secure the property for his own thereby earning for himself the eternal gratitude of lady mildred and her son max we will leave the dinodment of the story to unfold itself to its readers at their leisure feeling convinced that with a little judicious skipping of lengthy digressions and superfluous descriptions of character in the first volume they will never rest till they reach the end of the book there is a most exciting description of a fight with some poachers and another of a hunting feat of sir alans which will delight the male readers of barren honour and there can be still less doubt that every lady will sympathise deeply with the sorrows of the countess of clydesdale and be ready to lament the mistaken views of the too scrupulous sir alan who in everything but this overstrained sense of honour is about as perfect and loveable a character as can be met with in any novel of the present day,northamerica_contra

the school for saints by john oliver hobbes fisher unwin this fantastic story by john oliver hobbes is absolutely different from the ordinary novel for it has no particular plot and the characters walk in and out in a delightfully inconsequential manner in fact it resembles a succession of brilliant scenes interspersed with reflections rather than a connected story among other things there is a good deal of roman catholic lore introduced robert orange the hero turns roman catholic and he and his friends discuss religion with some fervour but they never become tiresome about it or give the impression that they are preaching at the reader one feels that the conversations are introduced more from the authors exuberant joy in the subject than from any wish to proselytize the book resembles indeed in this characteristic and in the clearness with which the most subordinate characters are defined laurence oliphants 1 altiora peto a book like this one written by a brilliant writer evidently under the obsession of a very strong religious idea but even in the case of such an artistic writer as john oliver hobbes the weakness of introducing a pet subject is curiously illustrated where the subordinate characters are so good by the comparative failure of robert orange the hero and his lady brigit who produce almost all the roman catholic talking and writing they do not seem to live quite in the same way as reckage and his brother lord wight lady fitzreeves and that accomplished scoundrel purflete the hero and heroine are elusive they seem more minds than persons and this coldness and want of directness in their presentation seems due to thef actthatthey are used chiefly for the emission of the authors ideas butas we have hinted the author riots in a wealth of minor characters whose conversation and acts are most amusing and convincing real and imaginary people are mingled in a most eccentric fashion disraeli is introduced by name though it must be confessed he is rather disappointing and an english ambassador to paris is brought in under a very thin disguise and for many of the other characters actuality is suggested by footnotes or parentheses purporting to represent actual events but there is no vulgarity about it and none of them depends for its interest on any likeness fancied or real to actual persons then the plot itself is wild enough to satisfy the fantastic character of the actors we are whirled off from paris to an english byelection and thence to general prim and a carlist rising in spain reigning grand dukes and their agents intrigue mysteriously and purposelessly throughout the proceedings and altogether it is one of the most fascinating olia podrida we have met for some time at the end the author promises to continue the history of mr robert orange and if the second part is half as good as this it will be decidedly welcome  the school for saints a new period in john oliver hobbes literary career begins impressively in  the school for saints she has travelled far since  the gods some mortals and lord wickenham and there was need for that was an ugly story with a nauseating atmosphere and the air in this one is pure even to austerity from the first her habit of smartness has been tempered by an intellectual outlook but here mental energy dominates the book making it a storehouse of suggestive things brilliant things paradoxical things which the reader should by no means pass by breathless for the story for these things make all the worth of the volume intellect conviction a personal vision of life have stamped themselves on the pages but the story the characters hardly ever help and often hinder the effect as a book it is a brilliant chaos as a story it is a complete failure probably the writer had no intention of making a vivid and balanced plot but there is clear evidence she aimed at the achievement of living human portraits orange is a dreary fiasco he is the young ladys hero handsome aristocratic of ancient lineage dignified portentously solemn a model of piety chivalry and the manners of the high world perfectly inhuman and a consummate bore we have met him before in the pages of ouida but there we could laugh at him here we dare not for he is the mouthpiece of the most admirable sayings his creator endows him with her own literary aptitudes his gait and conduct are wearisomely  the school for saints part of the history of the right honourable robert orange mp by john oliver hobbes 6s unwin immaculate and his style in detached passages ascribed to him is delightful the heroine brigit is impossible bred in a convent she yet talks and acts and comports herself at seventeen with the aplomb the eloquence the skill the trained intellect of an unusually experienced woman of fifty that she is the granddaughter of an emperor does not explain this on one occasion we are allowed to see her as the child she must have been  oh take me away from these people they are stronger than i am and they frighten me i feel my weakness while i am with them i try to look bold and clever but my heart always trembles and i know that in the end no matter how well i fight i must lose the day i am like a small bird on a battlefield  here for once the young fluttering girl is near us then disraeli is a mere shadow so are the carlists hercy is quite unnecessary the fairly well conceived characters are the dull whig reckagebut how much better would he have been in trollopes hands and penste fitzreeves the sentimental kindhearted little fool who is cleverly suggested and who by a triumph of christian feeling is hardly ever made fun of english politics the carlist agitation and the strong refuge of the catholic church are the matters chosen to be welded there is a description of an election but the picture of the fight is blurred the escape from prims soldiers is hardly more vivid there is an enormous amount of undigested catholicity including a long description of the boxa mors ceremony introduced apparently because disraeli was once present but whether he slept or scoffed or was reverential we do not learn the obiker dida on politics on society and human nature are all stimulating all excellently expressed the catholic attitude to life is ably and brilliantly expounded these things are the reason for the books being the incidents are detached tawdry in arrangement never inevitable hardly visualised john oliver hobbes is always original and her latest book demands that you should skip the story and feed on the comments and

old court life in france by frances elliot 2 vols chapman  hall there are few subjects better worth treating than the one now taken in hand by mrs elliot thc majority of english readers even those who have travelled abroad and lived in paris are lut imperfectly acquainted with the old court life of france they know something but little of the names of certain kings they know nothing or what is popularly called next to nothing of the people who surrounded those kings and who were often less puppets than movers and impellers of the sovereign such courtlife details present themselves to most readers as the scenes of a new drama on a subject if not entirely novel yet strange and attractive to an audience wearied with authors and actors who year after year go on thrashing the same modicum of chaff in such dramas as this court life there is great splendour com bined with much variety mrs elliots history is not strictly  history she makes her characters speak aa she imagines they would be likely to speak and we must say that mrs elliots imaginative powers are considerable she indulges in such writing as we find in sensation novels and allows us to witness a very liberal quantity of caressing and kissing which we dare say took place as described or ought to have taken place and so is artistically put in but when  stopping her mouth with kisses  is in the foreground of these courtlife incidents hardened as we are our modesty gets somewhat alarmed and wonders with trembling as to what the next stage direction may lead us to infer mrs elliots volumes begin with francis the first and close with louis the fourteenth the former king has always appeared to us as a fortunate ruffian who has had honour far beyond his deserts except valour of a certain sort he had not a single virtue and what would a man be without  the manly heart courage 1 louis the fourteenth was more of a gentleman in his vices than francis the valour of the grand monarque however was not of such a heroic nature as flatterers have proclaimed it to be louis southeast plaint de sa grandeur qui lattache aa rivage was not meant for satire but nothing more sarcastic was ever uttered it might have been said by a courtfool instead of by a courtly poet like boileau there is if the word be permitted a  rascalry  about most of the fine gentlemen who figure in the old court life francis the first could praise the virtue which he could not prize  her soul is as a rose without a thorn he said of his wife claude whom he killed by his brutal indifference mrs elliot truly says of the position of diana de poictiers mistress of the king and next of his son that nothing can more mark the freedom of the times than this liaison and she speaks of diana as being  one of the brightest ornaments of the court the royal mistress was in truth as beautiful a piece of shabbiness as ever lived but morals were in a very confused state francis who after his capture at pavia said or is suppose to have said all is lost except honour stooped to tell a lie in order to get free and according to mrs elliot his sister marguerite prompted the chivalrous monarch to that unchivalrous act when mary stuart appears upon the scene there is a sense of a pleasant change but mrs elliot might have made more of her that hapless queen never looks so bright as when saying smart things against catherine de medicis the marquis de bouilli has noted some of them in his  history of the dukes of guise mary took especial delight in expressing her contempt for catherine as belonging to a family that had been in trade perhaps mrs elliot has been afraid to say of marguerite de navarre all that was to be said and indeed it would make the hair stand on end to read it  she lives in a world of intrigue is a mild form of speech by which to describe one side of the life of this orthodox and erotic lady while to say that  she pendulates between henri de guise and le molle and a thousand other flirtations is a form indicating a certain regularity in a life which was altogether irregular we confess to little or no admiration for most of these people we do not feel any remarkable reverence for that vert galant henri quatre nor do we acquiesce in mrs elliots judgement as to the feminine tenderness of henris mistress gabrielle destrees the mother of henris son the duke of vendome in succeeding chapters the romance of history is not so well told as the history without the romance in the count de st aulaires  histoire de la fronde and when we come to the period of louis the fourteenth we hardly know which are the worse the showy swaggering men or the audacious shameless women lauzun was the typical frenchman of a long period there are a few exceptionally good individuals who occasionally turn up in the moving crowds at the court of louis the fourteenth and ono la valliere who like the young augustine thought pleasure should come before repentance a scene between the lady and louis the fourteenth will give the reader au idea of what we may call the subdued lovestyle of the writer in which she calls in the imagination of her readers to endorse her own   pressed by the king to grant him some mark of her favour la valliere becomes so confused she cannot reply louis grows more and more pressing interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit in the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder again bursts forth and poor louise overcome at once by fear love and remorse swoons away the king naturally receives the precious burden in his arms he seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his attendants in order to obtain assistance ever and anon he stops in the openings of the forest to admire her as she lies calm and lovely in repose her long eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheeks her halfclosed lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth i leave my readers to imagine if louis did not imprint a few kisses on the fainting beauty ho bears so carefully in his arms and if now and then he did not press her beloved form closer to his breast if in this he did take advantage of thc situation chance bad afforded him he must be forgiven  he was young and he was deeply in love words cannot describe the surprise felt by la valliere on recovering to find herself alone born along in the kings arms in the midst of a lonely forest history does not however record that she died of terror or that she even screamed  but perhaps and indeed doubtless she would have done so had not the respectful behaviour of the king reassured her  old court life in france old court life in france by frances elliot chapman and hall historical romance is the handmaid of history even when history has emancipated itself from the level details of the old chroniclers and lives for us in the pages of a macaulay or a froude with something of the passions and changing interests of real humanity there yet remains a place for the historical romance history i3 by profession at least impartial its backward gaze is too comprehensive to allow minute portraiture its aims are too lofty to admit of any but the widest sympathy the nation or the individual as he contributes to the national life is the historians theme in his true function he is a methodioal accountant taking stock of the past who omits nothing balances the errors of one man against the failings of another the greatness of one state against the ambition of another adds nothing to and takes nothing from the facts and figures that lie before him and finally presents the world with his estimate of results in however perfect a manner this operation be performed it is evident that there is yet room for the historical romance rightly composed the romance clothes its heroes with no more living and personal interest than they possessed ra the flesh  but it contrives by a due subordination of details an artful grouping of the principal figures and a light as of the natural heavens thrown on the picture from above to make the whole world appear subservient to that particular spot in space where the little drama enacts itself if the rom ancewriter is a poet so much the better shakespeare though he drew from no other source than dry old hollingshed has filled the story of the plantagenets as far as he told it with life and energy  calling to his aid the fluellens the bardolphs and the falstaffs he made the reigns of our plantagenets something more than landmarks of english history if we had one sterling writer of national romances with genius enough to raise him above the level track of history and yet no coiner of mere fancy with an alloy of fact we should perhaps be greater as a nation in proportion as we saw in the light of today the greatness and littleness of the past mrs elliot does not write historical romance in this way she occupies an intermediate place between the romancer and the historian she presents history in what margaret of newcastle would have called a  romancical dress her method lacks the continuity and completeness of dumas but it allows of greater accuracy and a closer study of character useless details are avoided the material is scanty and at times almost crude  but irrelevant matters are suppressed and those on which must hinge our conceptions of the mans character are thrust sedulously to the front it must be confessed that to interest the reader on such a plan is an arduous attempt it would have been easy to fill in the story with a few legitimate and even historical incidents but mrs elliot has it seems feared to mar the general effect by redundancy  she has avoided the full narrative style of miss freer for instance and elaborated instead a series of animated scenes which in word gesture dress and attitude are intended to be the counterpart of history that mrs elliott has failed sometimes to present in due relief the historical personages who serve as subjects for her nice pen is not to be wondered at that she has succeeded so well as she has is a matter of congratulation one danger we may safely say she has entirely escaped her chapters though often short and fuller of matter than of words are never tediously epigrammatic though it is impossible in this style of work that the artist should be lost in the picture you are not called away too often to admire her artistic qualities the first eight chapters of old court life in france are devoted to francis i his two queens first claude and then elinor of spain one blameless layfigure succeeding another appear the necessary appanages of a court diane de poitier and anne duchesse detampes are the true queens of the hour mistresses not only of the king but in some small degree of the destinies of france the dynasty of mistresses is however scarcely inaugurated in the time of francis the first marguerite de valois and constable bourbon complete the picture in this first essay however mrs elliot is by no means at her best the second group fuller of dramatic incidents offers greater facilities for success catherine de medici the mother of three worthless kings the organiser of the squadron of court beauties the inventor of the sidesaddle forms the central figure from the time fatherinlaw francis  romped with her the entire evening after her arrival to the day when half a century later she lay on her deathbed while the due de guise was murdered overhead this was that due de guise whom the second marguerite de valois would have married but that her mothers ruthless will gave her to the bearnois henry of navarre most of those men whose fortunes and destinies were mingled with catherines during her halfcentury of power and in whom dumas found a neverending source of mystery and intrigue cross mrs elliots stage she has treated them and everything that concerns catherine with much dramatic power and we are inclined to think that this series contains the best written of her sketches as a specimen of vivid description take this of the familiar party of three mother and two sons watching the st bartholomew massacre from a closet over the gate of the louvre to them enter navarre and conde

remarkable precision from the window with hideous mirth he boasts to navarre and conde how many heretics he has brought down with his own hand he counts upon his fingers the names of the huguenot chiefs already slaughtered he yells with fiendish laughter when he describes how coligni whom the night before he had called  father looked when dead  by the light of god it is a royal chase  shrieks charles as the page quickly reloads his arquebuse u that last shot was excellent not a heretic shall be left in france again he points his gun and shoots  a piercing cry follows charles nods his head approvingly we will have them allbabies and their mothers  break the eggs and the nest will rot our mother says wellwe must reign we will no longer be contradicted by our subjects we will teach them to revere us as the image of the living god you princesand as he turns to address the king of navarre and conde his tall gaunt figure distorted countenance bleared and bloodshot eyes and matted hair are repulsive to look uponyouprinces i have called hither out of compassion for your youth to give you a chance for your lives as you are alivebut by the holy oriflamme  thought you were both dead already the scenes which unfold the life of henri iv are scantier than we could wish and the episode of gabrielle destrees occupies rather too many of them undoubtedly the most important figure in her  show of kings henri iv deserves a larger space than mrs elliot has allotted to him quitting henri iv mrs elliot comes to the times of richelieu mazarin and anne of austria annes husband the bilious and melancholy louis xih surnamed  the just is summoned to live again his miserable unkingly career in her pages and we then drop suddenly upon louis xiv inaugurating his reign with the ruin of la valliere we cannot however attempt to follow le grand monarque whose court life occupies the latter half of mrs elliots second volume the sketches grow more voluminous towards the close  the last of them is called  the end and from it we make the following quotation  then the dying monarch turned his face towards madame de maintenon who was seated within the ruelle of the bed 41 madame he said in a low voice  i regret no one but you i have not made you happy his voice hitherto firm now faltered but i have one consolation in leaving you he added  we shall soon meet again he tried to look at her but madame de maintenon turned from him with disgust she huddered  what a rendezvous  she muttered half aloud  he cares for no one but himself bolduc the kings apothecary was near and heard her say so that very day she left him while he dozed and drove away to saintcyr on sunday the 1st of september louis died his confessor the jesuit letellier never returned madame de maintenon remained at saintcyr save the cardinal de rohan and the parish priest of versailles all had forsaken him no sooner had  breathed his last than precautions were necessary to guard his body from insult  e are not of the opinion that much is to be learned from the extravagant licence and splendid vices that ruled te court of france mrs elliot has confined her story within courtly bounds and offends no one by the plainness of her speech but after all an intrigue is an intrigue whether the parties to it are kings and duchesses or grooms and servingwomen  and we venture to doubt the ultimate use of such a book as mrs elliot has produced with this reservation we confess to a keen appreciation of the artistic merits ot  ula uourt late in trance hp  oli court life in france this is the fifth edition of a book that has had many readers and many critics it is the kind of book that is especially annoying to scientific students of history who are both jealous and scornful of narratives treated without tootnotes and without much visible aid from documentary evidence unless they are labelled  imaginative literature mere scraps of history in picturesque setting lay figures with historic names affixed and made to play the part which some contemporary gossip has assigned to them are to their mind frivolous and from an educational point of view dangerous the critics are wrong we should never think of going to such books for exact information on every page of this one for instance we feel how the materials have been cooked the scantiest knowledge of history is enough to make us often read characters and motives differently but it does give the popular idea and picture of the personages and events described from a long study of contemporary memoirs from long familiarity with the country the authoress has learned the fitting stage properties has noted the gossip and the anecdotes she has used all her gathered materials not with imaginative power but with the skill and swiftness of the scene painter and scene shifter the result is a nondescript kind of thing neither history nor romance but it is very readable it is a very vivid series of pictures we are given of the princes and lords and ladies of gay old france from francis and marguerite of valois and diane de poitiers down to the last days of the grand monarque when court gaiety died out under the heavy influence of the maintenon and the troubled dawn of a new world the plates from miss pardoes  memoirs of the french court have been reproduced in these volumes which are reissued in a very

a bachelor maid by mrs burton harrison autonym library is 6d unwin this is not an entirely successful story and it is based on a subject driven to death just now but much is to be forgiven it for the sake of the heroines sensible statement on the last page that  she had come to regard the woman question as one involving the whole not half of the human race there is abundance of incident in the story and some phases of modern life are described with much cleverness but we confess to have skipped partly because the interest has a way of dying down every tenth page or so and partly because the type is bad shorter tales would be more beneficial to the eyesight of readers of the autonym library,northamerica_contra
the wheel o fortune by louis tracy ward lock 6s the adventures of dick royson in search of a mysterious buried treasure in an african desert are conventional enough but mr tracy writes sufficiently well to make his book interesting reading the young man is introduced to us as he watches a procession of the unemployed he too is out of employment a timely carriage accident however provides him with an opportunity of displaying his prowess and as a result he is engaged by baron von kerber to be the second mate of the aphrodite the yacht which is carrying mr fanshawe his daughter mrs haxton captain stump and his crew to africa royson is the heir to a baronetcy and a large income but this fact is kept a secret to miss fanshawe and the reader until the proper time for its publication meanwhile royson falls in love with miss fanshawe of course and it also follows that his proposal comes before the knowledge of his change of fortune reaches him this is all part of the modern novelists extreme fondness for proving the sincerity of his hero and heroine however the lovemaking forms a small part only of  the wheel o fortune all the mystery surrounding buried treasure is drawn upon for surprise and countersurprise  the interest in the baron and mrs haxton is worked up to a strong pitch but in the end the author has very little to tell of them an author should see that he can manufacture a good solution as well as a good mystery and mr tracys weakest spot is the conclusion of his story mr tracy is by now a wellknown writer of sensational novels and his latest book whilst striking no new line or probing deeply into the problems of life is a good specimen of the storynovel pure and simple we have met many dick roysons before and they have performed many of the feats mr tracy describes that fact however will not trouble the authors readers they like a readable exciting story and in  the wheel o fortune  they will get it,northamerica_contra
a soldier of manhattan by joseph a altsheler smith elder  cothere seems to be a sort of convention about historical novels dealing with war and fighting which is convenient and amusing the hero is almost invariably in love with a highborn damsel on the other side who is already engaged to a villain on her own sidethe rest is obvious consequently the whole point of the book lies in the circumstances here the circumstances are exciting enough as they relate to the taking of quebec by general wolfe and though campaign preceding it mr gilbert parker has written a novel on the same events but this book in no way trenches on his ground as it is entirely written from the english or rather the american point of view in fact mr altsheler seems somewhat concerned in dwelling on the merits of the colonist as opposed to the english soldiers in this war but this is quite by the way and does not interfere with the really exciting adventures of lieut charteris in his encounters with indian and french sharpshooters as a french prisoner in his escape from quebec with a halfcaste and in the final attack on montcalms position it is an exciting book vividly written in which the hero performs all that such a hero should do with courage and modesty the pseudonym knarf elivas is really a fair sample of the extent of the ingenuity of the author of the story of john ship mariner a romance of the faroe isles sampson low  co it is an historical romance and contains a hero a heroine a villain the inquisition a shipwreck and a sunken treasurein short all the good old materials treated in the bad old way there is a subtle suggestion about the book as of something one has met before and a clear impression that one would rather not meet it again  a soldier of manhattan and his adventures at ticonderoga and quebec by joseph a altsheler smith elder  co the home supply of historical novels is so large that we cannot see any reason why it should be reinforced from abroadparticularly if the novel is of indifferent quality mr joseph a altsheler we take it is a native of the united states of america and his soldier of manhattan is of very indifferent quality indeednay more it may be justly described in common parlance as  pretty bad his story covers about the same ground as robert louis stevensons fine ballad about ticonderogalike that it even introduces a highland officerand gilbert parkers seats of the mighty and by comparison even with the latter his performance is not worth mention but there is a point of view from which it may well be taken note of though only to be condemned mr joseph a altsheler would seem to have told his story for no other purpose than to prove that the american soldier was in those troublous times of george m not only as good as the british but a darned sight betterthe which is supererogatory at this time of day and altogether beside any purpose of art there is a british officer named culverhouse who is clearly meant to be goodnatured stupid conceited and entirely typical of his country here is a passage concerning an adventure of a scouting party in the backwoods of which culverhouse is one and zebedee a backwoods  boy is another  we paused again by a little brook that whispered a song as it threw coils of silver over the pebbles  i suggest that we go no further said culverhouse as he gasped for breath  it is not becoming in an officer in his majestys service to fly thus from any danger at all far less from any danger that he cannot see and that he does not even know to exist  the dangers real enough i tell you said zebedee  them woods behind you are swarming with the hurons an they mean to have us  i suppose its as you say said culverhouse  im willing to admit i do not know much about this manner of making war 1 what queer people these red fellows are  said culverhouse again meditatively  and how they violate all the rules of war     and what a sanguinary desire they evince to obtain our scalps  continued culverhouse he felt for his hair which was very abundant and then said ruefully to me  to think i should be threatened with such a fate i who have danced with a princess of the blood royal there is a good deal more of such skimbleskamble stuff which sets forth no possible person at all but a creature of mere farce and of farce with an animus,northamerica_contra
