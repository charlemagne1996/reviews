robert falconer new n0vku8 bygeorge macdonald lld 3 vols hurst  jlactcett readers whom dr macdonald will never know or hear of will be grateful to him for having written robert falconer and it is in these secret responses to his words that a writer finds his true reward before any satisfaction can be derived from thu work the reader most be at tfae pains to master the quaint scotch dialect in which most of the conversations are carried on the book b well worth the small effort thb will require he will be amply repaid by the racy humour and original phraseology which are found in every page robert falconer is the matured utterance of all the thoughts and aspirations which dr macdonald tried to say or sing in hb early poems and the oompleted picture of what he set forth in more or less fragmentary form in hb previous novels he has fulfilled all hb promises and thb b saying no little we could find fault with the construction of the storywith many of the incidents some of which are left half developed and unsustained and one or two which are unnatural exaggerated and strained but as a whole it b a work to which a man may sign his name and feel that he has honestly put forth his best strength to do it effectually  robert falconer sontains the experience of many years of life both personal and observed the object of the work b to kindle in those who read it the desire to find what fichte calb  the way to the blessed lifestill more to excite the desire to walk therein although  robert falconer b not a book to be taken up for amusement and though readers who are merely in search of a novel for light reading had better consider themselves hereby warned to let it alone it b neverthless a work brimfull of life and humour and of the deepest human interest to all who care to read of life and death and the deep heart of man it b a book to be returned to again and again for the deep and searching knowledge it evinces of human thoughts and feelings not only in different phases of the same character but in entirely different natures dr macdonald works out and developes the process of education in a human soul through the medium of the outward and  changing scenes of life from the first vague imaginings of the childbh heart to the full development and harmony of all its powers the interest of the story as a narrative lies in the strong individual personality of each character and in the subtle elaboration of incident so as to show how all things work together how events which at the time seemed only dreary and calamitousthe destruction of a mans best hopes and most innocent aspirations  are in reality steps in the process of transformation into a better and nobler character so that he b enabled by their means to realise the very best of all that he b capable of being or becoming the gut of the story deab esperially with those phases of religious doubt and unrest which are the characterbtics of the present daythe problems that occur to pious thoughtful men who are troubled by the different forms of theology by which men have striven at once to exhibit religion and to protect it from a too near approach the story shows in its progress that light arbes for the upright and that those who truly desire to learn will be taught the moods of inquiring mindsdiffering apparently in each individual but alike in all as regards their root and tendencyare drawn with subtle and wonderful skill the distinction between the pains of healthy growth in the soul and the morbid sickness of dbease b kept clear for the reader by the skill of the authors power of analysb the whole drama of life is set forth as played by many characters all of them acting more or less upon each other as b the case in real life robert falconer b the central character he b represented as reaching the highest moral stature and most thorough and wellbalanced development through him the author utters hb own thoughts and convictions but the other personages are all true to nature and some of them come home to ones sympathies more than robert the scotch dialect in which nearly all the conversations are carried on lends itself to quaint and felicitous expressions which give weight and individuality to the words robert falconer is a scotch laddie brought up by his grandmother who is a fine character a strong calvinist and deeply religious with no conception of any religion apart from her own creed but with a heart full of lovingkindness and a sense of justice which is stronger even than her love she has one heartgrief her only son the father of robert has cone to the bad and after a career of drunkenness and debauchery in which he wasted his fortune and broke his wifes heart he has utterly disappeared in a slough of degradation roberts first mystery is the questioning about his father from broken words and shadowy recollections he comes to feel intense pity for him and resolves when he becomes a man to go into the world to seek him he puts into his prayers every night a petition for his father the poor old grandmother with her heart made still sorer by her stern calvinism prays for him too with an earnestness that nothing short of a firm belief in that terrible creed can inspire one day a report comes that he is dead and then she recognises that she must no longer hope or pray for one who is dead and whose state is fixed the whole of this scene is wonderfully true the stern sense of right and duty by which the stately old lady silences the cry of her heart is more touching than any effusion of words roberts difficulties with his creed are beginning  he steadily refuses to believe in the report and persists in his prayer for his father the desire for his fathers restoration is the ruling thought of his heart and shapes his whole life when he is free to go out into the worldafter a long and difficult training in which all hope or desire for any personal happiness has been taken from himhe gives himself up to the search for his father and in the course of that quest he goes about doing good in the worst dens of london misery working out the authors own ideas of the principle and method upon which such things should be done whilst robert is undergoing the training of education and circumstances the reader is in sympathy with him but when he becomes the authors ideal of a perfect philanthropist he has acquired a touch of selfconsciousness which mars the effect,stories_contra
new novels the two lancrofts by c f keary 3 vols osgood mcllvaine  co mk keary has given us in  the two lancrofts a powerful if somewhat painful story which fulfils the promiseor perhaps we should say rivals the performanceof a marriage de convenance a note of forcible simplicity is struck at the outset in the contrast between the two cousins from whom the book derives its name and wherever the author follows his heroes afterwards on either side of the channel their surroundings are described with a fidelity to detail and a sureness of touch which recallat a considerable interval no doubtthe method of de maupassant it is obvious indeed from the first that mr keary has made a close study of french models and his frugality of diction his lowtoned colouring and we may add his rather coldblooded cynicism may all unquestionably be traced to a gallic source it is by work like this that we english who affect to complacently despise our nearest continental neighbours in other departments of national activity such as politics and sport are fain to confess the continued supremacy of paris amid all her vagaries as the artistic centre of europe and of the world the poetry and the fiction of this country are at present at all events in the case of their younger exponents peculiarly sensitive to french influences here and there a feeble and halfhearted protest may be made by one who desires in spite of all temptations to  remain an englishman  but for the most part we are content to lie down in the dust in an ecstasy of selfsurrender and let the car of the impressionist juggernaut roll proudly over our prostrate bodies  the two lancrofts then bears unmistakable signs of its alien inspiration and exhibits the excellences and defects which we have learned to associate with a particular school of french writers its language is clear and concise if at times lacking in distinction and unnecessarily garnished with expletives its descriptions of natural objects when they occur are by no means over elaborated but form a fitting background to the slightly prosaic personages of a drama that verges on the sordid there is also a certain want of coherence and continuity in the book due to the abruptly kaleidoscopic appearances of its bank clerks its art students its savants and its smarts to use the detestable vulgarism which mr keary unblushingly commits who have little or nothing to do with each other and whose scrappy aphorisms do not materially assist its action or contribute to its general effect when he has but two or three of his characters on the stage on the other hand though author is at his best as in the scenes between the two cousins and thyrza lomoine where the concentration and energy of the dialogue well express the conflicting passions of the trio while their actual relations haud more gallico are treated with a commendable reticence and reserve wo cannot however feel so much interest in willie lancroft as we fancy mr keary wishes us to do he presents a combination of vanity and clumsiness which his other good qualities physical and mental scarcely succeed in making attractive and to tell the truth for so clever a man his conversation is remarkably heavy we much prefer the slapdash slangy vivacity of hope lancroft who has certain affinities with dick heldar in mr kiplings story the light that failed and conveys to the reader a distinct impression of ability of thyrza no more need be said than that with her morbid selfconsciousness and illregulated emotionalism she is an excellent specimen of her class ela featherstone raised hopes in our own as well as the heros breast at the beginning of the second volume which were dashed to the ground before the middle of the third she ought we think to have treated willie lancroft with more consideration  but he certainly was a bit of a bore and she was probably happier with her rising politician it is impossible to notice all the people who jostle each other in the pages of mr kearys novel but a word must be spared for the oxford don and exrugby master mr sloanejarvis who very nearly attains to the dignified position of a type  hle two lancrofts mr kearys first book  a marriage de convenance was remarkable not only as an attempt in the rare epistolary form but as a powerful if somewhat morbid analysis of a character and its ruin the present work will it is to be feared prove a disappointment to those who hoped that mr keary would advance on his first performance it is the story of two cousins wvilly and hope lancroft and it is in one sense at least an artistic novel for hope lancroft who is a successful black and white artist brings willy over to stay with him in paris and provides for him till he can provide for himself by literature so there are many episodes and chat acters drawn from the artstudent world in a highly realistic manner and much criticism of the methods and aims of modern fiench art with of course an equal amount of literary talk and literary society which centres round willy lancroft he is the principal figure in a melancholy book which traces first the death of his young enthusiasms and then his desertion of the ideals which he had set before him in his art and in his life mr keary has again depicted the break up of a character but the cleverest sketch in the novel is the figure of thyrza lenmoine an actress with whom hope lancroft is in love but who falls in love with willy and consoles him for his rejection by ela featherstone a wellborn and imposing vacuum peopled by him with attractive qualities it is characteristic of mr kearys point of view that he makes thyrza consummate willys literary ruin by inducing him to write with her assistance a popular and successful play be has no high opinion of the modern stage the description of the process of rehearsal however is one of many pieces so to say of extrinsic interest which this book contains and for the sake of which many people will read it with pleasure mr keary is nothing if not up to date he works according to the newest methods recognises the newest masters and describes the newest phases of life and art what he has to say in criticism of all these things is well worth hearing for it bears all the marks of being thought and felt at first hand but to a person with oldfashioned ideas of storytelling it will probably appear that mr keary overloads his story with descriptions and dissertations descriptions even when they are so distinctly drawn as that of the london bank to which willy is at first condemned ought to make a small proportion not the bulk of a book and character reveals itself better in action than in conversation nor is it a wise thing to make your hero deliver a lecture upon literature what is best in mr kearypathos and a certain turn of thought peculiar rather than novelshows more in the fine sonnet of the last chapter than elsewhere in this book s l wynn   the two laucrofts and co by c f

queen lucia this is decidedly one of the most amazing and clever stories that mr benson has written  there is a cleverness that maketh bitterness to abound says an old jewish sage it is a kind of cleverness which is familiar in fiction as well as in social intercourse an unfeeling smartness which is satirical and sarcastic modern society especially in the case of idle rich people must be a constant temptation to the clever novelist and mr benson has already shot his arrows at the crazes of society women in particular but in this novel he is genial and delightful there is no acid touch of superiority he describes the life of a little community called riseholme in which the leading spirit is mrs emmeline lucas  she was always known among her subjects as lucia pronounced of course in the italian mode la luciathe wife of lucas  her little social ruses her affectation of culture her pseudoenthusiasms and her friendships are the theme of the novel which fairly brims with goodhumoured fun the advent of a mock indian guru and of two spiritualistic   queen lucia by e f benson 8s 6d net hutchinson charlatans are the main incidents which ruffle the pool of life at riseholme but a great operatic singer also takes up residence in the community and these changes threaten to burst the social harmony of queen lucias domain in fact she is exposed and humiliated during the course of affairs but this is where mir benson saves the situation he might easily have ended the book in a minor tragedy but he takes the better way and by bringing out the magnanimity of the actress he leaves riseholme still under the sway of its queen his light deft touch handles the situation without spoiling it the result is that we get our novel from beginning to end in the same vein mr benson amuses us with the silly crazes for vegetarianism christian science eastern mysticism spiritualism and the rest of the decadent enthusiasms which occupy the minds of unoccupied people he makes us familiar from the inside with the members of the riseholme society till we know  georgie with his false hair his embroidery and his uncomfortable sisters daisy quantock the colonel and the rest of them but while we laugh at them the laughter is not harsh it is satire with the buttons on the foils de congratulate mir benson upon this clever little sketch it is artistic and thoroughly llnulsing james moffattr,stories_contra
the some of the dragon by anna catha rina pseudonym library fisher unwin these seven disconnected stories of life in french tonquin which the author strangely calls a tonquinese idyll are pretty enough in their way but there is nothing distinctive enough about them to convey any very vivid notion of the life out there as apart from life elsewhere you are told that the people do so and so but you are not convinced that they would have done it take as an example the account of the religious excitement and processions in the story called  a riverside pagoda and compare it with a rather similar scene in the little volume of the same series by signor verga lately reviewed iu these columns in the latter case the people must inevitably have acted as signor verga says they did  one feels that they could not have done otherwise but in this story anna catharina tells us that they beat their drums and got excited and we believe it but we should believe it just as much if she told us exactly the contrary there is just wanting the artists touch to give the spark of life  the home of the dragon a tonquinese idyll told in seven chapters by anna catharina pseudonym library is 6d untwin the title is not very descriptive for it is not one tonquinese idyll but several the thread of connexion between the chapters being of the slightest however that is of little consequence the stories are exceptionally good indeed only a few in what has now become a very cosmopolitan series can compare with them there are two veins of interest running through them the european french colonial and the native and it is in the native stories the writer proves her undoubted talents she has made this unfamiliar country live for us not by laboured descriptions but by lifelike touches of nature and human nature the annamite huts the pagodas by the riverside the yellow tonquin river the bamboo rafts on it the lotus flowers on the lakes we see these vividly as the inevitable circumstance of the stories the principal characters mainly women are all pathetic patient creatures with much sweetness of nature and capable of great affection and heroism there is a fascination about their simplicity of life and speech which captures our sympathies as we read they have found a skilful interpreter the riverside pagoda the tale of the blight on the children is a masterpiece,stories_contra

  our manifold nature by sarah grand heinemann the title here is too big for the contents and the preface much too highpitched a great observer of human kind and its exponent through the medium of fiction would have fought shy of a name suggesting so much or if not like balzac would have justified his choice by the strenuous efforts of a lifetime there is something very far wrong when halfadozen second or thirdrate stories representing hardly halfadozen distinct types of human beings out of a world teeming with differences wears such a title unblushingly then why a novelist should ever write a preface is not very comprehensible but at least some care should be taken that it be pitched in the right key this one here is addressed to some not very intelligent critics who have been greatly concerned as to whether the writers methods be artistic she contends so far as we can understand her not altogether coherent words that art is what you like to make it we would respectfully suggest that her theories of art will be of more value when her achievements are a little more and appeal to her to recognise the true direction of her work instead of using the cant of the day and posing as an artist because she writes stories the artists of the world are few the story writers even the good ones many and much needed the great success of the heavenly twins was a fact full of significance which cannot be dismissed flippantly on the ground of the bad taste of the public but its success had nothing to do with artistic reasons how much of it was owing to popular curiosity on subjects which conventional society has hitherto turned away its face from is doubtful some of it was certainly due to the fact of madame grand s distinct capacities for stimulating and leading popular opinion she takes herself and her mission seriously not to say solemnly the first requisite of a teacher she has the courage of her opinions which are not too much in advance of the time to make her a social martyr or a voice crying in the wilderness why then instead of posing as an artist which certainly leads her into affectations does not this really talented writer keep singly in view the work for which she is fitted that of a social reformer but too much about a preface perhaps before coming to the stories  the yellow leaf and  eugenia are both mostly about young women some of whom have madame grands very excellent ideas about morality and who accordingly prosper and one of whom has the conventional idea of society on the subject and comes to a bad end her heroines are exceedingly selfconscious and their stories are a little dull there is not a ray of humour anywhere unless the conversation of the countrywoman of property with the authoress be accounted humorous  and when you write a book do you put in the stops yourself stops and everything oh no not the stops of course  all that must be done for you but if they are neither amusing nor vivid their common sense and their morality are excellent the other stories have no particular motive  boomellen a sketch of a semiidiot is pathetic so are  ah man the tale of a chinese vagabond and janey the history of a lame village girl they have the look of being almost literal reminiscences they are interesting if crude and there is much kindly human nature in them indeed were not the title and the preface there to remind us of unjustifiable pretensions it would be easy to give much more unstinted praise to these halfdozen stories,stories_contra

a 3 fivhe old friewls awal a young prinee by the author of the story of elizabeth smith elder and co our old friends have such very new faces that when we 1met with them in cornhill we should not have recognised them but for their titles externally and internally we now rfind them totally changed when we first knew them r they appeared in little books with paper covers procured not from the bookseller but at the toy shop afterwards we met with them printed in good bold type with grand illustrations rising from the page like the set scenes at a theatre now we are presented with them in an elegant volume sumptuously printed on toned paper handsomely bound with illustrations however which do no credit to all this luxuryfor to speak candidly they are simply hideous we are not prepared to say that our old friends are as much improved in reality as entertainers and e instructors as they are in outward appearance the fine  old fairy tales lose nearly all their poetry when reduced to fthe prosy level of everyday life and we feel convinced that the clever authoress would have given us far more i amusing stories had she trusted entirely to her own e imagination instead of trammelling herself for the purpose of producing a parody of our old favourites like the ltchildren of the present day who are apt so soon to lose h the charm of childhood and ceasing to be natural fancy li themselves young men and women these tales having lost their simplicity fail to excite much interest the new version is above the comprehension of children they 1 will not care for the love stories shorn of all their x wonders and yet their elders will be justified in voting the l tales as a whole too puerile to deserve their attention cinderella is the best she is still a little angel of patience i natural and charming and her surroundings are clever sketches of the life of today in  little red riding hood the grand tragedy is reduced to the level of a domestic drama what do we care about the dull life at fontainebleau which is in itself too bright and gay a little town too charming a retreat to be pitched upon ag the scene of such wearisome stupidity and then the moral which in the original is so clear that a baby can appreciate it is completely destroyed disobedience instead of meeting fwith condign punishment reigns triumphant certainly the wolf turns out to be no wolf at all but at worst a mere loupgarou but this is the authoresss fault and we cannot accept it as an excuse for rendering disobedience triumphant for proving that the young lady knows better than her papa and mamma a caution to them not to put the book into the hands of their daughters on the other hand jack the giantkiller gives us a fine moral leson of abuses remedied and oppression exposed by the disinterested efforts of an earnest activeminded man too energetic to fall into the jogtrot existence of ordinary clerical life and goaded to desperation by the apathy and coldness of his placid commonplace wife the story is more strange than agreeable the internal economy of an union workhouse does not present a pleasant picture for the fancy to dwell upon and if we attempt to console ourselves whilst reading of the cruelties and miseries by the reflection that it is only fiction we are soon unpleasantly reminded that such abuses and worse have been proved to have an actual existence and we cannot help fearing that they are still crying for redress in many a place where there is no jack to come to the rescue they are very correctly chosen as the type of the giant that devastates the lard the other two tales are the  sleeping beauty a description of the dull and vapid life led by many an english girl shut up in a dreary countryhouse with nothing to brak the monotony

friends of this fresh and delightful book are the stories of the sleeping beauty in the wood cinderella beauty and the beast little red riding hood and jack the giantkiller but original thought and delicate literary manipulation have so completely changed the faces of these ancient friends and have imbued them with so many qualities of fancy and feeling of head and heart that whilst it is sometimes difficult to recognise in their actors the favourite heroes and heroints of childhoods romance it is still more difficult to state precisely in a few words how far they resemble and in what respects they differ from the narratives of which they are transformations a general and sufficiently exact notion of the authors aim and method may however be given by saying that she presents the moral lessonsor rather what her humorous vision apprehends as the moral lessonsof the old stories in a series of papers which combining the properties of the moral essay with those of the modern domestic novel preserve just enough of the incidents and characters of the original tales to remind the reader how beauty was found sleeping in the wood and how all the other personages of the marvellous legends accomplished the parts assigned to them in their respective dramas the wood of q the nursery story is changed into a dreary j w mansion in a stagnant district of a dull a english

lulworths education  think there is nothing in the world so good for children as scoldings whippings dark cupboards and dry bread and water upon which they expect them to grow up into tall fat cheerful and amiable young men and women and a great many people think that for grownup young people the silence the chilliness the monotony and sadness of their own fading i  twilight days is all that is required mrs lui j r worth and maria bowley her companion j s cecilias late governess were quite of this j t opinion they themselves when they were  c little girls had been slapped snubbed locked  s up in closets thrust into bed at all sorts of hours flattened out on backboards set on high stools to play the piano for days together made to hem frills five or six weeks long and to learn immense pieces of poetry so that they had to stop at home all the afternoon but though mrs lulworth had grown up stupid suspicious narrowminded soured and overbearing and had married for an establishment and miss bowley her governesss daughter had   turned out nervous undecided melancholy and j  anxious and had never married at all yet they i determined tobringup ceciliaasthey themselves  had been brought up and sincerely thought t they could not do better so poor cecilia is i drilled and stultified by unsympathetic treatment till she becomes a torpid creature whose life is nothing more vivid than one long sleep until her prince in the shape of a jolly and slightly impudent cousin wakes her up with a startling kiss whereupon after the wont of children abruptly roused from their slumbers she bursts out acrying at the dazzling daylight  such a thing never happened in all my life before said cecilia  i know it is wrong to cry but reallyreally but cecilia never relapsed into her old unconsciousness of the beauty and brightness of life for cousin charlie married her and she turned out a happy wife and mother cinderella is retold excellently and with greater closeness to the original story than any of the three following tales the ella of the new is no less exemplary and charming than the cinderella of the old version and capital fun does the reproducer

stepsisters lisette and julia of whom we are told that they  grew up into two great tall fashionable bouncing young ladies they pierced their ears turned up their pigtails and dressed very elegantly the dreadful narrative of little red riding hood is converted into a fresh and abundantly humorous lovestory the heroine of which finds her wolf in a suitable lover who devours without destroying her after he has gratified his natural voraciousness by gobbling up all her grandmammas objections to their marriage but the history on which the most labour has been expended is the record of jack the giantkiller who in the service of the church militant as country curate and subse quently as country rector does valiant battle with ignorance and poverty and gigantic evils arising from the laws delay or the laws abuse humorous literature seldom gives us anything droller or more just in the way of kindly satire than the portraitures of miss moineaux and miss triquett who gather subscriptions to thc fund for presenting the rev john trevithic with a teapot and strainer when these zealous spinsters have pushed their way into the narrators lodgings at sandsea they both sat down very politely as people do who are utter strangers to you and about to ask you for money of course the sum required for jacks teapot was raised and when it was inspected by subscribers at the silversmiths in cockspur street  it was a very handsome teapot as ugly as other teapots of the florid order and the chief peculiarity was that a snake grasped by a clenched hand formed the handle arid a figure with bandages on its head was sitting on the melon on the lid this was intended to represent an invalid recovering from illness for the particulars of jacks brave doings in the cause of workhouse reform in the face of opposition at home and slanderous calumnies out of doors readers must refer to the text which in places reminds us of what was strongest and most pleasant in the  roundabout papers  five old friends and a young prince it was mr james hannay who said concerning the genius of thackeray one of the best of all the things which that large  five old friends aii a youon prince by the author of the story of elizabetb c with four fliustrations by fr erick walker london smith eidcr  co topic has called forth in the way of criticism nawely that the great novelists mind had within it an ioipluvitum of poetry which kept it fresh though it contained no mighty fountain of song a more felicitous metaphor does not often occur and it might be used in speaking of the writings of the author of the story of elizrbeth she cannot be called an unworldly writer she has the same kind of quiet sagacity as her illus trious father her common sense wvorks in her writings as his did in his with all the fmrce if not with all the dignity of fate she is essentially of her time and always writing with the quiet pronounced accent of an english gentlewoman of the latest social culture and the highest social opportunities and yet the impluvitun of poetry is there it would be an interesting task to trace the movement of the qualities of air thackerays genius feniinized if such an ugly word may be pardoned to us in that of the fascinating writer whose book is now before us the vein of poetry in the daughter dips more towards those facts and influences which we are accustomed to sum up under the word nature than it did in the father it seems to us though the point is no doubt an open one that the cord of common sense is drawn tighter in her writings than in his not only weak minds but minds with a certain kind of force in them may occasionally feel as if the blood was ready to spurt under the constriction mr thackeray himself often made his readers or some of them feel like that in reading the writings of his daughter the same class of readers feel it none the less because her manner is so quiet again mr thackeray always impressed his readers as being distinctly qf the world he painted so wonderfullyyou could guess his position culture and social environment and it appears to us that as was to be expected you can do this with still more certainty in the case of the lady it may seem a necessary thing in the nature of the case that an english gentlewoman should write like one but except as to points of abstinence it is not so a good book does not necessarily give you the remotest hint of its authors social status or training a book of george eliots does not the best of mrs gaskells books do not all mr trollopes do and we are quite sure that the fact where it exists tends to limit an authors audience the bulk of mankind who are outside of the circle of a certain social culturewe were going to say cultfeel puzzled when its existence appears to be assumed as the necessary point on which to rest the imaginative lever one quality which mr thackeray possessed in a high degree that of the poetic naivetgis possessed in certainly not a less degree by the author of the story of eiizabeth it must be called a high quality for though its use on any large scale implies a certain humorous selfconsciousness it is distinctly affiliated to the simplicity of genius and no writer ever showed it consciously in his works who had it not in so great a degree that it also showed itself unconsciously in his life in the very beautiful stories now before us we have at the basis of the work the same kind of faculty as that which produced  prince giglio and prince bulbo  but while the hypo thesis on which the work is supposed to restnamely the natural origination and indestructibility of may we say fairyismmight prepare you to expect that large licence of fancy would be taken there is none taken at the same time the glamour or delicate threat of glamour is so well kept hanging over the readers head that he would not be surprised at the most im probable thing in the world let us suppose that we had all been accustomed to hear fairy tales recited or played by a fairyfied storyteller in a peculiar voice with peculiar gestures and with peculiar music between the acts then let us suppose somebody comes to us and adopting or gliding into the voice and maniere d6tre of the fairyfied reciter and repeating the music exactly proceeds to tell us stories of everyday life that is exactly what the author of these tales does and we feel ready to be tripped up at any moment by a touch of the old wand though the scene is laid in sussex or in brompton we are decidedly of opinion that the introduction with its theory of the natural indestructibility of the fairy tale is a mistake the effect would have been complete without this uncovering of the imaginative basis of the work or if not it might with a little labour have been made so that readers of the

sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in such a state as to

old kensington old kensington by miss tbackeray smitb elder and co miss thackerays first noveiif we may leave out of account the admirable  story of elizabeth that was her prentice work and may speak of  the village on the cliff  as her first finished novelwas almost too good for her later reputation that charming book could not easily be equalled and as the public expects each new book to be better than any that prneded it  old kenuing wu disappoint some of its readers we confess that it has given us some disappointment yet it is a captal moel and something more than a novel her fathers gentlesatire has been inherited by miss thackeray in a gentler but not lees incisive form and with it is joined an ear nestnees of purpose that may not be stronger than that which appears in  vanity fair and  the newoomes but which perhaps through the absence of other qualities is more apparent we are nob sure that  old kensington is not more like her fathers work than anything else that miss thackeray has published and it is possible that that resemblance is the main cause of any disappointment we may have felt in reading the story miss thackeray wants nothing more than a development of that individuality of genius that shows itself in  the village on the cliff  to place her in the foremost rank of the novelists of the day and to secure for her books an honourable rank among the classics of the future we feel however as if we were hypercritical in saying anything at all to her disparagement when we remember how charmingly she has told for us the story of the dolly who is the heroine of old kensington dolly is the nickname for dorothea and this new study from the life of today is not unworthy to rank with the dorothea of the greatest of all our novelists how widely miss thackerays dorothea differs from george eliots dorothea is shown in the fact that all her best friends call her dolly the dorothea of  middlemarch loveable as she is could never have obtained so affectionate a nickname she is of a much more exalted temperament and in her own way is an inimitable type of a fair number of the most refined women in this commonplace age but the dorothea of  old kensington if more conventional is certainly not less charming and the more carefully we trace her history the better we shall understand how much of patient heroinisma different thing from heroismis to be found among those in whom we should least expect to find it there are two great classes of womenthose who minister and those who are taken care of by others and the born caretakers and workers are apt to chafe in early life before people will recognise their right to do something is wrong tempers go wrong hearts beat passionately boil over ache for nothing at all they want to comfort people to live to love to come and go to feel they are at work it may be wholesome discipline for such people to live in a kingdom of education of shadows and rules they may practice their selfdenial on the keys of the piano they may translate their hearts interest into german exercises and back into english again but that is poor work in those sentences miss thackeray sums up we suppose the main thought that she wishes to illustrate in her history of dolly vanborough and if her philosophy is not very profound it is true as far as it goes and dollys history illustrates it very admirably it extends from her babyhood to her marriage and the main part of it shows how her sensitive nature is torn during her lovemaking with a selfish prig who is quite unworthy of her love and how it is barely healed by the devotion of the true friend who has worshipped her all along but who only wins her love after she has been cast off by her first and longcherished lover miss thackerays men are not so skilfully drawn as her women but there is considerable discrimination in the portrayal of the selfish robert henley and the unselfish frank raban while george vanborough will serve as a favourable specimen of those stagy young men who sow their wild oats because they are so well supplied with stores  it  ik  3  l  of healthy grain and who die off just when the time nas come for the healthy grain to bear fruit better drawn than all the boys and men however is rhoda dorothea vanboroughs friend who serves as a foil to her and also as an exemplification of that profound truth which miss thackeray is so anxious to preach that  to be good is such a tremendous piece of luck it is not rhodas lack to be good all the early circumstances of her life are against it therefore every year adds a new crust of selfishness to her and from a little girl whom one might suppose altogether meet for the kingdom of heaven she grows to be very nearly another becky sharp i unim we had space in which to write a long essay on this tiorol and on the characteristics of all miss thackerays works it would be idle for us to attempt a complete exminxtion of her merits as a novelist chief among these perhaps are her skill in weaving a natural and attractive tale out of very commonplace materials and the quiet humour with which she tells it there is more than humourwit of the highest sortin some of her work and this shows itself in many subtle ways we are told for instance how when dollys first lover goes away to india she lives on the thought that after a stiff parting he had come back and given her a last embrace  he loved her she thought to herself or he would never have come back to her and if he loved her the parting had lost its sting twelve chapters later when the lover has returned to europe he lets out that he had gone back on that memorable day not for the last embrace but for his greatcoat  one wants all ones wraps in the sunny mediterranean i was glad of it afterwards i had just time to

throughout painted with a true feeling for soft bright colour and showing now and then a subtle accuracy of outline in the detail as a pctre or a series of pictures the work leaves nothing to be desired no one knows better than wmis thackeray how to set her characters amongst scenery which at once reflects and illustrates their passing mood to associate an effect of light a picturesque foreground a quiet distance or an aspect of the sky with a moment of sentiment impulse or selfquestioning and so to represent the leser agitations of human life as sharing some of the tranquil dignity of nature her descriptions are not only true but recognisably true and there is so much refined beauty in the several parts of the stary that it is almost rasable to complain of defect in the whole but direct descriptions and indirect appeals to the eye of the imagination however lifelike and vivid give but an imperfect account of action and character they show the results not the gradual working development and reciprocal infiuence of the two elements the very ingenuity with which the plot is con cted so as to make the characters finally display themselves in their true light jars upon us as a cmmoner kind of ment than the writer ought to allow herself to cultivate wills and deaths timed so as to fall at cross purposes with the testators intention are much more easily invented than the processes by which the heroine dolly might gradually and naturally awake from her innocent and almost natural mistake in the choice of a hero but such incidents add nothing to the interest felt in her fortunes while they look as if the author mistrusted the coheence and apparent reality of her own creations creation indeed is not the idea which naturally suggests itself in wis thackeays works we seem always to be looking at a sketch from nature not at nature herself and the lusion which even at this secondary stage is sueient to produce a really artistic effect is disturbed by the introduction of ordinary mechanical devices for bringing too plainly preesined marriages to pass the sympathetic insight of a good sketch is better than the unsisfing completees of a 4compositon landscape but in  old kensington the bits of good sketching do not blend into one original whole we miss in consequence that eion of solid substance and reality behind the somewhat shadowy pesnlt q

a princess of thule a princess of thule by william black third edition il three volumes macmillan whether ancient poets when they talk of  ultima thule mean iceland the mainland of the shetlands or another northern locality seems doubtful still more diffi cult it would be to define the realm of the lovesick king of thule in  faust with mr black the felicitous title of whose last novel has evidently been suggested by goethes ballad thule means a little islet in loch roag in the immediate vicinity of lewis the most northern of the hebrides sheila the heroine daughter to mr mekenzie familiarly called the king of borva is wooed and wedded by mr lavender a london artist and the greater part of the novel is taken up by her adventures in her new southern home the story of a child of nature being suddenly transferred into the blazing eentre of civilisation is nct unprecedented in truth or fiction the changes of aspect which a character deprived in this way of its proper foil offers to the eye of the world and particularly to that of an infatuated and often alas  too soon disappointed lover are indeed too striking not to attract the inquiring attenticn of the psychological observer readers of goethes autobiography cannot but remember with sympathetic pity for both parties the irrepressible feeling of incongruity with which the lively graces of the sebenbeim beauty struck the sensitive poet in a strasburg drawingroom of more modern treatments of a similar subject we may mention a novel by berthold auerbach the plot of which shows a faint similarity with mr blacks story and les amants a powerful though repulsive work by m hector malot in both these the result is tragic and ends in the more or less thorough destruction of the illmatched couples mir black has approached the problem from a different side ihe wants to show that a trulygreat nature will evince its intrinsic value even under the most un favourable circumstances and therefore he does not make the inevitable breach between the heroine and her husband irremediable it on the contrary turns out to have the most favourable consequences causing the katharsis of the worldlyminded mr lavender and resulting ultimately in the happy reunion of the lovers we fully admit the psychological truth and beauty of this solution but must regret at the same time the almost trivial manner in which the catastrophe is brought about the dleut of sheila in a london drawingroom is not as successful as her husband had expected it would be society is willing to acknowledige her claims to personal beauty but cannot see in her the sublime princess of the north as which she at first appeared to the romantic fancy of her enchanted lover in consequence he occasionally neglects her and i even begins a slight and as it afterwards turns out very innocent flirtation with a fascinating american widow sheila feels thoroughly discontented with her situation she is yearning for her beloved north and in a fit of nostalgy she contrives to adorn her husbands smokingroom with shells and bell heather in exactly the same manner as her i fathers parlour in borvabost so as to awaken old remniniscences and hint at the same time at a former promise to live part of the year in the western isles a cousin of hers half confidante half servant who has just arrived on a visit is also to act on the same occasion but unfortunately her husband has invited some grand friends for luncheon that day tile american beauty amongst them and when in consequence he refuses in rather a rough manner to let the scotch peasant girl partake of the feast the highminded princess of the north calmly walks into the kitchen orders luncheon for her husbands guests and after that takes the nearest fourwheel cab and drives with her country cousin to a queer old aunt of her husbands who quotes marcus aurelius and has her food weighed out to her for sanitary reasons here she lies hidden for some time i refusing steadfastly to return to her husband even passing him in the street without speaking the cause or at least the occasion of this crisis we think utterly inadequate and unwarrantable from a psychological point of view it may happen in the course of nature that young married people before their individualities are blended by mutual forbearance begin by quarrelling about trifles but then such qutvrlles vpaiour blow over as quickly as they arise but that a highminded and loving wife such as sheila is described should in this way desert her home and duty is utterly incredible the consequences of these rash steps ate however beneficial in more than one respect mr lavender who hitherto has considered his art more in the light of an amusement now makes an effort he leaves london for the wild scenery of jura and shows his repentance by means of honest and successful work another advantage of the catastrophe is the removal of the story from london the gloing de scriptions of northern nature in its wildness and beauty forui a striking contrast to the sketchy manner in which the heroines london life is delineated particularly the strange effects of arctic sunsets are

the dominion of dreams one of miss macleods new stories tells how a certain shepherd wandering at night over a lonely marshland sees a piper piping among a flock of sheep he had a black feather in his bonnet and black streamers from his pipes and his music was now full of mockery and now full of melancholy and when the shepherd tried to go towards him he seemed always as far off as ever the shepherd stood to listen and suddenly he found that the piper was quite close and that what he had thought sheep were but shadows of all shapes and sizes they were and he did not know hosv he knew this the shadows of all the piper had seen that daythe shadows of trees and plants and cattle and of a dead man in a corrie and of the shepherd himself as he had lost it an hour ago at the set of the sun being terrified and angry because he was terrified he tried to seize the piper with his hands and fell against a rock striking his head and as he fell he saw the shadows change to a flock of curlews and fly away presently he awoke out of a swoon and began wandering here and there looking for the curlew that had been his shadow until being at last worn out he lay down and slept and as he slept the piper came but looking different for now he had long black hair and stood beside him and took tup the shadow of a reed and played upon it a curlew came nearer and nearer and the piper played it back into a shadow and played the shadow into the mind of the shepherd when day had come the shepherd awoke and gave 1 three cries of the curlew and began to wander back aimlessly in the way he had come people explained his madness by saying that the dark fool the amadan dhu had touched him i give this story which loses much of its mystery in my bare chronicle because it is easier to unwind it than to unwind her more complicated stories and i am anxious to discover the thoughts about which her art is wound other writers are busy with the way men and women act in sorrow or in joy but miss macleod has rediscovered the art of the mythmakers and gives a visible shape to joys ald sorrows and makes them seem realities and men and women illusions it was minds like hers that created aphrodite out of love and the foam of the sea and prometheus out of human thought and its likeness to leaping fire we understand in some dim way that her amadan dhu is some halfinspired madness such as marked men out in early times for a terrified worship and that the shadows that  the dominion of dreams ey fiona macleod 6s a constable and co gather about him like sheep are but our own memories the things that make us ourselves and bind us to the world in some peaceful mood and that the shadows changed into curlews are our memories in some wilder mood and because the links of resemblance are subtle and the full meaning beyond our reach we understand with our emotions rather than with our reason and the story is not allegorybut symbolism and not prose but poetry swedenborg and jacob boehme have begun to cast off the manners of the schools and to talk the fairy tales of children and from this union of the lofty with the simple religious myth has been reborn a change in thought in the world makes us understand that we are not walled up within our immediate senses but bound one to another and to some greater life by a secret communion of thought and emotion that can in a moment fling up into the waking mind some dream or vision of a faroff friend and of his circumstance or of a hidden and consoling loveliness  and at once a kind of literature which passed away with the ancient world and its witchcraft begins to arise in every european country this literature has a power over strange effects for it can trust itself to dim emotions of beauty as no literature can which believes its revelation comes out of the waking mind one of these stories tells of eoan and finola whose house is  on a sunswept mound in the wood i long ago he had eaten mistletoe berries in moonshine and had not waked again finola loving him more than life had changed herself into the white stillness of sleep and was a dream in his mind and lay quiet and glad and at rest and in another we are told of aevgrain the daughter of deirdre  then her white hands moved like swans through the shadowy flood that was her hair and she put sleep from her every kind of inspiration has its besetting faults and perhaps because those who are at the beginning of movements have no models and no traditional restraints miss macleod has faults enough to ruin an ordinary writer her sarch for dim resemblances sometimes brings her beyond the borders of coherence and she has a way of using literary words when the right words are the words of daily speech that often makes some beautiful invention seem unreal there is scarcely a story that would not be the better for the crossing out of many words before her shepherd sees the dark fool he hears the crying of sheep and it is called a ilamentable melancholy sound like children crying in some forlorn place how much better this would have been without  lamentable and with 1 lonely  or the like instead of  forlorn  at another place she spoils a beautiful old gaelic saying that calls the cry of the wind and the cry of the wave and the cry of the curlew the three oldest cries in the world by calling them  the three lamentable elder voices of the world the bent of nature that makes her turn from circumstance and personalities to symbols and personifications may perhaps leave her liable to an obession from certain emotional words which have for her a kind of symbolic meaning but her love of old tales should tell her that the great mysteries are best told in the simpler words w b yeats,stories_contra

american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual

red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the importance of possessing so interesting a legend to communicate   and such is also the name they give to his vessel because no mau who has put foot on board her has over come bael to say that she has a bettor or a worse  that is no honest mariner or lucky voyager the ship i of though size of a kings sloop they scv and of like equipments and form  but she ha miraculously escaped from the hands of many a gallant

opinions differ some say yes some say no but 1 am well acquainted with a man who travelled a week in company with a mariner who passed within a hundred feet of her in a gale of wind lucky it was for thom that the hand of the lord was felt so powerfully on the deep and that though hover had enough to do to keep his own ship from foundering the acquaintance of my friend had a good view of both vessel and captain therefore in perfect safety isle said that the pirate was a man maybe half as big again as the tall preacher over on the main with hair of the colour of the sun in a fog and eyes that no man would like to look upon a second time he saw him as plainly as 1 see you  for the knave stood in the rigging of his ship beckoning with a hand as big as a coatflap for though honest trader to keep off in order that though two vessels might not do one another damage by coming foul   he was a bold mariner that trader to go so nigh such n merciless rogue  1 warrant you lardon it was desperately against his will but it was on a night so dark   dark interrupted the other  by what contrivance then did he manage to see so well   no man can say answered the tailor  but so he did just in the manner and the very things 1 have named to you more than that ho took good note of the vessel that he might know her if chance or providence should over happen to throw her again into his way she was a long black ship lying low in the water like a snake in the grass with a desperate wicked look and altogether of dishonest dimensions then every body says that she appears to sail faster than the clouds above seeming to care little which way the wind blows and that no oatt is u jot safer fresher speed than her honesty according to all that 1 have heard she is something such a craft as yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy upon the motions of the ked rover who with a facility only to he met with in romance becomes acquainted with our hero anti is at once appointed to the first lieutenancy of the pirateship the descriptive portions of the work are without exception good and we quote the following picture of the cabin of the lied rover   the apartment in which our adventurer now found himself atrbrded no bad illustration of the character of its occupant in its form and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements  but in ils furniture anti equipments it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation the lamp which swung from the upper deck was of solid silver and though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity there was that in its shape and ornaments which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character massive candlesticks of the same precious metal and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation were on a venerable tible whose mahogany was glittering with the polish ol hail a century and whose gilded claws anti carved supporters bespoke au original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship a conch covered with cut velvet stood along the transom  while a divan of blue silk lay against the bulkhead oppoite inanifesin by its fashion its materials and its piles of pillows that even asia had been made to contribute to tue ease of its luxurious owner in addition to these prominent articles there were cut glass mirrors plate and even hangings each of which by something peculiar in il fashion or materials bespoke au origin iliiterent 1roai that of ils neighbour in short splendour and elegance seemed to have been mach more consulted than propriety or conformity in taste in the selection ol most of those articles which had been oddly enough made to contribute to the caprice or to cue comfort of their siiguia possessor  lu the midst of this medley of wealth rntl luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt is all in vain however the ship is on the point of sailing when most opportunely the captain breaks his leg and wilder is without loss of time nay on a live minutes intid uiatiou ol the tact installed in thu command the royal caroline so she is named sails from the bay whilst all the exertions of the new captain are employed to carry her out of the course of the rover isle fails of course  the pirate pursues him  a storm ensues the royal caroline is dismantled reduced to a total wreck and at length roes down while wilder and the ladies escape in the launch and are safely received on board

rover encounters the british vessel to which wilder is attached goes on board in disguiseand discovers his treachery hut instead however of executing him as a traitor he dismisses him and his friends

thc story of kennett by bayard taylor new york putnam together with the excitements of a lovestory the characters and incidents of which are in perfect harmony with the period and scenes selected for delineation mr bayard taylors new volume presents the reader with a carefully exact and in some places microscopic picture of the rural life of pennsylvania at the close of the last century hence thc book has claims upon the attention of persons who under ordinary circumstances care but little for the inventions of romantic art it may not however be inferred that the story of kennett is chiefly noticeable for it3 descriptions of an almost obsolete state of society the tale is rich in interest having a very unusual plot for its framework and comprising amongst its details many delicate illustrations of character there was small need for the author to intimate in his preface that his pages were the record of local traditions and personal observations concerning men and places familiar to the residents of a district about which he observes  the country life of our part of pennsylvania retains more elements of its english origin than that of new englaud or virginia until within a few years the conservative influence of the quakers was so powerful that it continued to shape the habits even of communities whose religious sentiment it failed to reach unaided by this confession the tone and humour no less than the personages of the story indicate with sufficient clearness the sources from which the author drew his knowledge as well as the circumstances under which it was obtained ample evidence of his conscientious adherence to facts is found in the homely bluntness of the farmers who are the principal male actors of the drama the outspoken frankness of their women and the sedate composure of the quakers whose sober costumes and quiet tastes contrast strongly with the passions and crimes from which the story derives the larger part of its action and dramatic force in more than one place indeed the author has sacrificed effect to literal truth and would have done better had he trusted more to his imagination and less to memory on the other hand there are passages where facts and fancy are combined with perfect judgment and to admirable purposeof which especially felicitous parts none is better than the account of martha deanes wedding at the qvakerly hilarious entertainment which followed that ceremony miss lavender one of the best creations of the story  rocking her head to the peculiar lilt of the words sang the following quaint ditty

such unrestrained merriment under his roof so the doctor gives the signal for dispersion and the friends bid the bride good night in the last page of the story  the story of kennett a tale of pennsylvania by bayard taylor 2 i vols low son  marston mr bayard taylor as was sir walter scott is both a poet and a novelist like the author of waverley too the author of  the story of kennett is a landowner and a country gentleman the new york papers amongst theil recent interesting bits of literary gossip have told us that the author who has been spending the winter in new york returned recently to his farm at kennet square chester county pennsylvania having first seen his novel reach its eighth thousand and his new poem  the picture of st john a story of artlife in italy in the printers hands with tastes and pursuits kindred to those of washington irving and nathaniel hawthorne and with the same strong love of the natural beauties of his native country which gives fascination to the pages of james fenimore cooper mr bayard taylor here furnishes us with a picture of simple unstrained matteroffact everyday life placed among the beautiful hills and charming valleys round about his own country home with every feature of which he claims the familiarity of an old acquaintance and which he from the beginning to the end of the book makes the common property of the reader with himself the traditions and habits of the people among whom the greater part of his life has been passed the rustic dwellers and the legends of the country in themselves but homespun materials for a work of fiction in his hands have all the charm of novelty with which goldsmith the greatest master of the school of wthich mr taylor is an advanced pupil invested the everyday life of the family of the primroses till in their way the story of kennett and the vicar of wakefield may be regarded as true pictures of the simple manners and customs of rural england and america at the date in which the action of either tale is placed indeed mr taylor assures us himself that every custom he has described is true to the time though some of them are now obsolete that he has used no peculiar word or phrase of the common dialect of the country which he has not himself heard  and further that he owes the chief incidents of the last chapter given to him on her deathbed to i the dear and noble woman whose character not the circumstances of her life he has endeavoured to reproduce in that of martha deane at a glance it becomes evident that some of the characters are but photographs reproduced it is true with all the cunning of a master of the art this is the case with sandy flash the freebooter and highwayman who lives in the bush  with deb smith a wandering sort of meg merrilies diluted  with joe and jake fairthorn two little impish urchins up to all kind of mad pranks  but more particularly with roger a noble horse next to his master gilbert potter the hero of one of the most graphic scenes in the book speaking of these to his neighbours to whom he dedicates the story of kennett the author introduces them as characters which many of them will be sure to recognize admitting that truth and fiction are so carefully woven together in the story that they will sometimes be at a loss to disentangle them  the country life of our part of pennsyl vania he adds retains more elements of its english origin than that of new england or virginia until within a few years the conservative influence of the quakers was so powerful that it continued to shape the habits even of communities whose religious sentiments it failed to reach hence whatever might be selected as incorrect of american life in its broader sense in these pages is nevertheless locally true this is the great charm of the book and gives to it a freshness which in these days when fiction prefers to deal with abnormal characters and psychological problems more or less morbid makes the representation of the elements of life in a simple healthy pastoral community a source of true enjoyment the date of the tale is the close of the last century the infancy of the rising power of the united states  but beyond the bare mention of kennett square itself occupying the ground of a battlefield and the turning up of a dead hessian foi deb smith that event is made to add no interest to the narrative the whole interest indeed is centred round the leading characters mary potter and her son gilbert martha dean and her father a dandy quaker doctor  the old miser barton and his son alfred a wouldbe english squire  fortune or sandy flash as he proves to be a type of the robin hood and rob roy freebooter and his deb smith and betsy lavender an unfledged type of mrs poyser an old maid full of wise saws and wondrous sentences of the subordinate characters two only need be mentioned a second pair of lovers mark dean and sally fairthorn mr taylor shows the good sense of de foe by dropping his minor characters just at the right time so as not to be missed by the reader of this small community gilbert potter who bears his mothers maiden name is the hero and martha deane a lifelike impersonation as true to nature as if she had been sketched by george eliot is the heroine of course the stumblingblock in the way of the lovers is the poverty of gilbert and the slur upon his name of the latter he had outwardly made but small account letting it rankle without murmur in his own breast till he finds himself in love with martha deane but then he breaks the matter to his mother who in an agony of grief exclaims ten years and you believed it all that time   a lie  a lie  you are my son horn in lawful wedlock  in fact the mother was hound by an oath not to reveal the fathers name till after the death of her husbands father as the marriage had been a clandestine one contracted at a moment when the old man was supposed to be approaching his end bound by this oath mary potter continues for twentyfive years to live under the implied disgrace hut a strong religious feeling supports her for she sees in all only the finger of god and waits his good time to release her and so keeps the secret to herself every one interested speculates upon the probable paternity of gilbert who himself as there is a mystery attached to the dean family at first finds a solution to the enigma in the supposition that dr dean is his father this is doubly painful  he loves martha deane and then she would be his halfsister and the stain of illegitimacy would be transferred from himself to her he establishes satisfactorily that such is not the case but perhaps it is the doctors brother to whom he owes his birth that conjecture also is dismissed and his suspicions centre upon sandy flash that worthy at last gets into trouble and is hanged for his crimes previous to his execution gilbert potter visits him  sandy  gilbert cried desperately  answer this one questiondont go out of the world with a false word in your mouth  you are not my father  the highwaymans answer is satisfactory gilbert is not his son much of the interest of the second volume is kept up by gilberts search for a father and the denouement is only brought about at the close of the volume in a manner natural  enough in itself but to reveal which would spoil the readers pleasure so we leave it untold it will be seen that the plot is secondary mr bayard taylor meant to give us a picture of quaker life in pennsylvania some eighty years ago that he lias succeeded is shown by the great and merited success of  the story of kennet in america it is no small praise for a writer of fiction to have produced a tale of national manners and customs so truthful and at the same time possessing all the novelty of a phase of life but imperfectly known to the great bulk of iiis readers great as the popularity of the book has been in america we predict that its popularity with us will be no less sure and lasting  the story of kennett new novels by bayard taylor 2 vols low  co strictly speaking there is not much story in mr bayard taylors new book but there is abundance of interest our curiosity is not much excited by the attempt at making a mystery of the heros birth and his mothers marriage nor is it gratified when the mystery is solved it is rather a fault in art to reward the heros good qualities by giving him a father whom he must despise but putting the plot aside as somewhat superfluous there is no lack of incident unconnected with the plot or of character independent of it the scene is laid in the pennsylvanian township of kennett and the hero is gilbert potter a young farmer whose acquaintance we make while out hunting others whom we meet at the same time are alfred barton who tries to look like a gentleman but is betrayed by ftomething coarse and vulgar in his nature which exhales like a powerful odour through the assumed shell and a jolly blackwhiskered man who calls himself fortune but who suddenly pulls off his whiskers in a dark wood and shows a closecropped head of red hair wicked eyes and shining teeth while he proclaims himself as the famous highwayman sandy flash so long as sandy flash is alive robbing and defying capture the story is exciting enough sandy is a sort of pennsylvanian bobin hood taking only from the rich and giving to the poor he has always had a spite against barton which is not explained and a partiality for gilbert potter which seems at first to suggest an explanation of the mystery but sandy does violence to this theory by robbing gilbert himselfand with this robber the highwaymans luck for lakes hiro he is betrayed by an accomplice in a scene reminding us a little of dirk hatteraick and meg merrilie and though gilbert potters money is returned to him enabling him to pay off a mortgage on his farm the highwaymans capture does not otherwise affect the course of the story much of the population of kennett is quaker and we can vouch for the fidelity of mr bayard taylors portraits of quakers at meeting or in their own houses dr deane the father of the heroine is one of the chief characters and the scenes between him and  oldman barton the father of alfred barton are some of the best parts of the book oldman barton comes nearer to the type of a miser than even harpagon he has had a paralytic stroke and is confined to a chair but he continues to draw the strictest half profits from the farm managed by his son and his favourite station is where he can watch his daughter cooking and  measure with his eye every bit of lard she put in the fryingpan and every spoonful of molasses that entered into the composition of her pies dr dean and he want to get up a match between martha dean and alfred barton and the old man is so excited by talking it over his eyes twinkled so under their puffy lids the flabby folds in which his mouth terminated worked so curiouslylike those of a bellows where they run together towards the nozzleand the two movable fingers on each hand opened and shut with such a menacing clutching motionthat for one moment the doctor felt a chill uncanny creep run over his nerves how vivid this is yet there are other bits of description equally good sandy flashs robbery of gubert potter with the brave way in which gilberts horse faces the highwayman and prepares to charge and gilberts escape from drowning through the agency of the same noble horse are admirable pictures the side of american life which is presented to us in the book is sufficiently novel to give us an interest even if such pictures were wanting but with their aid mr bayard taylor has written a story that will please his fellowcountrymen by its associations and strangers by its intrinsic merit,stories_contra

  the sun of thc czar an historical romance histonical romances uy james ji uranam narper isrotners the writer of  the son of the czar a lady if we mistake not attempts to relate the miserable career of alexis the son of peter the great probably this episode is too revolting to be capable of artistic treatment in a romance or on the boards the tsarevitch take him at his best was a poor cowardly knave who showed his illustrious father that he was bent upon upsetting all his plans and reducing to a nullity the whole purpose of his life peter had something of the oriental despot in his nature and cared little whom he struck down if he were an obstacle in his path the stupid boyhimself full of brutal instincts as he showed by his treatment of his wifewas doomed to perish although perhaps the exact manner of his death will never be known the writer has drawn an ideal portrait of peter making him habitually use highflown rhetoric whereas we know from history that he was a man of few words and of almost brutal frankness the same is the case with the uneducated catherine his wife who is here made to talk with the sententiousness of though mistress of a boardingschool the poor princess charlotte of wolfenbiittel is dragged in and made an archduchess a title to which she had no claim whatever the adventures of alexis in his flight both to vienna and naples aro described at length the miserable fate of his finnish mistress euphrosyne furnishes some pages of horrors but fortunately there is no historical warrant for believing that she met with her death at the hands of her own brother according to one story she lived thirty years after her lovers death generally speaking we think that the writer has not enough acquaintance with russian customs and modes of thought how would it be possible for alexis to take interest in the latin churches which he saw in his travels and to believe in st januarius the writer has clearly never heard of the russian views on the latin heresy again alexis is often spoken of as a handsome young man whereas he was very much the reverse as a glance at his portraits would show he is introduced as reading  the imitation of christ a book of devotion unknown to the orthodox  we find stained  glass windows in russian churches  and the ignorant muscovites of that time are described as being well acquainted with what happened in the west and having western ideas generally the word teran from though greek ttpefiva the womans part of the house in ancient russia is in several passages treated as if it were identical in meaning with a harem to mention minor details we constantly find the chief actors in the story drinking champagne we should imagine that at that time it was a wine practically unknown in russia in no account of peter the great do we find him spoken of as drinking it in the anecdotes told of him it is hungarian wine that is mentioned so also the use of coffee is made far too common the beverage had only come into vogue at the end of the previous century and is very little mentioned in russian books of the time then we have the unusual expression emperor of the romans  for the german emperor we have heard of the king of the romans but hardly of the emperor except in a latin form the spelling of the russian names seems to show that the writer is not acquainted with the russian language thus what are we to say of  czeremetov for sheremetiov  and how could maranoff be a russian baron a title unknown in the country at that time but it would be useless to pursue these minutia further if we allow the writer of an historical novel to modify the facts a little for his convenience as scott did we cannot pardon him for being ignorant of though manners of the time and of the local colour there are several chapters in john gilbert yeoman by mr r g soans warne  co that place the book above the average of fiction in the class to which it belongs as a romance of the commonwealth it gives a vivid and often interesting account of rural life in sussex with occasional excursions to the metropolis the dramatis per some include fewer characters known to history than is usual in such works cromwell appears on the stage towards the end of though book and there is an occasional glimpse of lady claypole the writer borders on the ridiculous when cromwell writes to the hero  the only impediment to your marriage being done away with i doubt not but that you will find an early date for the consummation thereof and still more quaintly adds at which by your leave i would fain be present the proposition might involve a nice question of delicacy in other respects the book is written with caro and rarely without skill in the gown and the man by prester st george digby long  coa story of the

the hearts highway by mary e wilkins murraythis is a romance of virginia in the year 1682 told in the first person by the hero one starts upon such a story with misgivings but miss wilkins is to be congratulated on a striking success she has mastered the difficulty of writing in an artificial style so that her book is not merely in modern prose ornamented with turns of phrase imitated from the literature of the end of the seventeenth century but is written in an acquired language throughout showing very little signs of the labour and itudy which must have been given to the task one can read it with ease and with pleasure and the strain of writing in a studied style so far from hampering the authors invention seems to have spurred her imagination if one may express an individual preference  the hearts highway  may be said to be the most interesting of miss wilkinss books it seems to carry the reader along more rapidly than her new england stories and ones attention is not extorted but given readily one forgets to be critical in the interest of the story but here and there an expression catches ones eye possibly miss wilkins may have authority for the disagreeable split infinitive in 1682 but the phrase to fairly overreach p 5 had better have been altered a suffolk man would hardly have talked of suffolkshire it may bo doubted whether sportsmen were accustomed to shoot hying birds in 1682 and whether it would have been possible to take high honours at cambridge a few years earlier that the narrator should call his neighbours place sometimes cavendish hall aud sometimes cavendish court is a trifling blemish the incidents of fighting during the wars between the king and the parliament in the seventeenth century are somewhat loosely put together in a romance entitled the dogs f war by edgar pickering warne  co the story has been told very often especially of late and it has become hard to discover new features however the book before us is by no means without its merits and moat of the technicalities incident to seventeenthcentury life have been observed though not always used to the best advantage the narrative is again in the first person and where a statement is made which at the moment was hardly likely to be known to the narrator there is a footnote saying that the facts were ascertained afterwards it is satisfactory to rind that no attempt is made to explain why the story is written and the customary excuse that i he narrator thinks his children may like to read of his adventures is omitted the book is not one which will take a foremost place among the historical romances of the time but it is an honest and pleasing effort in fiction we ought perhaps to enter a caveat with regard to the chronology of the first chapterit is somewhat difficult to follow mr j bloundelleburton goes back a hundred and eighty years to the paris of 1719 for the epoch and the setting of servants of sinmethuen k co his hero is a refugee english jacobite clarges in love with a beautiful french girl lure vauxcelles lure is to marry the due dsparre a hotblooded rone of fifty whom she hates devoutly though without returning the englishmans love these and a vengeful marquise whom the duke had offended are the principal actors in a romance of crowded incident and passion in which the author has heaped up all the sensations which it was possible for him to devise amongst them he presents a picture of marseilles devastated by i he plague and makes it the background of a moving human drama at eaux st fer he introduces crebillon who assists madame la marquise to get up a little play for the special behoof of desparre crushing him dramatically by the revelation of a terrible secret bound up with his past life the subsequent story of the villainous duke is affecting enough mr bloundelleburton can be pathetic when he does not make too much of mere sensation his romance is full of movement and no doubt the majority of readers will find it highly attractive the blessing of esau by frank savile sampson low  co is a romance of the days of prince eugene the campaign of that great general against the turks affords a young imperialist officer the opportunity of discovering his name and birthright of which he had been kept in ignorance and of becoming acquainted with his gallant halfbrother and a bewitching servian maid who of course becomes his bride there is plenty of action in the story which is on the whole well told though the author shows some symptoms of the vice of wordtorturing  novel notes the hearrs highway by m e wilkins 69 murray for once miss wilkins has deserted new england to give us a charming story of old virginia it is fresh and vigorous in style and the end is as ingenious as it is novel the plot is good all through and if the hero is a little too faultless the heroines fascination more than atones for him so much in bare justice to miss wilkinsnow for a grumble good as the book is it might have been written by halfadozen other people we miss the delicacy and the humour which marked miss wilkins earlier work she has made new england so peculiarly her own that we regret this excursion into other realms fearing that the success of this venture may encourage her to repeat it in  the hearts highway  miss wilkins has shown how successfully she can write in this robuster vein

tryphena in love surely dialect in fiction like onion in a salad is best when it lurks halfsuspected yet animates the whole not when it intrudes its plebeian presence to the destruction of more subtle flavours nor unless we chance to be philologists are we chiefly concerned that it be pedantically exact indeed the truer impression is more often given by a somewhat conventional vocabulary such as mr chevalier permitted his costers to employ than by a phonographically accurate record mr raymond never a noticeable offender in this way has in this book been still more reticent in obtruding nonfamiliar idioms his dialect subtly pervades the whole storyin the impersonal passages as well as those uttered directly by the chief actors yet you are never driven to a glossary nor forced to read phonetic passages aloud to gather their meaning from their sound this seems a very artistic use of dialect for fiction is not merely a mosaic of local phrases and idioms and the art that plucks these wild flowers of speech and sets them before the painters figures and background is nearer akin to the craft of the panorama maker who fills his realistic foreground with dyed ferns and dead branches than to that of the painter who translates all essential details to be represented harmoniously in the one medium at his command this course seems more than ever admirable when home rule for novelists is a popular cry and the novel of locality finds a warm welcome it is encouraging to see that the wide district of somerset has been appropriated by so good a storyteller as mr raymond who loyal as he is to his chosen county never forgets that he appeals to a cosmopolitan audience and gives enough local colour and no more by this he makes the reader feel for the time a genuine resident in the district he has selected neither a cockney tourist bent on manufacturing stage pastorals from prosaic peasants nor a scientific visitor keen to discover how much of the kelt or saxon survives in the yeomen and yokels his is the best wayyou open  tryphena and forget everything except a vague sense of halfforgotten country scents blowing round youand the vivid planes of sunshine and shade so unlike the lowtoned harmony that faces you in town from the first word of the prologue to the last of the epilogue far too briefly traversed you are the unseen spectator of an idyll that is carefully selected from real life it is indeed a piece of genre painting of the highest order a pastoral comedy where tragedy pathos humour and above all love sway the actors in most human fashion yet as you read you forget to analyse and enjoy the artlessness of the telling unhindered by any critical purpose so mr raymond witches you and reveals the true secret of the raconteur that of hypnotising his audience to perfect sympathy the story itself might be told in a sentence it has but four characters mrs joshua pettigrewneither mrs poyser nor an aunt of maggie tulliver nor a relative of bathsheba

classic a form as bachs famous chaconne where the great sequence of chords repeated with a final major close gives at once the text and the peroration of the work this difficult form mr raymond wields as lightly as mr bret harte used his chorus of children in cressy a chance reader would not suspect the arbitrary plan underneath the fantasy so the dramatic unity is accomplished with perfect symmetry and yet retains all the vitality and freshness of an improvisation mr walter raymonds  mistertons mistake read half a dozen years ago has left passages fresh in ones memory still  gentleman

edition into two volumes the europeans  might very well have been printed in one and it is altogether too light in its workmanship to be classed among regular novels superior as it is to most of them it is in fact a daintilywritten aud wellconstructed prose comedy containing very few incidents and some of these being rather preposterous but on the whole giving a lively  sketch as he very fitly calls it of one phase of life and one aspect of character in new england the story is of an enterprising lady the daughter of american parents but born and bred in europe morgauatically married to a jetty german prince whose family is now anxious to divorce him from her amicably and of the adventures that follow from her efforts to fall in with these proposals if she can make it convenient to do so she bears the title of baroness munster and has persuaded her brother a goodnatured bohemian whose name is plain felix young and who has no other occupation than that of a strolling artist and an amiable pleasure seeker in general to go with her from her german home on a visit to their unknown kinsfolk who live somewhere near boston there we meet them in the first chapter and in the chapters that follow we arc entertained with the small confusions and complications occasioned by the arrival of these harmless bohemians in ti new england arcadia whose inmates for some time do not know what to make of them thc head of the family ibo strangers uncle is a mr wentworth a wealthy man and in every way as good as his own gold but so oppressed with the solemnity of life and its duties as to

everybodys happiness anet so unselfish that she does not know she is in love with mr brand the prim young unitarian minister whom sho is anxious to marry to her sister because she thinks the match would bc to her sisters spiritual welfaro and would be a very agreeable arrangement for mr brand himself gertrude wentworth is more visionary and something of an anomaly in this puritan family felix young comes as a revelation to her from the gay outside world about which she has been dreaming all her life and soon persuades her that ho is much more likely than mr brand to make her happy  there must be a thousand different ways of being dreary she says in one of her pretty naive flirtations with felix and sometimes i thinkwe make use of them all  i am trying for once to be natural she says

nature no i dont care for great questions i care for pleasurefor amusement here is a bit of the last chapter in which the family is discussing whether gertrude shall be allowed to marry felix   havent you confidence in felix gertrude was frowning thero was something about her that her father and charlotte had never seen before charlotte got up and came to her as if to put her arm round her but suddenly she seemed afraid to touch her mr wontworth however was not afraid  i have had moro confidence in felix than in you he said yes you have never had confidence in menever never i dont know why

want i havo chosen i am determined to marry this gentleman what little romance there is in  the europeans  gathers round the baroness and a certain mr acton  but we will not weaken the interest of the story to its readers by detailing this especially as the real merit of the book lies chiefly in its descriptions of gertrude and felix and the matters immediately concerning them these descriptions are fresh delicate and artistic to english readers the europeans will be particularly attractive because of the graceful picture mr janies draws of a condition of society hardly possible in this country and perhaps the kindly satire with which he touches up the picture will be as intelligible to them as to the americans who know the realities of nineteenth century puritanism in its pleasantest aspects in the out of the wray suburbs of boston we may hope great things of mr james when he tries his hand at a more elaborate novel,stories_contra

louis said or adopted the famous  letat cest moi but that is an excellent reason why a novelist who wishes to make the king act his part to the life should be chary of putting the actual words into his mouth madame de maintenon is made to overdo the rdle of virtue and is represented as an unattractive schoolmarm many will wish the scene with corneille had been omitted it is there to no purpose and though it is only thomas still there was enough family likeness between him and the proudest the most uncourtierlike of poets to make the fawning improbable even his recent election to the academy could hardly have reduced him to such a reptile condition if thomas corneille ever was actor in such a scene it might have remained unrecorded here but the historical part should not be taken too

maintenon dr conan doyle accepts without reserve the later version of her life and character which holds her up to esteem as a pure woman and devoted wife of his three volumes two are devoted to the intrigues of the french court and the third to the adventures of the refugees in america we cannot help thinking that the novel would have been more successful had the new world been more liberally treated in regard of space dr doyles robust imagination is hardly in its element in the artificial atmosphere of the court of louis x1tv and he emerges with credit rather than with distinction from the ordeal of inventing dialogues in which bossuet fonelon corneille conde and louvois are all conscientiously introduced his prodigious young new englander amos green is worth all the portraits of historical personages who crowd the canvas of twothirds of his tale in the last volume however the author gives a free rein to his adventurous fancy and proves himself a formidable rival on their own

the manxman mr hall caines new novel like the greater part of his work indeed has one special and noticeable quality it forces you to feel how straight out of his heart he writes a few other writers of fiction today may have equal emotional intensity but they are either careful to hide it or unable to express it he backs up this warmth of feeling by much else it is trueby humour by observation by excellent workmanship the manxman is a very full book fuller even than the deemster and  the bondman appealing to varied interests expending a lavish amount of material and showing no thinness or flimsiness anywhere still its special power over readers is emotional a power great and dangerous his keen appreciation of humour may generally be trusted to keep this other and stronger quality within bounds but one lights on a spot now and again where the atmosphere is sickly because the wholesome airs of humour have ceased for the moment to blow the novel is a tribute to his beloved island warmer even than  the deemster to the character of its people  the manxman by hall caine 6s heinemann to the picturesqueness of their simple lives it is in a sense a book of manx folklore and the descriptions of old rites and customs are the occasions of some of the most striking passages though one must admit that the artist has been driven too much by the patriot there is more of this lore than the story strictly needs the construction of the book is of the careful gradual order each important step beirg noted each phase in the life of the chief actors minutely examined care and conscientiousness it should be said mark every page it is to the first part descriptive of the early lives of philip christian the central personage and his humble cousin pete the hero that one looks back with keenest pleasure philip though an orphan lives a sheltered comfortable life while pete is a povertystricken neglected little urchin with no legal right to philips family name but the lads are staunch allies and the tale of their imaginary adventures as desperadoes the terror of all the islands is a charming bit of boylore  pete said philip with awful gravity  the seas calling me  and me said pete solemnly early that night the two lads were down at the most desolate part of port mavar in a cave under the scraggy black rocks of gobnygarvain kindling a fire of gorse and turf inside the remains of a broken barrel see that tremendous sharp rock below low water said philip  dont i though said pete there was never a rock the size of a currycomb between them and the line of the sky  thats what we call a reef said philip  wait a bit and youll see the ships go splitting on top of it likelike  like a taypot said pete well save the women though said philip shall we save the women pete we always do  aw yes the womenand the boys said pete thoughtfully philip had his doubts about the boys but he would not quarrel it was nearly dark and growing very cold the lads croodled down by the crackling blaze and tried to forget that they had forgotten teatime 1 we never has to mind a bit of hungry said philip stoutly never a haporth said pete only when the jobs done we have hams and flitches and things for supper  aw yes ateing and drinking to the full  rum pete we always drinks rum we has to said pete none of your tea said philip coorse not none of your old grannys twopenny tea said pete pete loves katherine the daughter of caesar  a mighty man among the methodists and a prosperous innkeeper and to win a home for her he goes to kimberley to make his fortune philip he appoints his doineymolla or manpraiser a post that demands intercession for the lover with the parents before betrothal and during the lovers absence attention to and protection of the lady philip has not allowed his education and conditions to separate him from his old comrade but his friendship does not protect him from temptation neither he nor katherine proves worthy of the guileless trust reposed in them pete comes home a rich man but not so rich in gold as in love for kate and his friend worldly prospects and the story of his own unequally mated father and mother keep philip from preventing the marriage but the woman unable long to bear her false position leaves her husband and is hid by ner old lover mr caine has attempted a great task in following the inner life of philip a man of sensitive soul of great talents and distinguished by fortune feeling himself every day more corrupted and degraded by a secret sin that brings him no gratification high or low the hunting of philip by his fortune and his conscience raises the book to a high tragic level kate in a sudden burst of unselfishness goes away but misfortune follows her and on her return she has to appear before philip the deemster on a charge of attempting her own life and is committed to gaol divorce proceedings with closed doors sever her from pete dis tinctions are showered on philip and his secret is safe but at the great ceremony of his appointment as governor he refuses the honour makes public confession goes to the prison and leads kate out a comparison here is inevitable the scene challenges comparison as voluntarily as do the turners hung side by side with the claudes in the national gallery if it is not longer than the one our mind reverts to it is too long and too unrestrained it does not thrill like  at last at last i stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward sustains me at this dreadful moment from grovelling down upon my face  lo the scarlet letter which hester wears ye have all shuddered at it wherever her walk hath beenwherever so miserably burdened she may have hoped to find reposeit hath cast a livid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her but there stood one in the midst of you at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered  perhaps it is not comparison alone that harms it philips creator will have him expiate his sin to the last among those who had held him in honour and will have him marry katherine they walk out of the story with a halo but what of philips heritage of weakness that had already driven him to intemperance and in katherine there was no nobility hers is a poor nature capable of better moments sufring curbs passion and often refines human nature but it cannot essentially change it and readers interested in these two cannot leave them with the thought they have found peace they had both suffered enough to have paid the price of death for one at least philips story and petes character are the outstanding features of the book pete is a real creation humorous unconsciously poetical and of a trustfulness in a shaky world heartbreaking to behold when he knows not where kate has gone he invents sublime falsehoods to account for her disappearance and you never heard tell of him not uncle joey with the bald head well well  a smart old man though man alive the lively he is too and the laughable and the good company to look at that mans face youd say the sun was shining reglar aw

joe of scotland road down clarence dock way  to think of that now  they went off with looks of perplexity and pete turned into the house theyre trying to catch me theyre wanting to shame my poor hli kirry i must keep her name sweet he thought of the letters he wrote to himself it would have been enough to give us a hint there is in them too insistent an appeal to our feelings any one who reads mr

  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival,stories_contra
  the traitors by e phillips oppenheim ward lock  co there is something eminently satisfactory about mr oppenheim as a novelist for he knows exactly what sort of a story he has to tell and he knows how to tell it he has at his command an abundance of fine sensational matter and as he uses it with a strict and skilful regard for the best entertainment of his readers his romances are usually effective it is hardly an exaggeration to say of  the traitors  that its interest begins on the first page and continues to the last the plot is ingenious and well managed the movement of the story is admiralty swift and smooth and the characters though by no means deep or complicated are at all events exceedingly vivacious the tale is pseudohistorical and thus obtains that glamour which hangs about great events and high personages of uncertain identity its scene of action is theos  a country which we suspect is situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of buritaniaand what with a revolution the recall of an exiled king a war with turkey and various political intrigues of a dramatic nature the readers excitement is kept on the stretch to the very end,stories_contra

fiction in connexion with the de willoughby claim by frances hodgson burnett f warne  co 6s it is not to be denied that mrs burnett can tell a tale and put into it some imagination this book is better than the authors recent productions it is of america and almost of the present time and we may hope now that she has finished with her excursions into england and the eighteenth century when we consider his grace of osmond with ito ingenious but sterile invention and then this large complicated spontaneous forcible picture of a national life which she really understands we lament that mrs burnett has wasted so much time on things british the story begins before the civil war in a remote village of north carolina where huge tom de willoughby estranged from hib family by their fault passes his existence in goodhumouredly pretending to keep the postoffice and a store it was inevitable perhaps that huge tom who had once nearly been a doctor should usher into the world a helpless girl and should adopt herthe mother dying and the supposed father deserting felicias queenly life in the rough village is done according to bret harte but done well and sincerely from such an inception the most elaborate intrigue is made to expand itself and mrs burnett is obliged again and again to throw back in her narrative so that family by family and group by group the characters may be fully presented felicia ultimately marries a handsome cousin and the divulging of the mystery of her birth makes a melodramatic chapter in the history of a famous preacher the whole book is tinged with melodrama and we are bound to say that the author relies too often upon an effect of pathos and exhibits a strong prejudice against certain characters these three defects apart the matter of the tale is sound and some of it is brilliant the recital of margerys death and the episode of susan chapman are indeed excellent mrs burnett writes as crudely as ever and this is a great pity she does not always even achieve grammar he invested in tonnes of machinery which were continually arriving from the north or stopping on the way when it should have been arriving as regards the writing the most annoying part of the book is the dialogue when mrs burnett uses dialect her dialogue is quite convincing but when her characters speak english they usually lapse into something which is as unlike human conversation as it well could be thus margery describing the minister to her protegee the millgirl  there is one gentleman who comes sometimes to see mr barnard at the studio he is so wonderful it seems to me he has travelled and knows all about the great galleries and the pictures in them he talks so beautifully that everyone listens when he comes in    you would thiok he would not notice a plain little willowfield girl but he has been lovely to me susan he has even looked at my work and criticised it for me and talked to me he nearly always talks to me a little when he comes in and once i met him in the gardens and he stopped and talked there and walked about looking at the flowers with me they had been planting out the spring things and it was like being in fairyland to walk about among them and hear the things he said about pictures it taught me so much margery never talked so it is merely that mrs burnett has reported her carelessly  in connexion with the de willoughby claim by franoe8 hodgson burnett in this story by the author of little lord fauntleroy we are in the states after the war of seoession when claims for compensation were being put before the government the

through a good novel of national life and loves young dream warne  co 6s  in connexion with the de willoughby claim by frances hodgson burnett 69 warne it is with real relief to find mrs hodgson burnett has left behind her the unreal mood out of which sprang  a lady of quality  and  his grace of osmonde and has returned to an earlier healthier temper her new story may be much less talked of  it is much less pretentious but there is stronger sounder work in it it is truer to human nature besides it is written in the vein which is peculiarly her own she has won all her best successes by a strong direct appeal to the emotions by the delineation of kindly simple peophe and by showing the triumphs of gentleness and of pity the story is modelled on the good old fairytale pattern where the fcol of the family leaves home scoffed at and hopeless and proves himself in the end the best and the most capable of the lot the scene is laid in the days after the american war when many southern claimants turned up in washington but not many with so good a right to northern sympathies as that of the heirs of old judge de willoughby it needed however all the obstinate patience of the ingenious and persevering tom formerly the fool to make good the claim in behalf of his beautiful and romantic young nephew who is to marry the darling of his heart the deserted child whom he had adopted when she was a few hours old all that portion of the book that deals with latimer and baird we dislike it is too long drawn out we guess bairds secret from the first and latimers grief for his sister was as unmanly as was his desertion of her child but the rest the pictures of the de ftoin anigo byj mis hodgsun bulrnieit alluta t on ry willoughby household of the humorous amusing neighbourly folks at talbots cross roads must be to everybodys taste there is good workmanship in the book but the best thing in it is the authors belief expressed here not for the first time that happiness is good for human souls  in connexion with the be willoughby claim nbw novels by frances hodgson burnett warne co the clumsiness of this title is fortunately not repeated in the book itself which makes decidedly pleasant reading the author has by long experience learned to write without those redundancies which are so common she is always clear and easy the humour and pathos of a nameless child brought up by a big burly stranger are just in her line and well sustained here the tragic and melancholy side of the book does not come off the fashionable preacher who secretly broke the seventh commandment and moves folks by commenting on it and the others is of no great force or interest at least he does not move us he and a melancholy follower of his both mixed up in the secret of the child are far too melodramatic as is an old maid a new miss dartle there are some other things overemphasized which experience leads one to put down to the feminine temperament still there is a capital devoted niggerservant and the sketches of life in a southern state just before the war are entertaining without an overdose of transatlantic phraseology,stories_contra

i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen  co mr maxwells latest novel is virtually an elaborate and conscientious portrait of a temperament all the interest centres in one dominant personality the figure of a strong man with a titanic capacity and a passion for work john barnards ambition is an almost superhuman obsession he loves his work for its own sake as well as for the rewards it is to bring him he rejoices alike in his own power and in the contest but in the struggle for success his domestic happiness suffers shipwreck eventually his health breaks down in such a manner that the world of action is completely closed to him while the life of thought and introspection opens the latter portion of the book is an interesting study in morbid pathology skilfully and even impressively done the main flaw in this cleverly told story is the psychological development of lady edith the wife which just misses being convincing through imperfect realization we cannot believe in her departure from the path of virtue  i the rest cure by w b maxwell methuen and co 6s every novelist is a psychologist nowadays the clash of mind with mind or the influence of mind upon mind forms the basis of ninetenths of our modern highly strung love stories not many writers however are as successful as is mr maxwell in delineating his characters in this latest novel from his pen we have perhaps as cleverly contrived a situation as he has ever given usthe antagonism between a man whose ideal is work work directed to one end and a woman whose ideal is love barnard who is rapidly rising in the financial world and means to rise to the top marries lady edith rathkeale in a severe attack of lovesickness she consenting sees in his tenderness the promise of a lifetimes happy comradeship he is never rough with her nor is he ever unkind or thoughtless but he simply does not understand her and is content in a placid unemotional way with the comforts of home which he samples between the rushes of business his wife gradually breaks down but by far the more serious collapse comes to barnard himself and a third of the book is taken up by the story of this failure of nerve and the effort to cure that strong overstrained brain we must say that here the interest flags considerably in spite of the long and wellwritten conversations the end is in view all the time and the reader grows restless on the whole however the situation is splendidly handled and the gradual drifting apart of husband and wife is portrayed very finely to make both of them seek consolation elsewhere was we think inartistic and a concession to the methods of the feujileton which the author should have resisted the redhaired typist and secretary with whom barnard has an  affair  is far too melodramatic to be convincing and the scene between her and lady edith carries little conviction barnard is capital with his colossal conceit of himself leave j b to his unfettered discretion  i john barnard he reminds us of the great joe bagstock the ending is sad but true to life and in the general scheme of his story mr maxwell proves himself a psychologist of no mean order,stories_contra

the daisy chain or aspirations a family chronicle by the author of the  heir of reddy fie c london john w parker and son 1856 we heard of an ironical gentlemans addressing a young lady the other day after this fashion 44 so you are for the heir of redclyffe i divide young ladies into two species one who swear by the heir of redclyffe and the other by queechy was it not an exasperating speech ladies  and an insulting comparison many will add yet queechy has its beauties too  not the hushed and sweet pervading charm the perfect taste the innate elegance the refined beauty no nor even the passion and intense interest of the heir of redclyffe but a simple untamed natural beauty of its own it is emphatically protestant and perhaps what is called a little sectarian  rough too and outspoken at times it has an air of the wild woods and the back settlements about it the 44 heir of redclyffe is like a deep blue italian sky with a rich gorgeous passionate sunset queechy is more like an autumn heaven iii our cold climate with merry patches of sunlight bursting through the gloom and a cold sharp healthful wind abroad chasing the falling leaves yet these are but fantastic similes and only play about the truth like bees that hover round the blossoms without settling the 4heir of redclyffe  is out of all compare the higher and the deeper work artistically and morally its foundations are deeper laid and its parts are more thoroughly selfconsistent it yields evidence of a highly cultivated mind a genial spirit a kind and generous heart and a clear and powerful intellect so keen is the discrimination of character evinced and so sweetly and unobtrusively is it displayed we might rather match miss yonges creations with those of miss sewell also admirable of their kind her 44 katharine ashton being an especial favourite  we were sorry to find her fall so far beneath herself in her late 44 cleve hall but both these gentle and cheering lights may well shine on in their kindred spheres without having the relative brilliancy of their orbits too curiously investigated the star of the 4 heir of redclyffe  casts a wider and more brilliant ray but there is a chaste and holy influence in the beams of the sister planet but no more of this come we to the matter directly at issue the merits of the 44 daisychain this is a certainly lengthy family chronicle of some 600 closely printed pages with little or no plot and perhaps not much romantic interest and yet it has interested and edified us not a little there is little or no direct didactic teaching but a healthful atmosphere breathes through the whole there are a thousand wayside flowers though no gorgeous magnolia or other hothouse blossoms the dear mother so soon removed the enthusiastic gallant generous father the doctor and all the children become familiar to us as real acquaintances we do not think of them as of characters in a book but as of actual people respecting whom we are entitled to hold our own opinions sometimes not coinciding with those of the author norman is too proud and too fastidious to please us though he is a noble fellow after all henry is well nigh our favourite of

more english altogether margaret verifies the motto si douce est la margarine mary flora all are to the life whether we like or dislike them but how yield our readers an idea of the charm of this book by quotations that were impossible unless the quotations were very ample and our review exceedingly elaborate within such limits as we shall allot ourselves we can only say that reading the 44 daisychain  is something like taking a walk through a plain country which does not appear romantic at first sight in the early summer when every chance step discloses some new object of delight the wild flowers in the hedges the rich blossom of the may the gay and giddy butterflies the blue sky overhead with its white clouds scudding past the sun and the sense of living joy which animates creation this is not a book to read straight through or in a hurry you will not enjoy it then you are not hurried along by wild excitement as in miss brontes startling creations but young people will love the 44 daisy chain and so will many of their elders and we feel that we are bound to thank miss young for teaching us unselfishness simplicity and rectitude in such a very pleasant and unpretending way she has strung a wreath of daisies it is true but they are daisies that will not wither  the daisy chain  or aspirations a family chronicle by the author of the heir of i redclyffe c parker  son the links of the daisy chain are eleven young children living in a country town with kind parents and a happy english home each daisy is the complete child of nature yet has its own individuality which is preserved throughout and each character speaks so naturally for itself that the reader seems to be one of the  chain and sitting in family conclave round the hearth the book must be taken up with a determination to enter into home feelings for story there is none the contrast between the children and their various  aspirations form the only incidents that verge on excitement so that the feelings must be interested alone by the truthfulness and simplicity of the family chronicle so many young heroes and heroines with their instructors give the author of the heir of redclyffe and  heartsease ample opportunities for exercising her peculiar genius for minute sketches of character but we must warn her that when carried into too minute ramifications it will be apt to be pronounced  finicking no better idea can be given of the story than by quoting the daisies mothers description of them which certainly will interest those the most who have daisies of their own  you say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies and if i do not write in these leisure days you will hardly get it after i am in the midst of business again the new daisy is

school he hus good abilities but not much perseverance or energy and i must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his schooldays begin in hopes of instilling them the girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys i suppose harry is too kind and generous to do more than tease him moderately and norman will see that it does not go too far lt is a common saying that

the hunting of thc snarl by lewis carroll london  macmillan  co 1876 somkoxe has said that it is very difficult to write in a rabelaisian tone about rabelais and though remark is true about the criticism of nonsense in general it is impossible to analyse in cold blood the impressions which ought to be given and received in high i spirits and high spirits are even more neces gary in the person who is to appreciate than in him who makes the joke the clown is successful in spite of the fact that he has just had an execution a fire a death and so on in his house as we have very often been told he is sure to get a laugh from the part of his audience that is in the vein but he only makes the melancholy soul more morbid but though it is hard to write boisterously about the pantomime and in a rabelaisian tone about rabelais it is only too easy to write snarkishly about the hunting of the snarjc one of the features of this mysterious creature was to put it mildly its uffishness  its slowness in taking a jest  should you happen to venture on oue it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed  and it always looks grave at a pun to tell the truth a painful truth it is this quality of the snark has communicated itself to the reviewer in the first place he is disappointed to discover that the hunting is written in verse why did not mr carroll stick to what walt whitman calls the free heaven of prose r the details of the chase would have made an episode in some nonsense epic very admirably but as a mere fragment of poetry the hunting is not so satisfactory the effect of alice was goti only put this forward tentatively as part of a  theory of nonsense considered as a fine art which will be elaborated when the new university commission establishes a chair in that branch of aestheticsmuch of the effect of alice was got by the contrast of her childish niceness and naturalness with the absurd and evanescent character of the creatures in wonderland now there is no sense in the territory of the snark at all except that mature and solemn experience of life which the reader brings with him ho is introduced to a bellman a butcher who can only kill beavers a beaver which makes lace a banker a barrister a baker who can only make bridecake a bonnetmaker and so on all just landed in the isle where though jubjub bird sings to the jabberwock hesees them in themselves he does not see them with the eyes of the child who as in alice takes them as natural persons in a world not understood this is the sad position of thc elderly reader and looking at the nonsense as nonsense for children one does not think they will see much fun in the barristers dream about  ancient manorial rights alibis insolvency treason and deseition or in the bankers presenting the  frumious bandersnatch  with a crossed cheque for seven pounds ten but to return to our snarks the bellman who was captain of the host had once occasion to remark  thal although common snarks do no manner of hann yet i feel it my duty to say some are boojums the bellman broke off in alarm for the baker had fainted away the baker was revived by suitable remedies and explained thc cause of his emotion    a dear uncle of mine after whom i was named remnrked when i lade him farewell 4 oh skip your dear uncle the bellman exclaimed as he angrily tinkled his vii 1 he remarked to me then said that mildest of men  if your snark be a snark that is right fetch it home by all meansyou may serve it with greens and its handy for striking a light but oh beamish nephew beware of though day if your snark bo a bojum  for then you will softly and suddenly vanish away and never bo met with again  this fearful revelation as the bellman justly said should not have been kept back till the snark was at the door and it was in vain that the baker pleaded that he had already mentioned the fact in hebrew and dutch in german and greek when people start together on a voyage in unknown seas they cannot be too explicit in stating the conditions of the adventure the awful fate of the baker should be laid to heart by everyone who goes out to look for snarks happiness an eastern policy and other such

in the air a weary and wandering sigh that sounded like  jum  but the others declare it was only a breeze that went by they hunted till darkness came on but they found not 3 button or feather or mark

dies and of course the hero and heroine are married at last the book does not realise the anticipations of those who have read other works by whyte melville there is an insufficiency of development in tiie characters except that of fanny draper perhaps and the materials of the story are not worked together with the authors usual success  but the writing is unquestionable and the narrative decidedly interesting the manner of the book is like that of an etching by betsch or dore it is full of vivacity and force of simple grace and true expression but it is the triumph of vigorous or delicate outline independent of colour no character is worked out in detail as it would be by lawrence or by trollope groups and scenes are dashed off in a rapid slapdash way and sometimes we have very perceptibly evidence of the faults and errors of that way of working but every artist of observation fancy and wit has a right to his own way if it be but consistent to itself etchings are not paintings and they ought not to be held deficient in merits to wbich they do not pretend they have in them a power of their own specific and peculiar and a very great power it isthat of indelibly impressing images on the memory of remarkable attitudes looks or forms from wbich are in a certain sense abstracted the thousand qualifying incidents and accessories that painting must record the

the port of dreams by miriam alexander andrew melrose 6s miss alexander is to be congratulated on having produced an excellent characterstudy of a man of gallant spirit whose physical courage is not always equal to the exigencies of an adventurous life but the jacobite setting she has chosen for her hero is unfortunate colonel clavering is a modern type his introspective habit and his intense mental anguish when his courage fails him at a great crisis would hardly have been understood by his generation the dialogue slips uneasily from the early eighteenth to the twentieth century the picture the author draws of the social life of ireland at the period is interesting and historically accurate  fiction the port of dreams 1d   i by miriam alexander andrew i ivicirose us t his is a story of a young irish girl who is portrayed as having lived in jacobite times and as a study of feminine character is distinctly unsatisfying there are dramatic descriptions and the story is well told and interesting notwithstanding many defects in the delineation of character both male and female despite merit it must be confessed that the book as a whole leads up to a rather commonplace and melodramatic climax the impression inevitably presents itself that the authoress ideal of femininity is represented by a young girl who is deficient in some of the finest attributes of her sex whose mind is dominated by an illdirected obsession which debars her from the capacity of ascertaining the love of her heart and the true goal of her destiny her unbalanced mind might in the present day have rendered her responsible for window smashing and pillarbox outrages her lack of appreciation of essentials and of that which her nature demands induces a political zeal tending to a catastrophe a victim to the lustre of heroworshipthe  hero  in this case being an unlikely old colonel in a condition of dotagethe girl lovable in many respects is guilty of the incredible folly of sending the young man she loveswithout realising the factto the gallows it is of no consequence that the reader does not greatly deplore this fact because the real hero as depicted presents an impossible irish soldier of exaggerated chivalry and of pronounced inherent stupidity the exact contrary of the model even of those days that is immaterial the woman loved him and if both sides of her womans nature had been normally developed she could not have been guilty of the insane conduct which led to the catastrophe the book narrowly escapes being a really good novel had not common sense and logical probability been sacrificed in the interest of an imaginary and somewhat hysterical search for dramatic effect,stories_contra
the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to

run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always

hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition

wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other

one of our conquerors in 3 vols by george meredith chapman  hall tile works of a writer past tie prime of life are apt to display a certain excess or extravagance what was once his strength has now become his weakness and his virtue has changed into his vice this is most often seen in the case of very strong and masterful writers those whose good work is all done in some one annus mirabilis or flowering season fall into more decay as coleridge or as wordsworth it is in writers whose whole life has been full of successful toil and untiring effort that manner degenerates into mannerism such writers and indeed all artists of such a kind are often men who have discovered some new way in art and who possess a secret and a power proper to themselves the world used to the old and familiar ways will not at once take notice of them in proportion to their faith in themselves and their fidelity to their art these artists unshaken and undeterred continue upon their way rather increasing than relaxing their unappreciated labours slowly and gradually the world comes round to their side is converted to their faithwelcomes them with applause but what of the artists all this long time  is there no danger that in a kind of unconscious defiance and challenge they will have gone too far and grown enamoured of that in their work which the world did well to blame  if the world cried out upon their obscurity where there was some obscurity but not much was it not natural in them to have replied with worse obscurities out of an impatient contempt and exasperation  it is permissible to think that browning had a little of this feeling when he filled his later books with so much more argument than imagination landor dared to think that milton in paradise regained was  subject to strange hallucinations of the car now milton held although the world does not that paradise regained is superior to paradise lost it is as though foreseeing the  revel of rhyme  that was to supersede his greater harmonies he gathered himself together and went nigh to straining the resources of his rhythm beyond its just capacity it has been said of late that mr meredith in his new book has likewise exhibited  the defects of his qualities  that his former work reached the farthest limits of successful audacity and that one of our con querors has passed beyond them cordial and enthusiastic admirers of mr meredith are ringing the changes upon wilful eccentricity  and  wanton obscurity  and lack of proportion in design since the present writer is unable to share these opinions it is incumbent upon him to acknowledge that upon reading the book for the first time he did not reckon it a masterpiece read three or four times the book grows upon the reader the apparent confusion disappears the intricacies of design become intelligible and the whole greatness of design is evident hasty impression yields to careful meditation let us take first a question of style is one of our conquerors written in a style of grotesque and perverted eccentricity whilst richard 1ctere or thie egoist is full of true force and beauty  that can be maintained only by one who has not read mr merediths earlier books for a year at least one who retains a sense of their greatness forgetting all but their final and permanent effect again he who maintains that view muist have ignored this fact that with ir meredith style and subject change or grow together in proportion as the subject is simple or idyllic or tragic or humorous or rapid so does the style assume those qualities if the chief influences brought to bear upon the chief characters be influences of the great and busy world of crowded and coimplicated life then the style reflects the nature of those influences all air merediths books are full of stir and animation  but three of them in especial are full of this general or social life this business and animation felt in the very atmosphere in beauchamps career and diana of the crosswalls and one of our conquerors it is not too much to say that the world or  society or  the public or the nation seems to rank among the dramatis personae now most english writers who wish to make an effect of this kind to suffuse their work with this breath of the general life attempt it by pages of reflection and description in which the words are abstract and the sentences are sentiments unless the writer be very skilful his writing will 0 very dull at the best it will too often be mere rhetoric but air meredith differs in this from almost every other novelist of eminence  that he sees thoughts as things emotions as images the abstract as the concrete he has eyes for the form and colour of an idea he presents it to us full of life it is now a truism to say that a cause is identical with its effects but the illustration may help us out when an ordinary writer gives us an idea he gives it us in a dull and sparing way the implicit truth is there but it remains implicit he states as it were a cause air meredith states the effects the explicit operations of the cause  the thought is expressed in concrete terms his lively phrases are not metaphorical but logical the ideas are translated into their equivalent expressions in actual life those readers are surely wrong who regard mr merediths characteristic phrases as so many attempts at opigram and wit critics have publiihied lists of air merediths failures  in epigram they might as well be called his failures in epic all such characteristic phrases are rather faithful translations of general and abstract ideas into expressions of their concrete contents of meaning translations by a huiourist whose humour need not relish the phrase whicih may 10 ludicrous but the act of making it the discovery that do but examine such and such an idea and the phrase will he found to express it so that when mr moredith is accused of straining after wit he iz in reality but keeping close to facts which is apt to be a grimly serious form of humour it may not lie amiss to comparo with mr merediths manner of expressing ideas his maimer of expressing nature his poems for heenness of sight for close contact with the most precise details have few rivals  and here ho reverses his process and from an expression of the visible or the audible in nature ho passes to its meaning for man in thought in this way lie keeps touch with both sides of life  real and ideal analytic and synthetic  he cannot understand one without the other as is always the case with all true writers the consideration of mr merediths style passes insensibly into that of his subject it may be assuiiied that most readers of the ac y are now acquainted with hl f one oimpl rw  so t hat iiistead of a laimie description of thu iook we may consider one or two iints which are of the gretest interest to begin with victor radnor and his position when a young maii lie to put ii with all possiblo crudity married an old woman for her money cortain critics have cried 1 ad   and refused to consider the possibility of his ever afterwards redceauing that dishonourablo act of youthful folly such a criticism shows the inadequacy of petrified moral codes victors act was not merely an offence arainst conventional laws of hollour which chiango with time but against inunutablo laws of nature and his next act was in defiance of conventional law but in harmony with reason and with nature 1le took for his true wife in all but legal rights a woman prepared to obey her nature and his the first wrong to nature is redressed by a diregard of convention now all this talk about nature and conventionality might in the case of a weak writer have leen no more than a somewhat nauseous cnt in the least desirable style of rousseau but amr moredithneed it he said ignores nothing with a conception of tragic art and of moral law which is amng his greatest achievements lie shows us the failure of both father and mother victor and nataly victor is too enamoured of the world which lie has defied and oaxed and nataly too afraid of it but lie also shows us their triumph in their child in nesta we agre with colney durance when he considered the shallowness of the abstract optimist exposed cmiugh in victors history le was reconciled to it when looking on their child he discerned that for a cancelling of the riors chargeable tothiin the father and mother had keit faith with nature nesta  neither cherishing a prosperous superstition about the world based upon worldly success nor a shrinking fear and deference bred of one noble disloyalty to conv entioncan face the world upon fair terms she neither accepts its stupid prose nor dreams over its false poetry but interpreting the reason in nature she has every true power upon her side mr meredith has drawn more portraits and characters of true women than any other englishman but shakspore and browning nesta is it may be thought the truest of them all thou hast left behind powers that will work for theeair earth and kies theres not a breathing of the common wind that will forget thee  thou hast great allies thy friends are exultations agonies and love and mans unconrluerable mind the lines came into our mind when reading the last pages of the book as applicable to the woman who with all her zeal upon unpopular sides and for bold causes nover lost tolerance for the world of folly and of intolerance except only  when she thought of it as the world condemning her mother lio r joinso  literature one of our conquerors by george meredith 3 vols chapman  hall 1 the burman and her notions to plagiarise the title recently adopted by the ingenuous mr shway yoe might fittingly serve as a subheading for mr merediths latest novel all through the book though she is studiously kept in the background and her utterances are limited to a dozen lines the grim figure of this muchwronged lady haunts her victims like a veritable erinnys whether she is sitting  with her fashionable nobonnet striding the contribution chignon on the crown and a huge green shade over her forehead ghoulishly sampling new mixtures in the chemists shop at charing cross or crazily imagining herself the wife of the expremier widow of prince le boo and engaged to though chinese ambassador or as in the final reconciliation scene at her own house near the regents park gazing with wide orbits for sunken eyes a wasted ghost from a pale blue silk veiling her interminable existence the unconscionable time she takes adying a limpet of vitality with drugs for blood constitute the key to the whole tragedy the dignus vindice nodus which defies the cheery optimism of victor radnor and the patient sufferance of his nataly when young and foolishan innocent a positive innocent as he describes himselfhe married the old woman for her money a small boy tempted by a varnished widow with pounds of barleysugar in her pocketand speedily finding the situation intolerable ran off with her charming companion the gentle contralto natalia dreighton his awe  inspiring spouse devised and executed a terrible revenge desertion without reasonable excuse when coupled with adultery is as we all know a cause for which a wife may obtain a decree of divorce but mrs burman radnor has no intention of putting the law in motion against her husband wherever the hapless couple elect to take up their abode this illomened creature or her spectral butleremissary jarniman stirs up prejudice against them and like the harpies at the virgilian banquet diripiuntque dapes contactu que omnia foedant inmundo driving the unwedded lovers from pillar to postfrom craye to creckholtwith re morseless persistence the case is complicated for them poor souls by the fact that their daughter nesta knows nothing of the bend sinister that blots her scutcheon and as she grows up the difficulty of explaining these constant changes of residence becomes greater people fall in love with her too and then explanations are necessary lakelands the great house in the country the magnificence of which is to compel recognition on the part of mrs grundy never receives its inmates for permanent occupation the big speech which is to establish victors position as candidate for a south london constituency remains unspoken for just as mrs bunnan on her longdeferred deathbed proclaims a tardy forgiveness and all is being prepared for the ceremony which will right the wrongdoers in the eyes of a censorious world comes the crushing blow of natalys own decease but five hours and a half before that of her aged rival and so with victors lunacy the edifice of his aims and ambitions falls crashing to the ground and the lifelong tragedy of this irregular union finds burial in his grave we must not however ignore the relief afforded by the underplot that deals with nestas love affairs the rev septimus barmby the hon dudley sowerby and capt dartrey fenellan are a trio of characters whose workingout is accomplished in mr merediths happiest manner and nesta herself is an exquisite creation fit to rank beside lucy feverel and clara middleton the scenes in which the rev septimus takes part are full of rich humour as witness the following where he ponderously urges his unwelcome suit  mr barmby headed to the pier after pacing up and down between the briny gulls and a polka band lie made his way forethoughtfully to the glasssheltered seats fronting east where as his enthusiasm for the solemnity of the occasion excited him to say  we have a view of the terraces and the cliffs and where not more than two enwrapped invalid figures were ensconsed then it was that nesta recalled her anticipation of his possible designshe wished she could have run before him to spare him he would not notice a sign girls must wait and hear it was an oratorio she watched the long wave roll on to the sinking into its fellow  and onward again for the swell and the weariful lapse  and up at last bursting to the sheet of white the farheard roar and the near commingled giving mr barmby a semblance to the powers of ocean at the first direct note the burden of which necessitated a pause she petitioned him to be her friend to think of himself as her friend but a vessel laden with merchandize that has crossed wild seas for this particular port is hardly to be debarred from discharging its goods on the quay by simple intimations of their not being wanted we are precipitated both by the aim and the tedium of the lengthened voyage to insist that they be seen we believe perforce in their temptingness and should allurement fail we fall back to the belief in our eloquence an eloquence to expose the qualities that they possess is the testification in the promise of their excellence she is to be induced by feeling to see it we are asking a young lady for the precious gift of her hand we respect her  and because of our continued respect despite an obstruction we have come to think we have a claim upon her gratitude  could she but be led to understand how different we are from some other men  from one hitherto favoured among them unworthy of this prize however personally exalted and meritorious  the wave of wide extension rolled and sank and rose heaving lifeless variations of the sickly streaks on its dull green back if mr barmbys solemnity inspires mirth the mental limitations of the second aspirant dudley good fellow though he be render him an equally unattractive wooer he plays the flute with considerable skill and is tall straightfeatured correct in costume appearance deportment second son of a religious earl and no scandal to the parentage but one can see at a glance that he will never suit the quickwitted warmblooded nesta and his advances and retreats his qualms and questionings as depicted in a masterly chapter which exhibits  a conventional gentleman endeavouring to examine a spectre of himself deprive him once for all despite subsequent accesses of generosity of the readers esteem he has learnt be it said from her own mothers lips the story of the girls illegitimacy venerating purity as he did the question whether the very sweetest of pure young women having such an origin must not at some time or other show trace of the origin surged up if he could only have been sure of her moral exemption from taint a generous ardour in reserve behind his anxious dubieties would have precipitated dudley to quench disapprobation and brave the world under a buckler of those monetary advantages which he had but stoutly to plead with the house of cantor for the speedy overcoming of a reluctance to receive the nameless girl and prodigious heiress his familys instruction of him and his inherited tastes rendered the aspect of a nature stripped of the clothing of the laws offensive down to devilish  we grant her certain steps upon certain conditions accompanied by ceremonies and when she violates them she becomes visibly again the revolutionary wicked old beast bent on levelling our sacredest edifices an alliance with any of her votaries appeared to dudley as an act of treason to his house his class and his tenets and nevertheless he was haunted by a cry of criminal happiness for and at the commission of the act no dudley will not do emphatically but what of dartrey fenellan  let mr meredith describe him  not two minutes had passed before she waa at home with him his words his looks revived her spirit of romance gave her the very landscapes and new ones yes he was her hero but his manner made him also an adored big brother stamped splendid by the perils of life he sat square as if alert to rise with an elbow on a knee and the readiest turn of head to speakers the promptest of answers eyes that were a brighter accent to the mouth so vividly did look accompany tone this is the beginning of their intercourse friendship bigbrotherhood on his part dawning love on hers but events move swiftly between a pair like these both so highcouraged and so free from commonplace trammels a few pages further on we find them discoursing after this fashion on the subject of nestas innocent indiscretion in visiting the unhappy mrs marsett  so my own mother and loving me as she does blames me  nesta sighed  she took a sharp breath  you  do you blame me too  he pressed her hand enamoured of her instantaneous divination and heavenly candour  but he was admonished that to speak high approval would not be honourable advantage i n taken of the rival condemning  and he said fi  blame i some think it is not always the right  a thing to do the right thing i ve made mistakes with no bad design a good mothers riew is not often wrong   you pressed my hand she murmured that certainly had said more glad to again he responded it was uttered airily and was meant to be iva lightly done  nesta did not draw back her hand  i feel strong when you press it her voice wavered and as when we hear a flask sing thin at the niling ceased upon evidence of a heart surcharged how was he to relax the pressure  he had to give her the strength she craved  and he vowed it should be but for half a minute half a minute longer  her tears fell  she eyed him steadily  she had the look of sunlight in shower  oldish men are the best friends for you i suppose he said  and her gaze turned elusive phrases to vapour  he was compelled to see the fiery core of the raincloud lighting it for a revealment that allowed as little as it retained of a shadow of obscurity the sight was keener than touch and the run of blood with blood to quicken slumbering seeds of passion  but here is the place ol broken ground and tangle which calls to honourable men not bent on sport to be wary to guard the gunlock he stopped the word at his mouth it was not in him to stop or moderate the force of his eyes she met them with the slender unbendingness that was her own  a feminine of inspirited manhood there was no soft expression only the direct shot of light on loth sides  conveying as much aa is born from sun to earth from earth to sun and when such an exohange has come between the two they are past plighting they are the wedded one  nesta felt it without asking whether she was loved she was his she had not a thought of the word of love or the being beloved showers of painful blissfulness went through her as the tremours of a shocked frame while she sat quietly showing scarce a sign  and after he had let her hand go she had the pressure on it the quivering intense of the moment of his eyes and grasp was lord of her lord of the day and of all days coming that is how love slays death never did girl so give her soul there is only one man alive in england who could have written that passage and he is mr meredith its subtlety and strength are alike astonishing and it reveals him at his very beat the minor characters of the novel are no less original than the bulk of their authors personages little skopsey the confidential clerk with his scheme for the regeneration of england by means of the resuscitation of the noble art of selfdefence and his repeated collisions with the authorities is a droll and lovable figure and the duvidney ladies especially in that im mortal  night piece which deals with the malodorous irruption of their lapdog tasso and its important consequences evoke hearty laughter the priscilla graveses and peter yatts and the rest of the strange crew who  could meet and mix in victors concertroom with nn easy homely recognition of one anothers musical qualities at times enthusiastic are not very clearly defined and do not rouse moro than a passing interest but corney durance and simeon fenellan the embodiments respectively of a gloomy and a gay cynicism are not without their attraction for the discriminating reader while there is much skill in the fleshandblood portraits of mrs blachenoy and lady graco halley to say that the book is by mr meredith is to say that it is full to the brim of brilliant things the hand that dispensed the treasures of the  pilgrims scrip is still prodigal of epigram the best specimens of his workmanship in this kind are fathered with somewhat tedious iteration upon the saturnine colney durance who crushes a class to extract a drop of scathing acid surely never was a man so quoted by his acquaintance as colney says as old corney would remark that is like colneys that reminds me of mr durances such are the too obtrusive pegs on which mr meredith loves to hang the dazzling garments of his wit yet critics must be thankful after yawning over the inanities which pass for conversation in the ordinary novel for the display of a wardrobe so resplendent there is incidentally a good deal of fine description of natural objects the following sketch of the change from night to day as seen from a channel steamer is remarkably happy   now was the cloak of night worn threadbare and grey astir for the heralding of gold day visibly ready to show its warmer throbs the gentle waves were just a stronger grey than the sky perforce of an interfusion that shifted gradations  they were silken in places oily grey  cold to drive the sight across their playful monotonousness for refuge on any far fishersail till a few lines later one reads of the splendour of the low full sunlight on the waters the skimming and dancing of the thousands of golden shells away from under the globe of tire or take this passage conjuring up as in a glass though whole charin of the scenery of tyrol  he had in memory prominently now the many glorious pictures of that mountainland beckoning to him waving him to fly forth from the london oven lo the tyrolese limestone crags with livid peaks and snow lining shelves and veins of the crevices  and folds of pinewood undulations closed by a shoulder of snow large on the blue  and a dazzling pinnacle rising over green pasturealps the head of it shooting aloft as the blown billow high off a broken ridge and widearmed in its pure white shroud beneath  tranced but all motion in immobility to though heart in the eye  a splendid image of striving up to crowned victory but mr meredith is not always so fortunate in his phraseology he will occasionally bo striking at whatever cost and the result is not unnaturally pure caviare to though general the vagaries of genius are visible both in grammar and spelling to say nothing of the daring with which this prose pindar per audaces nova dithyrambos verba devolvit to be the stumblingblocks of simple souls we have toneing in one line but  changing  in the next  defense meets us in its american guise and a dressmakers block becomes a dumby the verbs spring and jump are used strangely nestas words sprang a stinging tear to the mothers eyelids and of an episode in colney durances satiric serial it is said that it jumped me to bravo the cleverness on one occasion  mademoiselle rippled her shoulders on another victor jerked a dead laugh while dr gannius  crashes cachinnation and m falarique  damascenes his sharpest smile people are continually crapeing and drapeing all sorts of queer things mr meredith has also some fearful and wonderful adjectives or collocations of words doing duty for epithets the  sternajerk empty barges which occur in a capital description of the thames as seen from london bridge and  the bank of blueish smackocheek red cloud above whitechapel may serve as illustrations  busy antish congregates and  hypocritical judex air are other adjectival essays to our mind not overfelicitous  the stormy squaro of the first of seamen  the riverina green field on the rock  airics blue mud of the glittering teeth the hallowing squire of though stables a riding master the raised orchestral flooring a platform and tho brownpaper envelope of the wires a telegram are other odd flowers of speech mr meredith shows a liking for the termination lyquakerly and martyrly are both to be found in these pages gulls as we have already seen are briny like the element they soar over and a baboon is  branchy the proper names selected for the characters are often successful but in naming his creations the author does not show the unerring instinct of thackeray who could people a dinnertable with appropriately christened guests at a moments notice septimus barmby is good and so is   grosenian buttermore   colney durance is artfully suggestive but we cannot away with stuart rem or mancate semhians and julinks and beaves urmsing strain our powers of belief to breakingpoint is it too late to beg of mr meredith that he will have some compassion on his weaker brethren in these and such like matters they are but the mint and cummin of literature but they provoke an irritation which does something to prevent the growth of his popularity without acknowledging ourselves to be of the number of those who cannot stomach his tougher utterances we are sure that we voice the feelings of many wouldbe admirers when we ask him to allow the stream of his genius to flow a little less turbidly that it can do so much of his earlier work and many pages of his new novel conclusively prove as he is strong let bini be

should like also to say incorruptiblebut there is a sad leanin t whiggery here which smacks of the blandishments of the castle among other conquests of the anglonormans in ireland they may add that of the wild irish girl mr stanley and his tribe have bowed her out of the strongholds of irish wrong nevertheless whig or bewhigged it is impossible for lady morgan to write that of ireland which is not well worth readin  the dramatised sketch of ireland is instinct with real life and gives a lively picture of the theological parties which now divide ireland and an excellent picture of its present political state for the sake of which we forgive all mr sackville s prosing not less foolish than the fashionable silliness of his aristocratic doll of a wife in character this sketch is particularly rich the polypuses the galbraiths the blackacres the mdermots and brians all own their creator s power of animating a shadow caricatures they may be but they are the caricatures that far more nearly resemble daily life in ireland than the most finished portrait the tendency of the drama is to show that any man of property who endeavours to live in ireland must soon if he is rational be either shot or crucified that all just and unprejudiced persons must be perforce absentees  that ireland is in the hands of certain parties who never suspend their mutual struggles and contentions save to run down some benevolent individual who stands aloof lady morgan maintains that all has been done for ireland that need be coercion bill and all and that all which that unhappy country wants is repose it is all that has been wanted then for 300 years lady morgan is like the cook who said to the writhing skinned and scotched eels be still ye wantons when elements of opposite natures are thrown together effervescence will take place these elements are struggling together now but lady morgan says to them be still and some time hence all will le well more especially if you believe that the mere accession of the whigs is the actual signal of the commencement of the milleniura we shall take another opportunity of observing upon the idolatry of fashion which discovers itself in this as in all lady morgans works we see it here under a vainly attempted suppression there is no intention to make parade of it but the signs of devotion appear lady morgan cannot name an eight oclock dinner without a reverential feeling and with excessive unction she describes the bearing of a groom of the chambers and the sonorous announcements of the porter in a ducal hall these things are with her the pomp and circumstance of fashion which she blazons with a swelling heart she has the pride of knowledge in the province of modes true she professes to despise the fashionists and probably does despise them but she has a reverence for the fashion she attacks the tree at the root but she is never weary of admiring the fruit every now and then the sentiment in all its fullness will break out for instance in manor sackville where the example of a man of fashion is launched as a thunderbolt at a parasite recusant of tomfoolery by the way we think this an error the lady who deals out the rebuke is supposed to be a person of fashion and does any person of fashion talk of fashion and cite its authorities to awe the vulgar into obedience  amongst the pretenders the upstarts the wouldbe fashionable one hears of nothing but  men of fashion and  women of fashion and  circles of fashion  but people conscious of the establishment ot their claims are silent on them for this reason with

fiction tfhe obirudlit by hmuamue belloc nelson 2s many stories have been written of the fateful year 1792 when france was aflame and adventures were to be had without the seeking and by attempting the grand style and the large scale many have failed mr belloc takes his young girondin hero lover and adventurer through a very short course and closes his story with death but lie succeeds and his touch is unmistakable sometimes he isp oking fun at georges boutroux sometimes he is full of admiration for him sometimes again in the garb of a wise witty showman with a soul above earthly things lie seems to point out the insignificance the uselessness of the toil and trouble the marching and countermarching the noise and bewilderment that go to make a revolution always he carries the reader with him by reason of that confidential sympathetic quality which when he will can hold us in a magic spell his style on some pages of this brief romance is exceptionally beautifulreminiscent perhaps of the book of ruth take for example a few sentences from the chapter where a lover finds himself in the dark boutroux is in hiding at a charcoalburners hut the young girl who sheltered him speaks  you will stay here she said you must not move and you must trust me i will bring you food  there will never be a time he said  that you may come whether you bring me food or no but i shall feed and even when you are not here i shall feed in a fashion upon a shade she would not answer him she put the yoke upon her graceful shoulders so that they were bent to her labour she straightened herself and swung the pails and went out to the fieldshortkilted walking strongly and with the morning upon her he saw her for but a moment as she passed the door but almost immediately as she left him there came palely through that same entry the first ray of the sun it bore with it a sort of miraculous enlivenment and a changing of all things as it came the whole story we will not recount here if any reader wants a real tale of danger love and difficulties greatly overcome of a young man whose spirit never failed who lied grandly and lived his life to the fulllet him buy  the girondin he will want to hear more of the charming joyeuse but perhaps in some future volume mr belloc may find her for us again  new novkl8 the oirondin by hilaire belloc nelson it is a pleasure to come upon a novel of the french revolution which does not deal with the french revolution mr bellocs tale it is true opens with a spirited sketch of girondist conditions in bordeaux and an outbreak and he has introduced certain military movements incident to the year 1792 but his narrative is not concerned one whit with marquises and sansculottes and the tumbrils and the terror it deals with the fortunes of a young man who is obliged by a foolish act of violence to become a fugitive from both parties and who is finally killed by misadventure on a battlefield the value and interest of the story are wholly derived from mr bellocs realisation of such a mans environment and life it is a little bewildering to his reader at times  the action moves in a confusion towards a confused end but this may almost be considered as part of the authors art as the events in which boutroux was engaged were probably as confused to him there is an admirable account of a battle which does not compete with stephen cranes remarkable study in the red badge of courage but is nevertheless as intuitively true mr bellocs style of english is above reproach a welcome phenomenon in a day when fiction is of reprehensible slovenliness,stories_contra
fiction montes the matador and other stories by frank harris grant richards 6s the author of elder conklin employs in all his fiction the device of what we would call  simple narration a device used by balzac and turgenev but not we think by any other great european novelist of the nineteenth century not even strangely enough by de maupassant the user of this device may be deemed to adopt the following attitude toward his reader   see here i have some very curious and interesting facts to tell you and i will relate them straightforwardly without embroidery and with only such explanations and descriptions as are absolutely necessary i merely want you to get hold of the facts indeed you must listen to them because they have interested me tremendously and i am sure they will interest you whatever you do dont mistake me for a romancer a concocter of stories now just listen and i wont waste your time  there now wasnt that worth hearing  true  of course it is true that is why i wished you to hear it such an attitude and such a method employed with skill and discretion are enormously effective in the way of vraisemblance and vraisemblance is esteemed by novelists the highest quality of narrative art it isntno one ever imagined that paradise lost was truebut that is another and a larger question there are five stories in mr harriss volumetwo rather slight and unequal to the three larger onesand each leaves you with the impression that the events told did actually occur the best tale is the first one the lovestory of an old espada told like most of the others in the first person it is a sinister and powerful recital and the bullfighting lore comes out of the mouth of old montes in a very natural and convincing manner  profit and loss  is a tale of kansas citymr harriss cosmopolitanism amounts almost to an affectationand the theme is an arson committed by an employee at the instigation of his employer the reward being the latters daughter the analysis of the criminals feelings after the crime is one of the best things in the book  he realised that all efforts were in vain that nothing could check the fire that his work was done completely and then remorse came upon him at first with a vague sense of loss nuch as one feels in missing the familiar and accustomed later with the full understanding of waste and destruction as acutely keen regret    the last story  sonia is russian and very obviously it has been composed at the feet of ivan turgenev mr harris could not have gone to a better master but nevertheless sonia is only a clever imitation the episode of the assassination of alexander ii is here used with singular dramatic effect the book as a whole is capable but mr harriss careless way of writing english will prevent him from taking so high a place as he might otherwise have occupied  montes thc matador aud other stories short storiei by frank harris g richardsthere are two excellent stories in this book the first and though one called first love a confession  montes the matador is tiie story of a great matadors love and hate but it is chiefly remarkable for the wonderful descriptions of bullfighting which occur in it mr harris not only must havo seen and enjoyed the sport but he makes his readers see it enter into though spirit of it and admire the excitement the wonderful escapes and the combined daring and skill of good bulllighters whether cspada banderillo or ehulo as a dramatic description of the great spanish tport by a lover of it this could not lie bettered she sordid aspect and the cruelty are left out of sightbut that is right for the matador who tells the story would not see them  he sees only the glorious excitement and the art of it ho even reveals a sort of love for the bulls whom he kills which comes from his intimate knowlodge of their character and their differences the story too which he tellshot passionate and cruelseems to flt exactly with the atmosphere to which it belongs in its way this tale is perfect tliero is not a jarring touch in it it is simply a bit of spanish life  first love is good also though it does not seem so inevitable as the first story lt is the description of the calflove of a very young girl for a quite ordinary young man to whom she attaches all manner of heroic qualities she linds that she can attract him against his will but knowing that ho does not love her she goes away and delilerately kills her passion he meets her years afterwards when he is prosperously married hears the story from her and is sorry at what he missed the conscientious vulgarity and stupidity of the young man on the stock exchange are admirably indicated in his own jmrrative of though events mr harris by the way shows great skill in allowing the unimaginative young englishman honourable but terribly commonplace to reveal himself unconsciously in describing his love affairs it is just the same type of man this time a budding mp who plays the second rule in the last story  sonia his ijewildorment and almost unwilling attraction on meeting a young woman ol unconventional ideas are very well suggested by his falling in love with her chiefly because she is a mystery to him and his very evident though shamefaced relief when he leaves her to consort with his correct young friends in the diplomatic service nevertheless sonia herself is not quite convincing and still less is though hero of profit and loss this is an otherwise delightful study in irony but it is spoilt by our inability to believe that david tryon would ever really have committed the crime he is here represented to have perpetrated altogether it is a book which proves mr harris to be in the first rank ot shortstory tellers  notes on novels these notes on the weevs fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow montes the matador by frank harris three books stand to mr frank harriss name elder conklin und other stories which was received with considerable

the woman who vowed by ellison harding fisher unwin 6s the idea of this book is astonishing enough but the author has failed to make it successful his  vision of the future  reveals new york as the centre of the cult of the demetrian and other customs of the ancient greeks including their names and costumes henry t joyce who tells the story awakens to find himself confronted by a girl in greek dress she is lydia the woman who vowed and she introduces him to chairo cleon ariston and other incongruous inhabitants of the revolutionised american city lydia has decided to accept the call of demeter and naturally this scientific marriage is distasteful to chairo who is in love with her the lover eventually carries off lydia from the temple of the priests and after a few tame adventures is absolved from punishment and marries her of course the principal object of the author is to show us how collectivism and the cult of demeter would work in a world that had already tacitly accepted christianity and its rival religions he is too ambitious however for easy as it may be to repeat the copybook maxims of socialism it is quite another thing to reproduce them in a novel and make them appear real there is no genuine imagination shown in  the woman who vowedno distinction either in style or thoughtand it is not improved by the american spelling adopted throughout this may be a small point but the english reader with a reverence for the classics will scarcely approve of neaera of new york city  travelling  from one  centre  to another only a great writer could rise superior to the difficulties of this subject and ellison hardings attempt only convinces us that nature never intended greek culture to flourish in the western hemisphere  the woman wu vowed by g b burgin hutchinson  co this novel treating of the institution of a cult of demeter is intended to appeal to thoughtful men and women some of the advantages and disadvantages of the selection of specially endowed individuals and the voluntary election of the feminine among such to dispassionate motherhood are roughly indicated rather than precisely stated account is taken of the failure of selfless attempts to override natures apparently indiscriminate mating but we find no notice of some difficulties obvious to students of eugenics our author may of course hold that as society is depicted in this far future state a scientifically regulated health environment would remove some present dangers there are other solutions to problems of the day suggested but the lack of individuality in the book oppresses us,stories_contra

who has spoken them j and what wilt thou receive for tmthey are already paidthrough you and fflj own joy said he somewhat mortified it is mhey were only picturesand because he himjj now possessed more than pictures lie saw also wt the mother possessed more and that she had poken quite naturally and justly so he willingly lned thu alsothat a living work of god is  more value than all the works of men and that these only exist and can existbecause those are the calm is of short duration agnes relapses into her suspicions and envies the child its share in her husbands affection the minter resorts to the companionship of his ittle agnes as to an only solace she soon perceives the injustice which he suffers and the sense of it binds her more closely to her father what we are about to quote involves much that is distressing both in its detail and its suggestion the violence of albert is to be excused only by his sufferingif we forgive the illdirected hand it is because the mist of tears was in the eyes waiving these objections however all that succeeds is of exquisite beauty but the peelings of children are inconceivably delicate and just little agnes soon saw how unhappy her father was in his home how little he was valued albert had perceived and learnt first of all from her own mouth how much it grieved the loving little one to sec him so illused isle saw it also in her soft blue eyes but lie saw it meekly and silently when albert visited a friend one day against the inclinations of agnes who feared that be might perhaps complain of ber and thereby make public what appeared to ber quite allowable in privateand came home late that she might not be awake and yet found lier keeping watch with the child who had waited for her father that she might go to bed with himthen the mother scolded him and called him a waster of time and moneya man addicted to worldly pleasures while she toiled away for ever in secret at home and had never had a single happy hour with him thereupon he sat down and closed his eyes but tears may have secretly gushed forth from under his eyelids then the child sighed pressed bim and kissed him but said at the same time to lier mother in childish anger thou wilt one day bring down my father to the grave then thou wilt repent it everybody says sothe mother wished to tear her from his arms but he hindered ler wishing to punish his child himself these were the first blows he had ever given her thc child stood trembling and motionlessdo not beat her on my account certainly not on my account exclaimed agnes thus indirectly irritating him still more the father however struck but in the midst of the sadness and at the same time of the anger which his sufferings caused him he observed at length for the first time that bis little daughter had turned round between his knees and that he had struck her with a rough hand on the stomach he was horrorstruck he staggered away threw himself upon his bed and wept  wept quite inconsolably but the child came after him stood for a long time in silence then seized his handand besought him thus my father do not be angry  i shall so soon be well again my mother says thou hast done right come let nie pray and go to bed i have only waited for thee xow the little sandman comes to close my eyes come take me to thee i will certainly for the future remain silent as thou dost hearest thou  art thou asleep  dear fathertins danger then appeared to be overpast almost luckily might the guilty fathers heart say the little agnes had some time afterwards a dangerous fall  luckily  in order that bc might not further imagine that be was the cause of the childs death she continued sick from that day became worse and no physician could devise aught even wilibald who had studied seven years at padua and bologna only pressed thc hand of thc father that was intelligible enough all thc feelings of the mother were again roused the little agness birthday happened on thc holy christmas eve firmly resolved to have the little golden hood and thc white frock albert unknown to the mother had got them made in thc city and paid for thc birthday present shone in the twilight in the midst of the christinastree which had not yet been lighted up the mother saw it she stood confounded as well as deeply mortified and a remorse seized her which broke out almost into a rage against albert he wished to leave the room but at the door his knees failed him agnes hastened after him seized him supported him in her arms il i scolded him and wept with him while he sobbed and struggled in vain for composure she made him lie down then she lighted up the christmastree and the father saw but only as in a dream everything prepared when all was ready she said to him bring thy child and he did so but the joy of the child was extinguished she lifted up the little golden hood and the white frockbut scarcely smiled and hid herself on her father the angel at the lop of the christmastree took fire it blazed up and the child admired in her little hand the ashes of the angel and the remnant of tinsel from the wings during the night the child suddenly sat upright her father talked with her for a long time then she appeared to fall into a slumber but called again to him and said in a low voice  dear father father do not be angrywherefore should i be angry my child ah  thou wilt certainly be very angry tell me 1 pray thee what it isbut promise me firsthere thou hast my hand why then am i not to be angry ah father because i am dying but weep not weep not too much  my mother says thou needest thine eyes i would willinglyah  how willinglyremain with thee but i am dying dear child thou must not die  the suffering would be mine alonethen weep not thus thou hast already made me so sorryah so sorry  now i can no longer bear it therefore weep not knowest thou that when thou used to sit and paint and look so devout then the beautiful disciple whom thou didst paint for me stood always at thy side i saw him plainlynow i promise thee i will not weep said albert thou good little soul co hence and bespeak a habitation for me in our fathers house for thee and for mealbert now tried to smile and to appear composed again then agnes exclaimed behold there stands the apostle again  he beckons meshall i go away from theeoh father with strange curiosity albert looked shuddering around of course there was nothing to be seen but whilst he looked with tearful eyes into the dusky room only for the purpose of averting his looksthe lovely child had slumbered away the father hud all the childs little playthings into the coffin with herthat he and her mother might never more be reminded of lier by themthe little cods the angels the little lamb the little coat for the snowking and th little golden pots and plates over the whole moss and roseleaves thereon was she now bedded thus she lay her countenance white and pure for the mark the purple cross had disappeared with the blood from ber cheeks and now for the first time she had on the white frock and the golden hood encircled ber little head but not so close as to prevent a lock of her hair escaping from beneath the little incident of the white frock and the golden hood of which the child had been twice disappointed and which she wears only in her coffin is most touchingly introduced how many robes that life covets in vain are at last granted for a shroud shortly after the childs death albert quits his wife for a season during their separation agnes learns better to appreciate the claims of her husbandwhile he acquires still deeper patience for those infirmities which had still their root in her love it is the worthy aim of thc novelist to show that even the trials of genius are part of its educationthat its very wounds are furrows for its harvest with the development of this moral and the death of albert the story terminates what we have already said implies high praiseand our extracts will justify it but the volume is not exempt from the besetting errors of the german school ideas which might easily have been conveyed in simple and precise definitions are sometimes provokingly hidden under a veil of misty and elaborate phraseology the symbols by which the emotions and characters of the agents are indicated arc often so minute and unconnected as rather to demand an interpretation than to manifest a purpose allowing that much which seems affected arises from the difficulty of translating the idiomatic hi expressiveness of the original language into c foreign equivalents we yet find a serious residuum of manufactured subtlety and intentional  vagueness an imaginative work we admit   should not require didactic exposition it is  life in action and

first gentleman of his family by charles clarke in three volumes chapman and hall among the new race of novelwriters none gives promine of greater excellence than mr charles clarke his charlip thornhill published some eighteen or twenty months ago showed great power of writing freshness of thought and purity of purpose a box for the season though clever in its way as a photograph of bustling life was disappointing and now which is the winner  comes to prove that though mr clarke still limits himself to the description of those parts of english life in which he is most at home there is no monotony in his treatment of it and only so much sameness as is necessary in the steady setting forth of honour and honesty courtesy and pluck as essential to the character of a true gentleman mr clarke writes always as a man of education and refineiment his dialogue is racy and natural his narrative is easy and lifelike a good moral pervades all he writes but he has the wit to keep it in the background he is clever at the building up of a plot but he knows how to build it up of everyday materials and to avoid the exaggerations and improbabilities thought necessary to the interest of the newest sort of popular novels among the least unworthy of that sort are john marckmonts legacy ad the docrs wife but between them and such novels  which iw the winer  and charlie

moves in when it proves that the smaller fortune assigned to him hu by his fathers carelessness fallen into other hands he sets himself bravely to fight his own way in the world and at last shows that a prosperous banker albeit the dunce of the family can be as thorough a gentleman as one who follows the fashion of his anoestors in the hunting field and surpasses them on the race course that hunting and racing of the old sort are the manliest of english sports but that newmarket and goodwood are ceasing to be fit resorts for gentlemen unless they go as mere lookerson and that betting and playing as businesses are altogether blackguardly are the wholesome truths that mr clarke is most fond of enforcing no novelist is more at home in describing a huntbreakfast or a steeplechase and no one knows better where to draw the line between honourable and dishonourable sport we have rarely seen more piquant or accurate descriptions of countryhouse life or the holiday keeping of  good society which is the winner is a more finished novel than charlie tlwrnlhil concerned chiefly with the events of a year or two it has to do with the history of two families through three generations an old sir reginald carrington had mortgaged his sommerton estate the bulk of his property to henry bradfield a vulgar and bad man who had grown rich by help of mines and manufactures the mortgage was redeemed but old bradfield managed to rob sir reginald of the document containing the release and thereby frightened him to death therefore sommerton descends to abel bradfield and he does not know of his fathers fraud till longgrowing hatred of sir michael carrington the poor but haughty country gentleman heir to sir reginald makes him willing to maintain his wrongful possession as a way of revenge against his enemy as soon as he discovers the state of affairs he hunts for the document hidden long ago by his father intending to destroy it and with it all proof of the fraud but it falls by accident into the hands of his highprincipled son lawrence and when that son declares his determination to restore their property to the carringtons the elder bradfield storms himself into an apoplexy and so dies thereupon old wrongs are done away with and old jealousies are removed with the help of some lovemaking among the younger branches of the family the secrets of this lovemaking ought not to be told lawrence bradfield falls in love with evelyn carrington and his sister ellen has for one of her admirers stafford carrington evelyns sister besides these there is a lord mentmore

right people would not propose i oouldnt help that you know evelyn none of us can i could no more fall in love with the men who made love to me than you can with splinterbars its a great pity for he

not love even to please my father but i refused the man i did love and who loved me i bore it like an indian at the stake or rather like a shipwrecked sailor in sight of lad who refuses to be saved for the credit of his cloth i refused poor charley the old ladys eyes dropped all she had left of teas and i never told my father nor did he ever suspect that i had had an opportunity of doing so i how it is a noble nature that learns to bear well without crying out i tried it and failed i strove if not for victory for patient endurance but it was too much for me i endured torture upon torture and all the diversions of my age and the scenes through which i was hurried served to increase my pain i dot look it now der do i  its almost laughable to hear an old woman talk in thi way and then

about the story plays a very secondary part it is vague and disjointed standing still for a while and then going on with a start there is a murder and a villain who holds the strings by which he works other villainsthere are mysterious gipsies and blacklegs and an estate which seems to belong to two ownerslost documents and police officers and there is a hero who would be an excellent man if he did not gamble and who would be a rich man if he did not lose his money on every occasion indeed his purse seems to bleed at every pore and how he does not become a beggar is a miracle and there is a good younger brother who enters his uncles bankinghouse he is the dunce and sensible man of the 6tory and a very good fellow the framework of the story is weak but as readers will take up the book for the sake of the scenes of real life it is of not so much consequence where the author has worked on his own knowledge and experience the book is good the school scenes are especially pleasant and the general tone of the book is fresh it will be more acceptable to men than women because men do not care so much for a story as for detached scenes and those iu  charlie thornhill are very spirited and

afterwards and other stories short stokies by ian maclaren tl odder dc staughtonsomething too uniformly in the minor key are these short stories yet they are fairly true to life and will confirm the authors reputation for insight into character and a humour far removed from dr johnsons offensive merriment of parsons although domsie and dr davidson make edifying ends and so place themselves beyond the risk of further exploitation kate carnegie and other of our friends survive yet this is by no means especially a scottish collection the two other tales from the north being the minister of st bedes and the collectors inconsistency the former preceded by a sentimental tale of marital carelessness and unavailing regret which gives the title to the volume relates with some force the highland pride of a simple daughter of macdonald whose lowland lover is represented as likely to suffer socially by marriage with a rustic like herself in the latter as in several others we find a man of stiff exterior belie his acquired reputation by inward tenderness the collector is a converted englishman who has gone north in the service of the inland revenue and become scotis scotior he breaks down hopelessly in the presence of genuine calamity in a neighbours house and becomes as simple as your even christian among other ecclesiastical studies that of  father jinks is kindly and appreciative some tales are due to liverpool experience while  an impossible man leads his life of selfsacrifice in london suburban society dr watson has at length made an excursion beyond the kailyard with a moderate amount of success the stories from seven dials duckworth  co by edith ostlere are well invented and cleverly written but do not leave an effect of reality there is the usual brutal and sanguinary scene between women in which polly  scored her rivals face down halfadozen times with the iron hairpins in terrible ruts that gaped open half au inch deep   this sort of thing is overdone the men seem as a rule too sentimental and epigrammatic being shown in hours of domestioism and lovemaking without much hint of the prodigies of want and beggary which dickens found in seven dials the whole is effective rather than convincing we refuse to believe that  higher  is fairly represented by  ayer  in cockney dialect but wild spelling seems now a regular equipment of those who write about sordid streets of the fourteen stories contained in the collection entitled daughters of shem and other stories by samuel gordon greenberg  co there is not one that is weak or disappointing nearly all are tales of jewish life mostly in the western provinces of russia and tell the story of oppression and suffering from various points of view this is not however the predominant feature of the book there is throughout the volume a noticeable charm in the composition and in the method of describing character and scene which arises only from skill in writing the delineation of jewish domestic life is remarkable and the interest of the volume is well maintained throughout the first of the stories which gives the name to the collection occupies nearly a quarter of the whole book and it is a clever study of a subject which might well have occupied a separate volume with one exception the rest are on a much smaller scale but we can characterise all as having exceptional interest for the general reader as short stories go there is something above the average of interest in the collection entitled curios by richard marsh long they purport to narrate some of the adventures of t wo collectors of curiosities  and there is much to be learned of a certain meerschaum pipe a phonograph a boule cabinet an ikon a puzzle box a supposed great auks egg and the mysterious hand of a vanished lady we have read the stories that are respectively attached to these topics and find them very tolerable specimens of the storytellers art and they have the advantage of being written with taste and skill the only disadvantage that one may reasonably feel is that the subjects dealt with are hardly good enough for the care expended on them by the writer there are some illustrations provided by j a symington the author of  la neuvaine de colette  is a remarkable writer of short stories a volume named from one of themla main de saintemodestine by jeanne sohultz paris cal mann

maclarens recipe for pathos is a simple onea deathbed here are several extracts which show his manner of doing the thing in every case save the last they mark the climax of a story the last extract occurs at the first and lesser of two climaxes in the morning the doctor was still sitting in his big chair and skye was fondly licking a hand that would never again caress him   dr davidsons last

nurse for her attentions and just before he passed away she caught the words through much tribulation    euter the kingdom    god 4 righteous overmuch  she lay as she had died waiting for bis coming and the smile with which she had said his name was still on her face  afterwards  it will not we imagine be denied that these quotations disclose a certain monotony of means on the part of the author and indeed his effects throughout the book are of a facile and obvious order the most ambitious tales in the collection are afterwards and father jinks as regards the first we must admit that it makes a brazen appeal to the emotions the very bravado of its unnaturalness and improbability has a superficial air of artistic courage but not only does the importunate noise of it render it futile it fails in another way  the hero though ian maclaren does not seem to think so is an unredeemed cad with whom one cannot for an instant sympathise we fancy that  father jinks  was meant to be specially impressive to our mind it suffers from a clumsy arrangement and the culminating pathos is decidedly dragged in by the heels the book displays an aptitude for the short story form and an outlook upon the world which is wide and tolerant but rather selfconsciously so it does not however represent ian maclaren adequately,stories_contra
the lady in the car by william le queux eveleigh nash 6s mr le queux has been hailed by more than one literary reviewer as the master of sensation and mystery if such a title be deserved more than usual may be expected from a novel with mr le queuxs name on the titlepage in the present case it is to be feared that such expectations will be disappointed for the incidents which are grouped together under the title of  the lady in the car and in which the chief character is a certain bogus prince are of very ordinary merit either from the sensational or the mysterious standpoint viewed as single short stories in any of the more popular sixpenny monthly magazines any one of the chapters would serve to while away part of a tedious railway journey but reprinted in book form they are on a different plane and challenge more serious criticism and it must be admitted that this challenge is not justified that mr le queux can do much better than these stories he has proved again and again and it is a pity that he should choose to reproduce in a lasting form such ephemeral work the central idea of the stories is the career of a certain expublic school man who poses as a foreign prince and with the aid of quite a number of confederates commits various frauds and robberies the lady of the title is generally the dupe of the prince although in one or two cases it is a case of diamond cut diamond in the end the prince the parson the chauffeur and the rest of the gang are safely hidden somewhere that the author knows but the police do not and there we fancy the public will be quite content to let them rest,stories_contra

occasionally bursts of vivacity sometimes even brightening into brilliancy with some delicate touches of character but still thc incubus of heavy detail presses upon the mind of the reader until he comes to that part of the plot where the evidences of insanity in the head of the family begin to be apparent and then all is action energy and interest w e have thenceforward no more descriptions of long yellow gravel walks and short bright silk dresses we are no longer bored by being informed who took the arm of whom on the cheltenham parade and why that particular gentleman turned that particular corner in that very particular manner the characters of tin novel begin to walk on their path with dignity and to speak the language of passion all the parts are well adjusted the plot is dramatic and the language of the actors natural and to the point thc ingenuity by which the circumstantial evidence is made so irresistible cannot be too much commended the undoubting reliance of the

for other things from the same pen this book is in fact some way behind its best predecessors any coldness in our welcome is in proportion to the admiration generally excited by two or three of the earlier stories the authors very real knowledge of native life and native character in combination with the life and character of the dominant raco is still valuable here though even it has lost somewhat of its first freshness and directness of observation the present scenes and persons have less of the force and clearness of a first impression mrs steels writing was often a trifle faulty but the careless flurry of  the hosts of the lord is new our quarrel is however more decidedly with some of the studies of character they are inconsistently and even foolishly drawnone especially mrs steel has not escaped the present mania for introducing roman catholic priests in novels her ecclesiastic is quite an impossible person and she never for a moment helps us to forget it we are also unable though in a lesser degree to feel though reality of most of the other people they supply no overmastering interest calamities of all sorts are showered on their heads without moving us yet the incident is of an exciting kind it is the performers who are never up to its level though writers own manner is too excited and that is fatal obvious things are said as though they were anything rather than obvious  the effect of a picture or an attitude is spoiled by insisting on it too much many people appear for little or no purpose mrs campbells hopeless scotch and somebody elses useless irish are neither amusing nor instructive there are however many good points and the strain of oriental mysticism is well conveyed mrs steels work has been so excellent that her readers feel justly impatient when they see her decline on cheap effects and hasty workmanship  fiction the hosts of the lord by flora annie steel w heinemann 6s in reviewing mrs steels last novel voices in the night we resigned ourselves to the sad certainty that this truly gifted writer would never learn properly either to construct a novel or to write it we wilt not therefore dwell on the technical shortcomings of

look at it again after the lapse of time was an imitation of on the face of the waters in the hosts of the lord it would appear that by some default of inspiration mrs steel has given away the  trick  of her indian novels and this trick seems to be threefold a a melodramatic sentimental plot gathering slowly out of vagueness into one  big  situation b a crude juxtaposition of east and west done in a studiously blast manner as if to say these startling contrasts are nothing to me c theuse of catchphrases which may mean anything and nothing to touch briefly on these a he would be a clever man who after a single reading oould describe at all lucidly the plot of the hosts of the lord with its crowded figures and excrescent episodes but the mere titles of the chapters give a clue to its nature   driftwood  undercurrents  alpha and omega wheels within wheels echoes adrift trapped foiled the truth most of the trouble springs from the rivalry bf an aristocratic native and a thoroughly adelphio english jeune premier for the heart of an english girl whose grandmother was an indian princess side by side runs another and simpler lovestory between lance carlyon note the  penny novelette  quality of that name and a lady missionary looming over all there is an aged priest who speaks perfeot italian and fences better than the best fencer in the indian army then in the dim background are the hosts of pilgrims going to witness the aqueous miracle of the  cradle of the gods and the fifteen hundred malefactors of the big state prison where the  big situation  occursoccurs to the accompaniment of the inevitable thunderstorm what precisely are the  hosts of the lord  we cannot say b sometimes mrs steel contrasts east and west with considerable subtlety as in the admirable description of the viceregal durbar on pages 56 and 57 but more often the feat has the look of an ad captandum dodge faint and far they showed against the faint far sky but as father ninian pointed to them a ray of light from the still unseen sun below the visible horizon of this world a ray of light seeking perhaps another world among the stars found the heights of the holy hills in its path and

first love and last love new novels by james grant 3 vols koutledge  sons this is a good specimen of that particular commodity in the shape of novels which is so ably produced by mr grant to satisfy a large demand when we say that love and war are the chief ingredients of the story we are merely stating that mr grant is the author but we can fairly acknowledge that the writer has used his old materials with greater vigour and effect than we have seen of late and more in the style which gained him so much popularity in  the romance of war the indian mutiny the chosen theme here is a very good one for the class of romance required and we need scarcely say the subject does not lose in interest and excitement under the hands of mr grant all the horrors of those dreadful times are retold with a sufficient adherence to facts to sustain the readers interest with the knowledge that the majority of the scenes depicted really happened and yet with enough love and fiction to prevent the book becoming a mere history what we may call the fictional element is simply the history of a clergyman his three daughters and their lovers who were all living at delhi at the time of the outbreak of the mutiny to detail these adventures here is unnecessary it is sufficient to say that they are full of most exciting incidents and horrors with perhaps just a little too much of the latter to please an ordinary reader in fact there is scarcely a revolting detail of the awful deeds done in those days that is absent for if any special horror is not mentioned expressly it is so suggested that all can understand the allusion this is certainly a blemish on the work and one that may possibly make it very painful to many as it will not only recall the irreparable losses they suffered in the mutiny but also remind them of what they would willingly forgetthe terrible sufferings and indignities which accompanied the deaths of their friends as the author in the greater part of his novel is supposed to be recording facts he is bound to be very careful and see he does not j belie history we have not observed any very i serious mistakes  but this may be merely i because we have not searched very carefully for them and we are impressed with a notion that errors do exist from one piece of carelessness that caught our attention in describing the events that took place in delhi just after the rising and massacre there the mutineers are made to march through the city playing among other popular airs  slap bang here we are again however we do not wish to end a review of a wellwritten book by finding fault so we repeat with pleasure that this is certainly mr grants best production for many years and is sure to have a circulation through flood and flame 3 vols bentley we have here a domestic novel of some merit the tale is a very simple and homely one being merely the history of the nephew of a manufacturer who falls in love with one of his uncles workgirls the love is j ustified by the character and intelligence of the girl and is returned by her with equal passion but the uncle naturally objects to the match however a maiden lady gives the girl some thousands of pounds as a marriage portion with a view of overcoming the opposition of the uncle this has the desired effect and accordingly the pair are made happy for life the gift of a large sum of money in this fashion by a stranger is certainly a most improbable event and one that requires a good deal of confidence and courage to believe in but it is made as probable as such a circumstance ever can be and as it makes the right people happy a reader is not disposed to quarrel with it or examine its probability with a very critical eye the titlethrough flood and flame arises from the hero saving his love from the double perils of a flood and a fire the above outline may convey the idea of a dull and commonplace book but whatever faults it may have want of interest and originality are not among them the fact is the narrative simple as it is is worked out so well and with so true an adherence generally to nature that a reader is sure of entertainment and the author deserves considerable credit for making so good a novel out of such elementary materials there is moreover a fund of shrewd sense exhibited in the reflections of the writer which indicates a mind of no ordinary power and which forms no inconsiderable portion of the charm of the work some local characters are also exceedingly well drawn the ranting methodist parson of the manufacturing towns is an instance of this for his peculiar and very disagreeable characteristics are displayed with great vigourperhaps if anything with even an exaggerated power there are others equally out of the common way who strike a critic by their freshness to find a fault we should say the author is inclined to sermonise now and then and that he dwells on local peculiarities at the expense of his tale but these are faults easily

applauding much and approving of the whole though it treats of modern manners and ol the frivolous actors on a frivolous though lofty stage there is something very poetical grand and even awful in the construction of this tale in its commencement it is blithe with creations light gay and happy  the least is crowned with mirth wit sparkles and there is a sort of graceful revelry among perfumes and howers hut very early we see the serpent creeping from place to place withering everything by its trail a blight falls on these bowers of joy a wanness steals over the countenances of all and at last the drama closes in an atmosphere darkened by horrors and on a scene defiled by blood such is a general outline ol the  victims of society it is not only pathetic but eminently tragic though moral is biaoneil forth with a fearful vivid nesslike the hash of lightning felt through the closed the wilfully closed eyelids it tells distinctly to even the deafened ear of the sensuahst that indiscretion almost always leads to vice vice to crime crime most certainly to a neverfailing misery  and that each is the more difficult to retrace as it approaches the dread climax of woe that must terininate cither in despair or death hut to enter more into particulars we must tell the reader that the  victims of society are rather the vic tims of some of the errors that seem to be inseparable from it highly civilised society maybe compared to a rich soil and which if it were not rich could not produce so many goodly flowers and fruits  but this very richness will and must foster into a most rampant luxuriance all poisonbearing weeds to repress if they cannot wholly eradicate the latter is the office of the divine the legislator and the moralist society itself is not to blame if unfortunately some be thrown into contact with its henbane and its niirhtshade society strictly speaking has no victims but to the tr    vices inherent on it there are very many the whole scene of the story before us is laid in what is called high life the first and the most beautiful victim is the lady augusta vernon a radiant and loveable being and the sweetest of alf thc sacrifices when she is

lifes little ironies personality is the vital factor of things written on the force and charm of a writers individuality depend the power and appeal of his book skill in construction qualities of characterisation and phrasing the necessary technicalities are available to anyone who may use them but the individuality behind the personality that embues and controls is the influence that ultimately decides it is largely the cause of the quality and success of mr galsworthys writings a master of technique to the fingertips though rather inclined to overtouch and overdo he has a reserve of sympathy a human note that softens the harshest circumstance he can see the kinder side of the blackguards case and knows that to understand everything is to pardon he is moreover alert to irony and the combination of the ironic spirit with an unsubduable gentleness means that he can see can show the eternal humour of things but finds it impossible to laugh at the absurdities of pitiful humanity strung on the wires of the world with the screech of the gods these  five tales are ironic in a characteristically gentle manner we are shown old age confronting death and an inevitable disgrace with defiant blasts of cigar smoke and an absolute enjoyment of the ultimate sips of fatal liqueur brandy we see the hero on his silverwedding day brought by the imps of accident to ruminate by the roadside grave of her who six and twenty years before had killed herself because of his lost love cupids wings having been curbed and the blinded god lured to a suburban destination throughout the tales in some degree the little ironies of life are illustrated so that we are brought to realise how absolutely mans strutting and gesticulating importance is a marionette condition subject to the mechanism and whims of the immortals the only unconvincing story of the five is the first it is an account energetically and nervously wrought of an established barrister keith darrant who becomes an accessory after the fact to a murder virtuously committed by his weak and lovable younger brother laurence a woman who despite her trade is drawn sympathetically has become the victim of a loathly bully who exploits her for his own base purposes he is killed in a fury of passion suspicion however is fastened on another man who is subsequently condemned to death this proves too much for larry he leaves a confession and kills himself and then keith darrant destroys the confession for the poor purpose of   the leaf and other verses by r d norton langley  co i poems of love and war by lieut s b

the individuals of an infirm humanity there are persons who might let the innocent die rather than brave the passing contempt of the gossips but not this barrister trained in practice and by tradition to regard law order and even property as sacrosanct it would be impossible for such an one to destroy the evidence that saved an innocent man from death all else in the tale is admirable its erisimilitude is finely helped by the tense directness of the dialogue the second and the fifth stories are studies of old men taking the last sips of the wine of life before the cup is inevitably removed old heythorpe the chairman of a shipping company is a firstclass reprobate a scaramouche of distinction elaborately indifferent to the calendar of conventional virtues yet thanks to mr galsworthys sympathy we like the old dog and are a willing party to his nefarious doings and against the unpleasant decent people his justified persecutors the pity is that sylvanus could not bluff them at the last and was compelled to take refuge in the most tolerable of possible forms of suicide so also with number two jolyon forsyte we are glad to find was a friend of sylvanus heythorpe and though less of a practical desperado than he shared his love of good things liquid solid and feminine when the domestic watch dogs of his family were away the old fellow realised the indian summer of his life by befriending and enjoying the company of the divorced wife of his nephew again does mr galsvorthys kindness triumph over the harshness of reality indeed it looks very much as though the malefactors of the world they who have braved the censures of the formally good wvin the warmer share of his sympathy irene heron is an attractive woman who bears the consequences of her forbidden love with a modesty and courage that are admirable better such as she a thousand times than the coldly unkindly virtuous who narrow their conduct to the nice requirements of the decalogue as human instances these stories of old men vivid and vital are delightful artistically we could have wished that mr galsworthy had omitted the last paragraph of  a stoic  and the concluding two sentences of the  indian summer of a forsyte each is a case for suggestive reticence the silence that is more eloquent than speech  the juryman  is a sufficient fragment that points the consciousness of brotherhood between respectability and the criminal why is it the dock gapes for john and gets him while jonathan no less guilty but more happily circumstanced continues to wear the clean collar of a blameless life  henry bosengate is an eminently selfsatisfied citizen when he is called to act as juryman at the trial of little lewis the poor rat in khaki who because in the army he missed the affection of his wife had tried to kill himself if bosengate were treated as owen lewis had beenwell most of us are lucky to scape whipping  the apple tree  will probably be the best liked of these  five tales it is the one that loses most by mr galsworthys insistent gentleness it calls for a fierce irony its humoursatire demands merciless laughter its denoutement is actually cruel but not in the realisation the whole book is a joy for its feeling and artistry mr galsworthy is a master of his craft who plays on the keys of an intricate human existence with a deftness and sympathy that bring

since that green cover saw the light and number 1 less happy circles of listeners have been held in thrall by a reader a generation has passed away to many people sam weller is as old as strap or partridge and the pickwick club as quaint and antiquated as humphrey clinker mr dickens in fact has had the privilege of delighting two generations and it is not often that one writer can turn the privilege to such graceful account as mr dickens has done as sir bulwer lytton if we may still use the name by which lord lytton will always be best known after a course of many years of incessant labour wrote novels as fresh and vigorous as  pelham which lifted him to fame and honour when he was but a very young man so mr dickens shows that more than thirty years of work have only strengthened his faculties and that if he be now a veteran in the service he has with wellapplied experience as much as he ever had of the muscle strength grace facility and frankness of youth this fact is manifest even within the first five chapters of  the mystery of edwin drood there are some of mr dickenss critics who have never been able to see in him anything but a caricaturist they are of the nature of those censurers of homer who would deny all merit in the odyssey because of the comic portions of that marvellous poem that there is exaggeration in mr dickenss early sketches and a good deal of exaggeration in details of character in pickwick cannot be denied but these defects disappear in the brilliancy and truthfulness with which other characters are portrayed in the younger weller for instance there is humour without a trace of vulgarity and rare character as he now seems to be there was many a  boots  of those days who were not unlike him in his sayings and doings he is not theatrically got up he is redolent of the place where we first met him and though the eccentricities of halfadozen sharp witted  bootses  of his time are concentrated in sam he is nevertheless one of the characters nearest to truth in all mr dickenss creations as for sams father he seems perhaps to modern perceptions a queerer monster than his son but the survivors from among the young readers of the authors earliest literary time can very well remember that there was not a road on which stagecoaches ran in connexion with london that could not furnish  whips  whose philosophy and general ways of thinking and acting were exactly akin to those of the elder mr weller who spelled his name  with a wee my lord spell it with a wee we should not have been disposed to blame mr dickens if his series of typical characters had been exhausted but this mystery already shows that this is not the case the series seems to be inexhaustible and the authors skill in portraiture as great as of old with perhaps more delicacy and daintiness of touch there is equal power and grace in the description of the localities which are to be the scenes of his drama but they are in fact not scenes in a theatrical sense but real spots in the world which the reader readily identifies although the places exist only in the imagination which the author helps him to form of them very few of his readers know anything whatever of such a scene as that with which the story opens or to which it serves the office of brief prologue but there is such reality about it that the place and its inmates become familiar this effect is even stronger in the description of the cathedral city of cloisterhaman actually existing locality under an assumed name in any case it would be for the reader a genuine cathedral city with all its belongings a tourist would just now have some trouble perhaps if book in hand he were to try to identify the edifice described with the cathedrals he might visit for the purpose at gloucester for example the scaffolding of the repairers completely hides the choir at bath the  restorers are in full possession of the nave while at wellswhich is the nearest of the three to the cloisterham of mr dickens the vertical and horizontal poles of the beautifiers puzzle spectators of the most elaborate and beautiful of west fronts be this cloisterham where it may there the story fairly begins and soon plunges into both serious and comic business including one of the most original of lovescenes in which two young people ever took part we are not going to enlighten our readers on circumstances which they will prefer to make out for themselves we may however notice how in some of the descriptions mr dickens preserves certain of his wellknown agreeable mannerisms there is a certain complacent dean who does not walk across the close to his repast but directs his comely gaiters towards the ruddy diningroom of the snug old redbrick house where he is at present in residence with mrs dean and miss dean again the melodiously good minor canon the reverend septimus crisparkle does not leave a room like ordinary mortals but he withdraws his amiable face from the doorway and conveys it down stairs there is moreover a touch of the old boz humour in that exquisitely promising rosa bud who says to her equally promising affianced lover at the makingup after a little difference such as lovers vex and amuse themselves with no i cant kiss you because ive got an acidulated drop in my mouth in another way we are reminded of the old humour in the boy deputy who remarks of a drunkard whom he is cruelly flinging stones at as the latter leans helplessly against a wall he gives me a apenny to pelt him home if i ketches him out too late and this is not denied by the tippler who states that by giving the boy an object he enables him to earn threepence a week but touches like these are less characteristic of the artist than his power of wordpainting here is a little picture of the cathedral and the close which may remind some of killcanon corner when the wind and rain are beating pitilessly about it at wells not only is the day waning but the year the low sun is fiery and yet cold behind the monastery ruin and the virginia creeper on the cathedral wall has showered half its deepred leaves down on the pavement there has been rain this afternoon and a wintery shudder goes among the little pools on the cracked uneven flagstones and through the giant elmtrees as they shed a gust of tears their fallen leaves lie strewn thickly about some of these leaves in a timid rush seesanctuary within the low arched cathedral door but two men coming out resist them and cast them forth again with their feet this done one of the two locks the door with a goodly key and the other flits away with a folio music book the city itself is thus described in the authors picturesque fashion an ancient city cloisterham and no meet dwellingplace for any one with hankerings after the noisy world a monotonous silent city deriving an carthy flavour throughout from ito cathedral crypt and so abounding in vestiges of monastic graves that the cloisterham children grow small salad in the dust of abbots and abbesses and make dirtpies of nuns and friars while every ploughman in its outlying fields renders to once puissant lord treasurers archbishops bishops and suchlike the attention which the ogre in the storybook desired to render to his unbidden visitor and grinds their bones to make his bread a drowsy city cloisterham whose inhabitants seem to suppose with an inconsistency more strange than rare that all its changes lie behind it and that there are no more to come a queer moral to derive from antiquity yet older than any traceable antiquity so silent are the streets of cloisterham though prone to echo on the smallest provocation that of a summerday the sunblinds of its shops scarce dare to flap in the south wind while the sunbrowned tramps who pass along and stare quicken their limp a little that they may the sooner get beyond the confines of its oppressive respectability this is a feat not difficult of achievement seeing that the streets cf cloisterham city are little more than one narrow street by which you get into it and get out of it the rest being mostly disappointing yards with pumps in them and no thoroughfareexception made of the cathedralclose and a paved quaker settlement in colour and general conformation very like a quakeresss bonnet up in a shady corner in a word a city of another and a bygone time is cloisterham with its hoarse cathedral bell its hoarse rooks hovering about the cathedral tower its hoarser and less distinct rooks in the stalls far beneath fragments of old wall saints chapel chapterhouse convent and monastery have got incongruously or obstructively built into many of its houses and gardens much as kindred jumbled notions have become incorporated into many of its citizens minds all things in it are of the past even its single pawnbroker takes in no pledges nor has he for a long time but offers vainly an unredeemed stock for sale of which the costlier articles are dim and pale old watches apparently in a slow perspiration tarnished sugartongs wita ineffectual legs and odd volumes of dismal books the most abundant and the most agreeable evi dences of progressing life in cloisterham are the evidences of vegetable life in its many gardens even its drooping and despondent little theatre has its poor strip of garden receiving the foul fiend when he ducks from its stage into the infernal regions among scarlet beans or oystershells according to the season of the year the characters are etched as truthfully as the localities are painted we may all recognise miss twinkleton the lady governess of nuns house a  seminary for young ladies  miss twinkleton has two distinct and separate phases of being every night the moment the young ladies have retired to rest does miss twinkleton smarten up her curls a little brighten up her eyes a little and become a sprightlier miss twinkleton than the young ladies have ever seen every night at the same hour does miss twinkleton resume the topics of the previous night comprehending the tenderer scandal of cloisterham of which she has no knowledge whatever by day and references to a certain season at tunbridge wells airily called by miss twinkleton in this state of her existence  the wells notably the season wherein a certain finished gentleman compassionately called by miss twinkleton in this state of her existence  foolish mr porters revealed a homage of the heart whereof miss twinkleton in her scholastic state of existence is as ignorant as a granite pillar miss twinkletons companion in both states of existence and equally adaptable to either is one mrs tisher a deferential widow with a weak back a chronic sigh and a suppressed voice who looks after the young ladies wardrobes and leads them to infer that she has seen better days perhaps this is the reason why it is an article of faith with the servants handed down from race to race that the departed tisher waa a hairdresser in stronger lines still is drawn the portrait after life of a prominent man in cloisterham mr sapsea dresses at the dean has been bowed to for the dean in mistake has even been spoken to in the street as my lord under the impression that he was the bishop come down unexpectedly without his chaplain mr sapsea is very proud of this and of his voice and of his style he bas even in selling landed property tried the experiment of slightly intoning in his pulpit to make himself more like what he takes to be the genuine ecclesiastical article so in ending a sale by public auction mr sapsea finishes off with an air of bestowing a benediction on the assembled brokers which leaves the real deana modest and worthy gentlemanfar behind there is however a greater man than sapsea in cloisterhamthe cathedral mason and habitual toper but with humour and philosophy about him namely durdles who is broadly and vigorously limned  durdles is a stonemason chiefly in the gravestone tomb and monument way and wholly of their colour from head to foot no man is better known in cloisterham he is the chartered libertine of the place fame trumpets him a wonderful workmanwhich for aught that anybody knows he may be as he never works and a wonderful sotwhich everybody knows he is with the cathedral crypt he is better acquainted than any living authority it may even be than any dead one it is said that the intimacy of this acquaintance began in his habitually resorting to that secret place to lock out the cloisterham boypopulace and sleep off the fumes of liquor he having ready access to the cathedral as contractor for rough repairs be this as it may he does know much about it and in the demolition of impedimental fragments of wall buttress and pavement has seen strange sights he often speaks of himself in the third person perhaps being a little misty as to his own identity when be narrates perhaps impartially adopting the cloisterham nomenclature in reference to a character of acknowledged distinction thus he will say touching his strange sights durdles come upon the old chap in reference to a buried magnate of ancient time and high degree by striking right into the coffin with his pick the old chap gave durdles a look with his open eyes as much as to say is your name durdles why my man ive been waiting for you a devil of a time and then he turned to powder with a twofoot rule always in his pocket and a masons hammer all but always in his hand durdles goes continually sounding and tapping all about and about the cathedral and whenever he says to tope tope heres another old un in here tope announces it to the dean as an established discovery it is with reference to one of these ancient sleepers that mr durdles answers to a question put by jasper who is a principal character in the drama that is to be played out  theres a olden under the seventh pillar on the left as you go down the broken steps of the little underground chapel as formerly was i make him out so fur as ive made him out yet to be one of them old uns with a crook to judge from the size of the passages in the walls and of the steps and doors by which they come and went them crooks must have been a good deal in the way of the old uns two on em meeting promiscuous must have hitched one another by the mitre pretty often i should say without any endeavour to correct the literality of this opinion jasper surveys his companioncovered from head to foot with old mortar lime and stone gritas though he jasper were getting imbued with a romantic interest in his weird life yours is a curious existence without furnishing the least clue to the question whether he receives this as a compliment or as quite the reverse durdles gruffly answers  yours is another we leave the lovers to be studied by our readers they will find in them how a true artist can give novelty to an old theme and even give it altogether an original aspect the remarkable couple in this story are not a mere walking lady and gentleman but two people who immediately excite interest and with whom readers will be glad to meet often if these young folk be only as amusing and sympathystirring as they are here finally mr dickens has begun his new story in excellent vein a circumstance on which we may congratulate not only himself but the public generally  the mystery of edwin drood by thomas secconibe sir william robertson nicoll has broken 3out in a new place in the volume that he has just published on  the problem of edwin drood the first sentiment of many perhaps the majority of those who scan the title will be surely this subject might be allowed to take a longearned rest its place is in the mausoleum of literary curiosities along with speculations as to the dedication of shakespeares sonnets the authorship of the  eikon basilike or the identity of junius a large number of keen detective ninds have exercised themselves upon the problem as upon a sharpening strop most of them have written books or pamphlets on the subject and their lucubrations would fill a fairsized dwarf bookcase a few janatical dickensians may welcome any pretext for poring over the moiety of  edwin drood once more but the reader who does not take an active part in the dickensian fellowship may well regard with some coldness the appeal of a book which makes the reperusal of a fairly long and difficult though unfinished work a prior condition of complete understanding if the general reader is dissuaded by these prima facie considerations from the discussion of sir william nicolls latest work let us say at once that he will incur the risk of missing not only one of its authors most interesting productions but also one of the most considerable critical performances of recent years the books great achievement indeed is that it does not depend for its interest by any means exclusively upon the discovery of x in the matter of the specific solution of the edwin drood mystery the present deponent at any rate found an interest of no secondary kind in its pages as an investigation of the testimony as to all the circumstances attending the production of dickenss latest work it abounds in documentary evidence it reveals with singular suggestiveness the evolution of dickenss latest manner it brings us nearer  dickensthe last phase than any book we can remember to have read with mr lehmanns admirable book on  dickens as an editor  it goes far to vindicate the reality of national gratitude to the great novelist now in his hundredth year battered by life and worn by the many leagues of print which he had traversed dickens had indeed journeyed far from  pou sto  of  nicholas nickleby  and  oliver twist one may not be able to agree with the writer that  edwin drood  is one of the best of his works an analogy is employed between some elements in  drood  and in  hunted down the parallel is rather damning to the unfinished work of i87o  a more melodramatic theatrical and unsatisfactory short story than  hunted down  would be hard to discover among the works of the reprinted the bloom and the flush of dickenss wonderful morning had evaporated long before the day of  edwin drood his style had lost every scrap of that wonderful simplicity and eighteenth century rotundity so remarkable in his first great successes the marvel is that it should have acquired so many new qualities of distinction   the problem of edwin drood a study in the methods of dickens by sir w robertson nicoll 3a 6d net hodder  stoughton the opening passage in the second chapter df  edwi1 drood for instance is a far more elaborate piece of prose than dickens could have possibly imagined in his impressionable youth yet how bright that wonderful eve still is how little undimmed that marvellous vision and that amazingly vivid power of portrayal for sheer writing power in mere force of description how many authors are there of any age who can stand up against it  if a descriptive critic of today wants a new subject a terra incognita let him write about the early and undiscovered plots of dickens nobody marks them at the time of reading a propos of his inquiries here our author makes a few remarkable discoveries about them the plots of most of the novels indeed from  barnaby rudge  to  our mutual friend are fearful and wonderful things a monograph might be written we cannot asseverate that it would be read about each one of them but the plot of  edwin drood stands apart it seems from most if not all of them it is a thoroughly hlrid and melodramatic plot but it does possess a certain interest of its own and it does reflect a considerable amount of interest upon the characters for dickens this is a novelty with a vengeance  in most of his books the plot appears like some malignant parasite draining the life blood of the parent stem of character in  drood  the plot has an independent life of its own faith in wilkie collins which had germinated a dozen years ago had now born ripe fruit without professing in the least to be an expert on this thorny question i must say that sir williams solution seems to me eminently sane and satisfying in the first place it is extremely tentative and unaggressive in the second it is based broadly and munmistakably upon the irrefragable testimony of forster forster with all his faults remained to the very end dickenss chosen biographer and confidante the suggestion that the great man deliberately misled forster as to the general tendency of the tale is inadmissible forsters hints therefore must form the nucleus of anv really judicial summingup of the matter the first object of the bench is to cut away the tangled and luxuriant overgrowth of baseless theory when this is done and a few careful qualifications cautiously made it seems to me that we have a solution approximate enough for the purposes of any reasonable curiosity the testimony of the illustrator sir luke fildes so far as it goes is absolutely corroborative of the biographer everything points to the conclusion that the villain jasper tried to murder his nephew edwin by strangling him with a black scarf that dickens intended that the wicked uncle should have succeeded in his intention seems to me equally certain jasper had premeditated and rehearsed the murder in the opium den the motive was the fierce and wolfish passion for edwins betrothed this passion revealed finely in one of the original illustrations was cloaked by a most revolting duplicity jasper says our author was  an unredeemed vllin he was anything but a fool he drugged drood he strangled him he put his body in quicklime he had time to rob the victim of his jewellery but for one unknown recently acquired ring which was ultimately to prove the piece de convictioni he maintained a threatening and defiant attitude he had done his business w e are to imagine him working with a hydelike malevolence suggested by his ebullitions against the urchin deputy in a night of the wildest tempest he is a new type of villain rather for dickens and a far more successful one than the tvpicallv dickensian wholly incredible carker his passion too is a new element revealing a considerable change as it seems to us in dickenss moral perspective the gradual determination to criminal motives which set in only after the first efflorescence of his genius seems to arrive at its climax in the lurid plot of  edwin drood the theory that edwin after all was not dead and was to appear in the eleventh or twelfth part redivivus seems to me untenable there is no iota of evidence to support it and the only two pleas in its favour are first that it was rather contrary to dickenss method to destroy a  title  secondly the suggestion conveyed by the design at the foot of the original green wrapper our author is not at his happiest i think in his description and elucidation of these designs but he makes the essential point namely that they are not to be taken too closely or literally they are rude hieroglyphics and like zadkiels are to be interpreted with the eye of faith after taking immense pains to construct and conceal an elaborate mystery it was hardly likely that dickens was going to give it away on the cover as to the mode of death there seems to me no evading the express statement made by dickens to his illustrator that lie must have a long black scarf for edwin to be strangled  ith as regards jaspers ejaculations in the opium den look down look down too much imptortance need not be attached to them miss stoddarts suggestion on this point seems quite adequate the idea of flinging edwin from the tower may have occurred to jasper and been abandoned highly probable too is her speculation that the sapsea monument was to be the destination of the murdered mans remains jasper may have conveyed some quicklime into that spacious receptacle before depositing the body there there was ample opportunity for such operations in the midnight solitude of the precincts these outlines seem fairly meritable but the precise manner in which the discovery was to be worked out must remain dickenss secret the ring the opium woman princess puffer durdles datchery and the deputy and finally the suspicions of mr rewgrious were evidently to be the main instruments of conviction rewgious whose first appearance is so impossibly grotesque but who improves so steadily upon acquaintance was in my opinion to play a most conspicuous part tartar of course marries rosa and crisparkle helena neville it seems was to be spirited away probably killed in the act of bringing the  wicked man  to justice all this part of his thesis sir william appears to prove to our complete satisfaction far more than any of his predecessors he has gone into the question of manuscripts interlineations and erasures as he recapitulates these we cannot help repeating what is he going to make of all this  nothing however could be more satisfactory than the way in which every ounce of this evidence is made to fit into its place and to tell upon the volume and weight of the converging mass of proof this part of the book is an admirable illustration of the judicial method when it comes to the question of  who is datchery  the case is altered dickens left no clues here of an external kind everything depends upon the ingenuity of the commentators and much if not most of this ingenuity seems to us hopelessly misplaced nor can we wholly exempt sir william from this indictment his theory that datchery is helena is certainly one of the best and the best sustained it is far more plausible for instance than the incredible proposition that datchery is drood himself both suppositions seem to me to impugn the sanity of dickens as an artist our interpreter uses the erasures and interlineations here with an almost uncanny cleverness yet after all his exertions the case seems to us less than  not proven that an artist of dickenss calibre should be reduced to such a pitiable artifice as a maleimpersonator is to us a thing too painful to contemplate the explanation of datchery saying to himself be it remembered   i like the old tavern way of keeping scores  is a marvel of literary gymnastic but after all  it will not do i am inclined to think that datchery was a new character and an emissary of grewgious probably some sort of relation and no more he is a melodramatic figure at best that is enough without representing him as a young and beautiful woman masquerading as an amateur detective and consuming brown sherry and mutton chops  our author himself im inclined to think has a slight revulsion of feeling from the strain of such a conjecture at any rate he refers to it not at all in his concluding chapter which is a most admirable drawing together of the various lines of evidence conjecture and parallel in what will prove we are convinced to the multitude of readers one of the most repaying books on the subject of charles dickens that the century of his fame has yet produced,storie

stories of waterloo complete in 1 volume standard novels bentley we have made our first acquaintance with these tales in this convenient republication and a very agreeable acquaintance we have found it the book deserves a better title the stories are no more stories of the field of waterloo so exhausted of interest than the canterbury tales are tales of the city of canterbury the storytellers are soldiers but the subjects are not professional they belong to human life generally indeed the great merit of the work consists in showing what we will call the plainclothes side of the military character the careless soldier has his story of sentiment and sorrow the gay devilmaycare fellow has a memory stored with thoughts of tenderness and the boldest breast confesses the keenest sensibilities withal there is no maudlin all is manly and what it becomes men to feel and to say they feel a generosity of sentiment runs throughout which gives a cordial zest to a volume of great entertainment the reader feels that he is amused with a thing of the right grain  stories of watrloo and other tatu in 8 vots post 8vo the vivacity pleasantry and polish of military society is familiar to those who have mixed in it and when officers write it is not like a schoolboys theme or a savaugs dissertation a style de conveneaz a noblesse convenue des mots but ideas which are apropbs in the manner of drawingroom conversation and most felicitous in figure and expression a military man is in the field a philosopher who despises death in private life an elegant voluptuary we have had occasion to notice this subject of military books before and we shall not repeat our observations we have therefore only to say that the interest which desdemona expressed for the heroic acts of othello applies to these delightful volumes the plays of shakspeare especially please because there is an uncommon variety in the characters andincidents and the reflections and sentiments are quotations from life a book which every body has read now these volumes are written upon the same shakspearian principles of variety of character and natural circumstances exhibited veluti ix speculo la other words these tales are plays or tragedy melodrame comedy and farcethe battle of waterloo and other public events forming the scenery processions and similar grand stageaccompaniinents the taste of the author is of the first character for as a gentleman and man of the world he never preaches or rails nor does he go beyond dry humour except in the story of colonel wilson i 302 306 where he expresses abhorrence at the roguery andblasphemy of certain tartuffes and cantwells who had made of a baronets seat a publichouse for all sionbound travellers i 289 usurped the authority of the master and deprived his relatives of a home a case by no means uncommon where property is in the hands of weak people so many extracts from this feast of tales have been published in various periodicals that we can no more fix upon good things not already shown and advertised than we can upon a questionwhich is the greatest beauty at a ball where there are many beauties a judgement of paris is not so palpable a thing as a choice of hercules and in such circumstances the wisest act is to leave the decision to individual taste we cannot quote reflectious for it is not a work which philosophises or sermonizes but the characters are hieroglyphics that interpret themselves and give the best lessons of instruction in knowledge of life brilliant and military manners and elevated sentiment the pictures of hibernian character are perfect hogarths and we shall give an extract which would make a painting worthy that inimitable master it refers to an assemblage at the door of an

pawnee hero stories and folk  tales with notes on the origin customs and character of the pawnee people by g b grinnell to which is added a chapter on the pawnee language by john b dunbar nutt  blackfoot lodge tales the story of a prairie people by g b grinnell same publisher tne pawnee tribe ocaupied the banks of the platte river in nebraska where now stands the flourishing city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has several woodcut illustrations,storie

  stories and interludes by barry pain henry kr barry pains mannerisms obscure his matter this is the besetting sin of the new humorists among whom he is an industrious producer they veil commonplace thoughts hy describing them in terms that belong by right to some other thought the interchange of terms produces  style being aggressively unconventional they prefer a dash of  bitter  to the olympian nectar of pure laughter for the fuller presentation of slight plots and crude philosophies they create some new species of children animals and inanimate objects answering to the old names but possessing the hothouse emotions attributed to civilised men and women moreover they never disclose the crises of their stories their heroes spend supreme moments in a privacy from whioh the philistine reader is most rigidly excluded this is a stage trick they learned of mr henry james who also supplied them with a certain attitude of cold superiority whioh suits only a very few writers it seems to me that their inadequate suggestiveness is admirably satirised in the ideal with which mr pain has inspired his girlchild sybil if you couldnt kiss mecouldnt anyhow and yet somehow did i believe that would be something like it mr pain himself possesses a peculiar genius for expressing ideas with infelicitous originality and misusing poetical similes after the manner of his own millicent marshe who said that merle had  a strange way of looking at one sometimes as if he were thirsty perhaps the most striking examples in this volume are  that nauseous wholesome affection you have for your dog or your father   and the closing phrase of a nightingales song to be beloved is the only joy and to love is the only sorrow hut the miracle that passes music comes when that joy and sorrow meet the silence of it is silence on fire this must be one of the  roaring impossible silences  to which mr w e henley refers in his last volume mr pain indeed is frequently strained in his sympathy with nonhuman things thus we read that a friend of his was  smoking mitigated latakia and latakia has a way of rolling itself all round the atmosphere and kicking another was wandering in the garden and  a shy wind redlipped as i fancied from secret kisses of the flowerscame stealing out as if it had been afraid to come by day lest it should meet people who would not understand itand so on around a third the beautiful enid clung a barbaric dress which  loved her and went the way that made her most impressive such are some of the characteristics of mr pains style his fault as a storyteller is a tendency to kill off everyone at the end we should have attributed this to a want of inventiveness if he had not stated that it was the natural consequence of youthful optimism  to die is easy as he remarks and i havo often wondered that those who would write a pathetic story will make it end with death yet again his pathos is sometimes produced by this means he writes with an air of unlimited experience of life and deals largely in generalisations he is almost as omniscient as mr rudyard kipling for instance the statement that  the only real things in life are the things which exist solely in the imagination  is the sweeping moral of the story of the prince who went mad because he could not forget that he might die at any moment and in so doing exposed the weakness of a certain theological doctrine then it is surely unnecessary for mr pain to have borrowed from hawthornes story of the prophesying portraitpainter or to repeat his own inventions twice in this short volume his heroes reach the point where  there are no more discoveries to make  in their wives natures while the lady in  the glass of supreme moments  and the mechanism of  exchange  are practically repetitions of different parts of  the celestial grocery we have said nothing of mr pains verse interludes because in them his power of expression is cramped by the restrictions of rhythm but stories and interludes is after all well worth reading mr pain has invented a variety of plots though as we have soon he cannot always find his way out of them he has the capacity of interpreting human characters and the moods of nature isle is genuinely humorous when he leaves the fashion of egotism in composition and some of the pieces in this volume are almost entirely natural and unaffected by far the best is  rural simplicity in which the writers personality is never obtruded it is free from his usual mannerisms and is written with quiet unstrained humour in a simple and effective style the observation of character is professedly superficial but admirable so far as it goes and we hope that he may produce more tales of the samo kind reginald brimley johnson,storie
great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,storie

wideawake stories a collection of tales told by little children between sunset and 8unrise in the panjab and kashmir by f a steel and r c temple bombay education societys press london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the thief in consequence of his too grasping stipulation loses both eyes falls into a well and is drowned nos 3139 give in a readable form a number of the stories about raja rasalu the chief legendary

afterwards and other stories short stokies by ian maclaren tl odder dc staughtonsomething too uniformly in the minor key are these short stories yet they are fairly true to life and will confirm the authors reputation for insight into character and a humour far removed from dr johnsons offensive merriment of parsons although domsie and dr davidson make edifying ends and so place themselves beyond the risk of further exploitation kate carnegie and other of our friends survive yet this is by no means especially a scottish collection the two other tales from the north being the minister of st bedes and the collectors inconsistency the former preceded by a sentimental tale of marital carelessness and unavailing regret which gives the title to the volume relates with some force the highland pride of a simple daughter of macdonald whose lowland lover is represented as likely to suffer socially by marriage with a rustic like herself in the latter as in several others we find a man of stiff exterior belie his acquired reputation by inward tenderness the collector is a converted englishman who has gone north in the service of the inland revenue and become scotis scotior he breaks down hopelessly in the presence of genuine calamity in a neighbours house and becomes as simple as your even christian among other ecclesiastical studies that of  father jinks is kindly and appreciative some tales are due to liverpool experience while  an impossible man leads his life of selfsacrifice in london suburban society dr watson has at length made an excursion beyond the kailyard with a moderate amount of success the stories from seven dials duckworth  co by edith ostlere are well invented and cleverly written but do not leave an effect of reality there is the usual brutal and sanguinary scene between women in which polly  scored her rivals face down halfadozen times with the iron hairpins in terrible ruts that gaped open half au inch deep   this sort of thing is overdone the men seem as a rule too sentimental and epigrammatic being shown in hours of domestioism and lovemaking without much hint of the prodigies of want and beggary which dickens found in seven dials the whole is effective rather than convincing we refuse to believe that  higher  is fairly represented by  ayer  in cockney dialect but wild spelling seems now a regular equipment of those who write about sordid streets of the fourteen stories contained in the collection entitled daughters of shem and other stories by samuel gordon greenberg  co there is not one that is weak or disappointing nearly all are tales of jewish life mostly in the western provinces of russia and tell the story of oppression and suffering from various points of view this is not however the predominant feature of the book there is throughout the volume a noticeable charm in the composition and in the method of describing character and scene which arises only from skill in writing the delineation of jewish domestic life is remarkable and the interest of the volume is well maintained throughout the first of the stories which gives the name to the collection occupies nearly a quarter of the whole book and it is a clever study of a subject which might well have occupied a separate volume with one exception the rest are on a much smaller scale but we can characterise all as having exceptional interest for the general reader as short stories go there is something above the average of interest in the collection entitled curios by richard marsh long they purport to narrate some of the adventures of t wo collectors of curiosities  and there is much to be learned of a certain meerschaum pipe a phonograph a boule cabinet an ikon a puzzle box a supposed great auks egg and the mysterious hand of a vanished lady we have read the stories that are respectively attached to these topics and find them very tolerable specimens of the storytellers art and they have the advantage of being written with taste and skill the only disadvantage that one may reasonably feel is that the subjects dealt with are hardly good enough for the care expended on them by the writer there are some illustrations provided by j a symington the author of  la neuvaine de colette  is a remarkable writer of short stories a volume named from one of themla main de saintemodestine by jeanne sohultz paris cal mann

occurs at the first and lesser of two climaxes in the morning the doctor was still sitting in his big chair and skye was fondly licking a hand that would never again caress him   dr davidsons last

and the smile with which she had said his name was still on her face  afterwards  it will not we imagine be denied that these quotations disclose a certain monotony of means on the part of the author and indeed his effects throughout the book are of a facile and obvious order the most ambitious tales in the collection are afterwards and father jinks as regards the first we must admit that it makes a brazen appeal to the emotions the very bravado of its unnaturalness and improbability has a superficial air of artistic courage but not only does the importunate noise of it render it futile it fails in another way  the hero though ian maclaren does not seem to think so is an unredeemed cad with whom one cannot for an instant sympathise we fancy that  father jinks  was meant to be specially impressive to our mind it suffers from a clumsy arrangement and the culminating pathos is decidedly dragged in by the heels the book displays an aptitude for the short story form and an outlook upon the world which is wide and tolerant but rather selfconsciously so it does not however represent ian maclaren adequately,storie

the diary of a superfluous man and other stories by ivan turgenev translated from the tlr    rv  v russian by constance garnett heinemann the five stories contained in this volume belong to the earliest period of the literary activity of tourguenief in fact one of them andrei kolosov was his first tale they are fresh and vigorous and have the stamp of youth upon them the men and women are of the types which the great novelist loved to draw no one is fonder of making the main facts of life depend upon trivial incidents no one sketches the fatalism in our existence with a more disdainful realism in  the diary of a superfluous man the hero is baffled at every step of his career in 4 takov pasinkov misunderstandings of a petty nature wreck peoples lives and in  andrei kolosov and a correspondence what seem great and noble attachments are ruined by trivial and unworthy passions the last two of these tales remind us of spring torrents which has already been translated by mrs garnett the moral may be expressed in the words of tennyson we are puppets man in bis pride and woman fair in ber flower the deathbed scenes are drawn by tourguenief with appalling realism the advice at the conclusion of the last tale is wonderfully pathetic and suggestive  remember life deceives all but him who does not reflect upon her and demanding nothing of her accepts serenely her few gifts and serenely makes the most of them go forward while you can but if your strength fail you sit by the wayside and watch those that pass by without anger or envy they too have not far to go we have nothing but praise for mrs garnetts version and hope that these translations may drive most of their rivals out of the field in this country here and there a note might be supplied as on repetilov and fet on p 309 it should be  in the chiaja  a street in naples as it stands in the translation it looks as if some town or village were specified  notes on novels  these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the diary of a superfluous man by ivan turgenev this is the thirteenth volume in mrs garnetts translation of the russian novelist two more are to follow both made up of his short stories and the work will be complete in december in addition to the title story the present volume contains   a tour in the forest  yakov pasinov andrei kolosov and  a correspondence heinemann 3s 6d,storie
82 one hundred fables orirtnal and se lectcd by james northcote ra em bellished with 280 engravings an wood lawford mr northcote will forgive us if in noticing his very beautiful vo lume our first attention is directed to the embellishments by which it is en riched  and we have the less reason for an apology on this occasion as the original invention and design of the prints at the head of each fable are his own thee are engraved on wood iu a style of elegance and grace superior to any thing we ever saw or that we deemed practicable in this branch of art the expression in many of the animals introduced is wonderful and the various passions by which they are supposed to be influenced are completely depicted in all their excita tion some of the vignettes and tail pieces are perfect gems and contain in themselves very apposite morals to the fables to which they are appended of the literary part of the volume we have but little to say in praise and we have nothing to say in the way of blame there is but little originality in the construction of the fables and the moral is too frequently on the surface but the end purposed is always virtuous although the apo thegm may be selfevident or trite perhaps the prevailing defect is the ab sense of invention but we have no disposition to grumble if we do not recognise in mr northcote the shrewd ness of iesop or the playfulness of gay we have enough to show ns that he has a sound perception of what is upright in conduct and virtuous in morals and no man can read half a dozen of these fables without the con viction of the good intentions of the author the volume is dedicated to the king and whether in reference to the beauty of its pictorial embellishments or for the justness of its moral precepts is not unworthy such illustrious patron age,storie

longman and co j oi the design of this work we cordially ap prove  and are sure if the author will only take time and look well about him he mav  make as interesting a series of family anil 1 louendary stories as the reader for entertainmont could desire but he must not hurry  on without consulting the curious data which i abound on such subjects as he has undertaken to illustrate and he must not exercise ini volition too much in a publication the title i of which teaciies us to expect ancient mate rial and memorable tradition we are inj dneed to outer this caveat because we do not j think that  the priors of lawford a tale j which occupies above 200 pages of the second j volume whatever may be its merits in other respects conies within the scope and spirit of though plan as announced by the author the origin of the hays the union of the families of halliday and macdonald the anecdotes and feuds of the forbeses ami gordons the  three maids of loudon and  the johnstons of fairlyall the other pieces  are consistent with the design and we only regret that such a slice out of the  dominies legacy should have been found necessary to eke out the volumes the style adopted hy mr picken may be designated as  gaits scotch  that is doric enough hut also marked by the coinage of words and phrases the meaning of which is tolerably obvious but which in fact belong to no language under the sun where for ex ample could we hear of the  pruriencies of a father or the u sexualities of a lover except in writings of this class  many of the notes relate to remarkable events and the tales we have enumerated are j various and amusing the  johnstons of  fairly is the most descriptive of rustic manners and the most highly wrought in tragic incident mr picken succeeds best in the latter for in spite of his apology we are deeply affected by the finale of this pathetic drama though we cannot laugh at the homely scenes of vulgar merriment they have however though merit of being cleverly represented and with truth to old customs it is difficult to quote from a production of this kind  we shall however begin with a sample of the notes  forbes of pitnacaddel and his many ecccntricities are still celebrated by tradition ia strathdon the laird was religiously inclined and taking on to college education in his youth besides being proprietor of a good estate he became the minister of his own parish but being like king david a valiant man he determined that his clerical duties should not interfere with the  rights and reasons of a highland laird and he insisted on preaching imho full costume of the claa philibeg and all with a great baskethilted sword by his side when taken to task for this innovation mum the regular canonicals of john alvin  the time being long before the disarming act he defended his conduct by three reasons diiili were the following st that though a iwicher he was a gentleman and so entitled ta wear arms whenever and wherever he isiil jd that he carried a sword because it knew how to use it and hi that if any inn doubted these premises they might put jilin to these proof whenever they chose such reasoning as this was decisive in the highlands isptvially when backed by  college lair and a strong arm  and it appears to have been irre successful than his assertions in bis clerical calling for being an ultra calvinist even unto the borders of antiiiomiauism in inulidiing from the pulpit against the hereticd doctrine of  good workshe is said to lave exclaimed  ve will be doing fatt the dell can ye do  do  and bc dummied   our

the common iitiilens of her country a plain lawn keriiil covering her shoulders was crossed moihstly on her bosom instead of thc velvet and rails that had once blazed from it with costly i iltiitifiiice  and her person now setting ito a married womans fulness was chid in ililli gingham like a decent farmers wife  watched behind the hedge with beating hhiis lor the recollections of

some sheaves of corn  anl when he took oil his hat to ask a blessing on the repast his thick black hair clustering round his sunburnt temples and wiped with his sleeve the healthy perspiration from his brow and looked fondly and gratefully in his barbaras face as he took the bread and milk from her hands i thought i never saw a handsomer rustic pair they ate their meal with a pleasant countenance and did not discourage the joke and jeer of rustic fun that went round among the reapers and as the latter rose to return to their work i saw a tear steal down barbaras cheek as with some strange emotion she gazed upon her husband  while when the reapers had gone he placet his arm kindly round her waist as il to acknowledge in love and kindness that this was a moment of real happiness soon however does it vanish  the lady is seduced from her husband and child and for a season leads a life of dishonour and here is the contrast   james johnston went about the cauld rigs ofthe mailing a perfect object of brokendown manhood suffering and despondency th only consolation he appeared to take in life was in the nursing and tending of his little laugh ter but providence in its mystery seemed to have set its mark upon him for even this last tie to the world was threatened next to be torn out of his shattered heart the winter time had set in cauld and grim and a lonely blackness seemed to brood over the ntlhbourhood of leafless carloghie when one dark night towards the middle watches a solitary figure of a woman came stealing towards the farmhouse of reen braes she was dressed richly for a pedestrian yet there was in her appearance and manner au air of wild and rockless dilapidation she sought the window where she saw a light burning i need not say this was the once handsome and proud lady barbara of carloghie with hesitating steps and rising emotion she drew near to the little window there was no screen and she looked in as well as her blinded eyes would allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is far away with them that never loved her as i have done  and now thou art her last saddest remembrancer and cold deaths creeping up to thy young heartand 1 am a bereft and brokenhearted man he stopped suddenly choked by his sorrow and thought he heard a noise without it was barbara groping agitatedly for the latch of the door the sounds were low but became shaip and abrupt and the door moved as if the walking spirit of death sought hasty admission in another instant the figure of a female wanderer stood before him and the pale and haggard countenance of bis own barbara appeared by thc dim light ofthe small lamp more like a deadly ghost than a living being k it is indeed barbara herself she said after gazing ionland sadly in his altered countenance come to lay her head beneath your feet fames

husband  yell no put nie out at this door till ny puir bairn wins to her last rest  till the breaths out ol marys body said james  ye may sit there and greet by her side but yeve done us bitter wrong lady babby as ye truly say and another night ye shall never abide under my roof the two parents sat and watched the dying child and at times between their sobs ol sorrow stole a nameless look at each others faces at length in the darkest hour that comes before the break of the morning the pretty bairn gasped its last and was relieved from the troubles of an uncertain world nothing was saidnothing could be spoken as the women that waited without came iu to compose the limbs of the child  its over now and my deeds done said lady barbara rising  it is not fit that i should sit longer in an honest mans house with a steady stop she walked tow ards the door and ere the light of morning lind opened out fairly upon the breaking sky her figure had vanished beyond the fields of the farm and no one inquired whither she went     the fairly kirkyard where mary johnston was buried is pleasantly situated a little above the rtiar water whore the bridge crosses off towards carloghie castle on the night after the funeral james johnston was a  restless mau  and when his frit nils looked in  his pale face and wandering eye they shook their heads and said that it would be well if nothing fearful should happen when the darkness came on however he found himself unable to stay in his house and made his way towards the kirkyard to try to get relief by indulging his sorrow oer his daughters grave it was dark as pitch by the time he entered the little stile and groping among the tomb stones he could not readily find the spot where his bairn lay isle had just found the green mould and the loose sods when seating himself down upon a broad stone lie saw something move between himself and the starless sky but quite near on the oilier side of the grave  who is there  he called out with some terror  is there any ono watching in this dreary kirkyard that can have griefs to bear equal to mine  k deeper deeper and sadder far janies johnston  said i faint womans voice  for the grief of guilt and the bitterness ol shaine are a heavier load on the crushed heart than aught that can come of fair misfortune but keep up your mind  you suffer not at leist the pangs of remorse for having brought the virtuous into calamity  barbara he said affected into mildness by her penitent speech  i wish you had not come here from wherever you caine to interrupt my communion with the harmless dead my wounds are oer green and my mind oer distraught for meeting you so soon after what has happened she sobbed latterly as he spoke but replied not and both sat over the grave weeping in silence  will you

frozen to hope and the world and you come here to embitter anti disturb my most painful thoughts she still did not seem able to make a reply and the dead silence of the solitary churchyard was only

short stories dunky fitlow by a e coppard cape 7s 6d among contemporary writers of the short story there are few whose work has been so consistently exciting and disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it there for it renews ones hopes in mr copards future mrrk i il e vam  short sto ries by c henry warren midsummer night madness by sean ofaolain 7s 6d jonathan cape sally go round the moon by h e bates 3s 6d white owl press mr sean ofaolain is a newcomer to the ranks of the short story writers of today this is his first book and it places him right away among the best of that handful of young writers who realising that the short story is the twentieth centurys most individual contribution to literature have schooled their genius to this highly disciplinary form the modern short storyas witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with fiery sharpness in fifty pages the author can give a degree of reality to the lives of his characters which many novelists never achieve in four hundred but the best story in the book is  the small lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed to stand alone   sally go round the moon  is a long short story by a young writer whose work has for some time been attracting the discriminating few mr batess special forte is stories in a delicately lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the exercise of just that lyric power which is his special contribution to the art of the modern short story,storie
the works of heinrich heine vol ix the book of songs translated by t brooksbank vol x new poems translated by margaret armour 5s per vol william heinemann the ultimate test of any verse translation from a foreign poet must be the possibility of giving pleasure to those ignorant of the original we cannot think that the two latest volumes of the translation of heine will satisfy the test mr heinemann has been unfortunate in the death of charles godfrey leland and of the author of the rendering of  the book of songs  before the sheets went through the press but the fact cannot be denied that the english of the last named volume is not musical and in almost every case is not poetry the  new poems by margaret armour mirs wv b macdougall is better and many of the points have been very cleverly reproduced but in this volume too there are weaknesses of rhythm and from it alone it would be difficult for an englishman to credit the high position heine has taken as a worldpoet feom a

new poems translated by margaret armour heinemann the translation of heines prose by the late charles godfrey leland has long been xecognized as a sound piece of work on the whole though it is marred by some careless renderings due to a casual study of the german it would be worth while we think to revise it and it is a matter for regret that leland did not live to translate the poems also after an interval of several years that task has been entrusted to others and we at last see this handsome edition of heines works in english drawing near to its completion for the resolution he has shown in carrying out his original plan under difficulties mr heinemann deserves all praise heine the poet heine is of course one pf the most hopeless of tasks for the translator he has that quality of the volkelied which trembles on the ludicrous and vulgar with effective naivete he is sentimental and satirical in a breath diabolically clever with a saving touch of the homeliness which is genuinely german and by no means english sie haben heut abend gesellschaft is this the same in english and is there any adequate english for it  we think not and even talented imitators of heine such as w e henley suffer when they try to transplant the flower of his genius henley writes i took a hansom on tonight which is frankly a failure and indeed the number of absolute successes scored in this perilously attractive field is by no means  large as for the translator in the stricter sense of the term he is in a still more desperate plight for he must cling to the elusive german while striving at the same time to fly freely on his own pinions no wonder then if his movements are frequently a trifle awkward not to say ridiculous of the two volumes now before us that for which miss armour is responsible is in every way superior to the other it is indeed noticeable that feminine talent has often shown itself to advantage in the forlorn attempt at rendering heines verse into english and may claim a large proportion of the few triumphs hitherto achieved certainly we cannot speak very favourably of mr brooksbanks work he does not possess the lyric gift so that his translations lack spontaneity and freshness his literary sense is hardly delicate enough to be trusted by itself and as he is not always scrupulous in following his original the result is at times painful to a reader who knows his heine and not particularly pleasurable to one who does not moreover he is often astonishingly careless we are told in a publishers note that he did not live to revise the volume but with all due allowance for that some of the renderings strike us as strangely inaccurate turning for instance to the fourth poem in the  north sea cycle we find the second line es gurt das meer represented by  wide yawns the sea and the sixth  wien storr iger griesgram der gut gelaunt wird by like a peevish old grumbler an old acquaintance a change which of course utterly spoils the sense presumably mr brooksbank must through some mental confusion have read  gaunt and gekannt in place of giirt and gelaunt but that is scarcely an excuse now and then indeed we come across passages in which the german has clearly not been understood as for example in the last line of the burleque sonnet  dann mussich diirsten oder ich musspumpen which is turned i must perish of thirst or to the pump for drink be going miss armours volume which contains the new poems and  atta troll is much more satisfactory she has something of the genuine lyric spirit writes easily manages her rhymes skilfully and altogether shows a decided gift for translation her versions are almost always good and occasionally excellent and perhaps we are not justified in asking more from a translator who foregoes the right of selecting isolated poems according to personal fancy sometimes she might with advantage keep a little more closely to the original and bear in mind that heine did not choose his epithets at random but no doubt it is easier to find fault with the translators of such a poet than to make allowances for the enormous difficulties with which they have to contend and it is only fair to acknowledge that miss armours work as a whole is much above the average we may permit ourselves the pleasure of quoting a short poem as a sample of it your lying promise of delight deceived not long my heart like a deceitful dream of night you came but to depart the morning broke tue mists dissolved before the shining sun  we were already at the end ere we had well begun,storie
fiction visionaries by james hunbker werner laurie 6s these visionaries are near the borderland of sanity and they are at large two have escaped from a lunatic asylum and get locked up again but they are not madder than the rest they all have dreams they cannot distinguish from realities they die of their own monstrous inventions they are morbidly sensitive to odours their affections travel in forbidden ways there is no manifestation of the abnormal seized by modern frenchmen that has not attracted this young american too no twisted byway in morals and philosophy his men and women do not follow fascinated and misled he is indeed so plainly under the spell of his masters that at first we suspected him of being their shadow and of having no substance of his own the second story for instance that about the deadly art of perfume convinced us that the author had read his huysmans and also that he knew how to make magic with a string of picturesque words the oie before that too had juggled marvellously with words and had instantly assured us that we should find in this volume the very latest affectations in art we are to worship weber today it seems and to renounce wagner and all his works we are too much behind the fashion to know it but we were not greatly surprised though the cry itself was new the voice sounded familiar what did surprise us was to find in the third story  the purse of aholibab pictures that stay and take shape in the mind like things actually seen the authors style is sometimes grotesque in its desire both to startle and to find true expression he has not followed those great novelists who write french a child may read and understand he calls the moon a spiritual grey wafer it faints in a red wind    truth beats at the bars of a mans bosom   the sun is  a sulphurcoloured cymbal  a man moves with  the jaunty grace of a young elephant but even these oddities are significant and to be placed high above the slipshod sequences of words that have done duty till they are as meaningless as the imprint on a wornout coin besides in nearly every story the reader is arrested by the idea and only a little troubled now and then by an overelaborate style lt most of us are sane the ideas cherished by these visionaries are insane  but the imagination of the author so illuminates them that we follow wondering and spellbound in  the spiral road  and in some of the other stories both fantasy and narrative may be compared with hawthorne in his most unearthly moods the younger man has read his nietzsche and has cast off his heritage of simple morals hawthornes puritanism finds no echo in these modern souls all sceptical wavering and unblessed but hawthornes splendour of vision and his power of sympathy with a tormented mind do live again in the best of mr hunekers stories we were first led to this comparison when we read the spiral road and were dazzled by the wild flight of karospina and mila across the sky in their chariot of fire the russian dreams of regenerating mankind by his new art and the people of the world gather together on the seashore to watch the first exhibition of it he paints pictures on the sky wonderful moving pictures as evanescent as a song blazing symphonies of colour that are to arouse the world the man who looks on sees suns and moons golden landscapes men ships the four cryptic creatures of ezekiels vision a cyclopean and dazzling staircase thronged by moving angelic snapes harping mute harps stretched from sea to sky melting into the milky way like the tail of a starry serpent in the end he sees the woman he loves ride beside the pyromaniac in a cloud of fire to destruction of all the moaning multitude huddled on the strand he who warned mila is doomed to be the sole survivor to quote the author himself emerson the mystic transposed to the key of france sometimes makes bizarre music this music we shall listen for again for though it is certainly bizarre it is neither dull nor empty,storie

little stories abou  women these  little stories of very distinguished workmanship are mainly concerned with the life of english society womennot seen on parade but in the moods of remniscence and sentiment that come when they are tired or suddenly released from tensionand wih popular italian luttle stories about women by george fleming 3s 6i grant richards life of which the writer has an unusually close knowledge the italian stories with their pithy use of the speech of peasant and gondolier give the keenest literary pleasure but the english ones will certainly make a more general appeal while in them george flemings gift of light and certain portraiture is perhaps seen at its beat in  by accident for instance we are presented to the heroine as she is passing out of life hardly a fact is told of the years that went before but we know her this irreproachable wife and mother and member of society bound nevertheless by the slightest of bonds to her responsibilitiesthe halfconscious irony in her relations to life always a puzzle to her solemn husband yet in whom sentiment could be and had been awakened in whom it assertn itself as the strongest reality at the last on a lower scale of difficulty not of skill are the two portraits in a woman with no nonsense about her of the illmated friends one accepting the worlds good things with impudent complacency the other on whom life levies heavy dues because she lacks the great gifts audacity and grace in  for better for worse and in  mees the latter a study of italian patriotism as seen through the ignorant but loving eyes of an english ladysmaidthere is the same lighthanded skill but i miss it in the more openly emotional  the next house  and  a contemporary of the italian stories  the prince of morocco craves first mention for its dating subject and its unexpectedness it is an imaginative guess at the history of portias swarthy suitor of that name george fleming accounts for him in northern italy in a poetical fantastical experiment which is only audacious not blasphemous of course for most excellent reasons it ought to be a failure but in one or two directions it confounds the rightminded critic for it revivifies a page of old venetian life and it is a delightful bit of imaginative writing in force and reality however it must give way before the exquisite tragicomedy of the beggar women in  for ten francs one of the two great successes of the book perhaps at venice cannot compete with that one in familiar human interest yet i venture to think the highwater mark of the book is reached in the narrative of the old gondolier once employed in his youth by an austrian officer to row two prisoners to their death at the back of san georgio in most hands it would have been a mere picturesque description here it is a little drama concentrating into its few pages the venetian struggle gathering up the profound mystery of the venetian night giving too by the way the gondolier philosophers excellent summary for and against the powers that were and the powers that be  men walked the streets of venice with the cold fear of the white prisons and the hot fear of the white army lying heavy upon their mouths so that no man spoke of it at allno not even to his brother and when there was talk that man vanished   now we are all italians they tell me   we are all alike now 1 and maso and you

condoned by the general human interest of their tubjects a m  little stories aboun women by georwo fleming grant richards it is from a dingy palette that these impressions are spread they are keyed don to the patience of the most morose pessimism but they are truth that side of it and life at its most lamentable in the career of human beings there arrives a moment when the soul comes to the surface and the careful watcher may discern in the meagre spectre the never realised notion after which its creator fashioned it george fleming is this careful watcher she knows how to qapture the moment she is cunning to unveil it her method reminds one more than a little of m marcel prevost i select a contemporary it is the reverie of a woman upon what had not passed six y ears before upon the day when by way of a final indulgence of an unlawful passion she had given her lover a fareweeu rendezvous that meeting never took place of  they had been prevented by the commonest the most obvious of accidents it had simply rained all day long she had so vehemently persuaded herself that the very completeness of the sacrificethe manner in which she sent him away for evercould propitiate fate cheat justice turn this last poor selfindulgence into a mere question of compensation for the pain they suffered and then it had rained all day we look into the womans mind while the fictitious details of that sterile day stream through it just as by a more familiar device for securing the perspective of which mr harland writes as so effective an element in the successful treatment of the short story we have been shown the intimate leaves of the carnst or of familiar correspondence she arrives at the station for stonehenge so runs the story which she tells herself for the hundredth time and finds him awaiting her in the lumbering hired carriage he was by her side  his love was there  and in an instant a feeling of absolute satisfaction the rest the contentment of a natural completion filled all her heart and being stilled it filled it rising rising like water in a lock that trick by the way of doubling a word either to give a sustained effect or for intensity is throughout the volume overindulged they send the carriage away and lunch  and then    she told him the whole story rapidly impetuously without stopping to pick words as if some secret barrier between their minds were for the first time broken  i was twentytwo nearly twentythree and there were so many of us at home i was so pleased not to wait to be the first of all to marry  i liked all the things he gave me roger nownowat the present momenti like having those things still  but this was not all that held her when she was most nearly softened recurred the knowledge that   sometime somewhere there would come a certain day a certain hour when he ceased sic to care for her as he cared now  and nothing could prevent itnothing it was not even his fault  as they neared the terminus he made a laqt appeal and as he knelt   she laid her other hand upon his bowed head what was there left to say  she loved this man with all the force of which she was capable but she had grown up in a society which discourages sentiment and holds many material satisfactions for those who are successful after its own fashion her husband fusses in upon the finish of the vision the impression is of a little nature fenced into the strait path of social sanction by no principle of religion or of ethics but by its essential defects of courage and confidence subject therefore to every temptation empty of all satisfactiona strong and clear impression caught at the moment when the woman knew herself of the eleven other storiesand none of them falls below a high standard a woman with no nonsense about her

  at the rising of the moon irish stories and studies by frank mathew mcclure these tales are the work of a promising young writer landlords those agin them priests patriots and constables impartially furnish matter for tales grave and gay indeed at times in the impartiality we discern something which for a moment freezes our sympathy but all the stories are marked by a certain grace and moderation of style mr matthew does not always write up to his best which is very good his highest point is reached in a connemara miracle where the natural and the supernatural almost touch a mans life blood was about to be shed and the candle in a peasants window was to be the signal but the moon shone in on the crucifix on the wall and the face looked at him from the cross so murnane wrenched the crucifix from the wall and would again have made to light the candle but there on the wall where the figure had hung was a dazzling white cross and the signal that the rider was passing never was given the cross left white by the crucifix on the blackened walls was a miracle to him and saved a body and a soul  the other country a ghost story pathetic enough but with a kind of tragic humour at the end of it is almost as good mr matthew has had the good luck to have his tales capitally illustrated by mr boyd and mr pegram,storie

fiction montes the matador and other stories by frank harris grant richards 6s the author of elder conklin employs in all his fiction the device of what we would call  simple narration a device used by balzac and turgenev but not we think by any other great european novelist of the nineteenth century not even strangely enough by de maupassant the user of this device may be deemed to adopt the following attitude toward his reader   see here i have some very curious and interesting facts to tell you and i will relate them straightforwardly without embroidery and with only such explanations and descriptions as are absolutely necessary i merely want you to get hold of the facts indeed you must listen to them because they have interested me tremendously and i am sure they will interest you whatever you do dont mistake me for a romancer a concocter of stories now just listen and i wont waste your time  there now wasnt that worth hearing  true  of course it is true that is why i wished you to hear it such an attitude and such a method employed with skill and discretion are enormously effective in the way of vraisemblance and vraisemblance is esteemed by novelists the highest quality of narrative art it isntno one ever imagined that paradise lost was truebut that is another and a larger question there are five stories in mr harriss volumetwo rather slight and unequal to the three larger onesand each leaves you with the impression that the events told did actually occur the best tale is the first one the lovestory of an old espada told like most of the others in the first person it is a sinister and powerful recital and the bullfighting lore comes out of the mouth of old montes in a very natural and convincing manner  profit and loss  is a tale of kansas citymr harriss cosmopolitanism amounts almost to an affectationand the theme is an arson committed by an employee at the instigation of his employer the reward being the latters daughter the analysis of the criminals feelings after the crime is one of the best things in the book  he realised that all efforts were in vain that nothing could check the fire that his work was done completely and then remorse came upon him at first with a vague sense of loss nuch as one feels in missing the familiar and accustomed later with the full understanding of waste and destruction as acutely keen regret    the last story  sonia is russian and very obviously it has been composed at the feet of ivan turgenev mr harris could not have gone to a better master but nevertheless sonia is only a clever imitation the episode of the assassination of alexander ii is here used with singular dramatic effect the book as a whole is capable but mr harriss careless way of writing english will prevent him from taking so high a place as he might otherwise have occupied  montes thc matador aud other stories short storiei by frank harris g richardsthere are two excellent stories in this book the first and though one called first love a confession  montes the matador is tiie story of a great matadors love and hate but it is chiefly remarkable for the wonderful descriptions of bullfighting which occur in it mr harris not only must havo seen and enjoyed the sport but he makes his readers see it enter into though spirit of it and admire the excitement the wonderful escapes and the combined daring and skill of good bulllighters whether cspada banderillo or ehulo as a dramatic description of the great spanish tport by a lover of it this could not lie bettered she sordid aspect and the cruelty are left out of sightbut that is right for the matador who tells the story would not see them  he sees only the glorious excitement and the art of it ho even reveals a sort of love for the bulls whom he kills which comes from his intimate knowlodge of their character and their differences the story too which he tellshot passionate and cruelseems to flt exactly with the atmosphere to which it belongs in its way this tale is perfect tliero is not a jarring touch in it it is simply a bit of spanish life  first love is good also though it does not seem so inevitable as the first story lt is the description of the calflove of a very young girl for a quite ordinary young man to whom she attaches all manner of heroic qualities she linds that she can attract him against his will but knowing that ho does not love her she goes away and delilerately kills her passion he meets her years afterwards when he is prosperously married hears the story from her and is sorry at what he missed the conscientious vulgarity and stupidity of the young man on the stock exchange are admirably indicated in his own jmrrative of though events mr harris by the way shows great skill in allowing the unimaginative young englishman honourable but terribly commonplace to reveal himself unconsciously in describing his love affairs it is just the same type of man this time a budding mp who plays the second rule in the last story  sonia his ijewildorment and almost unwilling attraction on meeting a young woman ol unconventional ideas are very well suggested by his falling in love with her chiefly because she is a mystery to him and his very evident though shamefaced relief when he leaves her to consort with his correct young friends in the diplomatic service nevertheless sonia herself is not quite convincing and still less is though hero of profit and loss this is an otherwise delightful study in irony but it is spoilt by our inability to believe that david tryon would ever really have committed the crime he is here represented to have perpetrated altogether it is a book which proves mr harris to be in the first rank ot shortstory tellers  notes on novels these notes on the weevs fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow montes the matador by frank harris three books stand to mr frank harriss name elder conklin und other stories which was received with considerable

the story of stories by r c gillie london  adam  charles black 6s this is purely and frankly a life of christ for children the authors aim has been not merely to present a series of incidents but to weave the gospel incidents into a connected narrative emphasising  the transitions in his life and the hingepoints in his ministry in such manner as children may understand we have little for the result but praise the language is simple and unaffected  there is but slight expansion of the evangelical narrative and sparing use of the pictorial elementwhich is a good and infrequent trait in such attempts now and then mr gillie does not escape a violence or incongruous picturesqueness of phrasing in his expansion but this is infrecruent the story is at once clear instructive and well within a childs comprehension a good book is made further attractive by admirably chosen illustrations from the great masters calculated to educate childrens eyes along wkh their minds,storie

its cheese and the woman who counted her egga before they were hatched but there is always plasure in seeing how old friends like these are dressed up and most of the stories will be altogether new to all but a very few readers the most pathetic story in the series is one telling how a certain count having been stricken with leprosy for defaming his wife was tended through all his degradation by three faitgful knights too loyal to allow their disapproval of his crime to interfere with their chivalrous devotion and how in the end they were rewarded for their labours here is a good story of a different sort three impostors came to a xing and told him they were clothweavers and could fabricate a cloth of so peculiar a nature that a legitimate son of his father could see the cloth but if he were illegitimate though believed to be legitimate he could not see it now the king was much pleased at this thinking that by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed fathers from those who were not and so be enabled to increase his treasures for among the moors only legitimate children inherit their fathers property and for this end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture of this cloth and these men in order to convince him that they had no intention of deceiving him agreed to be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured which satisfied the king  when they were supplied with a large quantity of gold silver silk and many other things they entered the palace and putting their looms in order gave it to be understood that they were working all day at the cloth  after some days one of them came to the king and told him the cloth was commenced that it was the most curious thing in the world describing the design and construction he then prayed the king to favour him with a visit but begged he would come alone the king was much pleased but wishing to have the opinion of some one first sent the lord chamberlain to see it in order to know if they were deceiving him when the lord chamberlain saw the workmen and heard all they had to say he dared not admit he could not see the cloth and when he returned to the king he stated that he had seen it the king sent yet another who gave the same report when they whom he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth he determined to go himself  on entering the palace and seeing the men at work who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of the invention as also the design and colour in which they all appeared to agree although in reality they were not working when the king saw how they appeared to work and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described and yet could not see it although those he had sent had seen it he began to feel very uneasy fearing he might not be the son of the king who was supposed to be his father and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he might lose his kingdom under this impression he commenced praising the fabric describing its peculiarities after the manner of the workmen  on the teturn to his palace he related to his people how good and marvellous was the cloth yet at the same time suspected something wrong at the end of two or three days the king requested his alguacil or officer of justice to go and see the cloth when the aglacil entered and saw the workmen who as before describod the figures and pattern of the cloth knowing that the king  had been to see it and yet could not see it himself he thought he certainly could not be the legitimate son of his father and therefore could not see it ile however feared if he was to declare that he could not see it he would lose his honourable position to avoid this mischance he dmmenced praising the cloth even more vehemently than the others  when the aiguacil returned to the king and told him that he had seen the cloth and that it was the most extraordinary production in the world the king was much disconcerted for he thought that if the al acil had seen the cloth which he was unable to see there cold 1o longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of the king as was generally supposed he therefore did not hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill of the workmen who were able to make it on another day he sent one of his councillors and it happened to him as to the king and the others of whom i have spoken and in this manner and for this reason they deceived the ing and many others for no one dared to say he could not see the cloth things went on thus until there came a great feast when all requested the king to be dressed in some of the cloth so the workmen being ordered brought some rolled up in very fine linen and inquired of the king how much of it he wished them to cut l off so the king gave orders how much and how to make it up  now when the clothes were made and the feast day had arrived the weavers brought them to the king informing his maesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he had directed the sing all this time not dating to say he coild not see it  when the king had professed to dres himself in this suit he mounted on horseback and rode into the city but fortunately for him it was sumner time the people aeeing his majesty come 1 in thismanner were much surprised but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers kept their surprise to themselves fearing the dishonour consequent upon such a declaration not so however i with a negro who happened to notice

patronio  a moorwho was much r respected 4nd who had a son the most promising youth in the world but not being rich enough to accomplish the great deeds which he felt in his heart equal to he was greatly troubled having x the will and not the power l now in the same town there lived another moor who held a r higher position and was very much richer than his father and 3 who had an only daughter the very reverse in character and appearance of the young man she being of so very violent a temper that no one could be found willing to marry such a virago b one day the young man came to his father and said you r know that your means will not allow you to put me in a position r to live honourably adding that as he desired to live an easy and i quiet life he thought it better to seek to enrich himself by an advantageous marriage or to leave that part of the country the father told him that he would be very happy if he could e succeed in such a union on this the son proposed if it were e agreeable to his father to seek the daughter of their neighbour in e marriage hearing this the father was much astonished and t asked how he could think of such a thing when he knew that no man however poor could be induced to marry her 8 nevertheless the son insisted and although the father 1 thought it a strange whim in the end he gave his consent the d good man then visited his neighbour telling him the wish of his a son i when the good man heard what his friend said he answered  by heaven my friend were i to do such a thing i should prove t myself a very false friend for you have a worthy son and it would i be base in me to consent to his injury or death and i know for cer tain that were he to live with my daughter he would soon lie or death at least would be preferable to life do not think i say t this from any objection to your alliance for i should only be too r grateful to any man who would take her out of my house the young mans father was much pleased at this as his son was so intent on the marriage all being ultimately arranged l they were in the end married and the bride taken home according i to the moorish fashion to the house of her husband and left to i supper the friends and relations returning to their respective homes waiting anxiously for the following day when they feared to find the bridegroom either dead or seriously injured  now being left alone the young couple sat down to supper i when the bridegroom looking behind him saw his mastiff and said to him  bring me water wherewith to wash my hands the dog naturally taking no notice of this command the young man t became irritated and ordered the animal more angrily to bring him water for his hands which the latter not heeding the young man arose in a great rage and drawing his sword commenced a savage attack on the dog who to avoid him ran away but l finding no retreat jumped on the table then to the fireplace his master still pursuing him who having caught him first cut off his head then his paws hewing him to pieces covering everything r with blood thus furious and bloodstained he returned to the l table and looking round saw a cat  bring me water for my hands said he to him the animal not noticing the command the master cried out  how false traitor did you not see how i treated i the mastiff for disobeying me if you do not do as i tell you this  instant you shall share his fate the poor little harmless cat i continuing motionless the master seized him by the paws and r dashed him to pieces against the wall his fury increasing he again placed himself at the table looking about on all sides as if i for something to attack next his wife seeing this and supposing i he had lost his senses held her peace at length he espied his horse the only one he had and called to him fiercely to bring him i water to wash his hands the animal not obeying he cried out l in a rage  how is this think you that because you are the only horse i have that you dare thus to disobey my orders know then that your fate shall be the same as the others and that anyone living who dares to disobey me shall not escape my yengence saying this he seized the horse cut off his head and hacked him to pieces and when the wife saw this and knowing he had no other horse felt that he was really in earnest she became dreadfully alarmed he again sat down to table raging and all bloody as he was swearing he would kill a thousand horses or even men or women if they dared to disobey him holding at the same time his bloody sword in his hand he looked around with glaring eyes until fixing them on his wife he ordered her to bring him water to wash his hands  the wife expecting no other fate than to be cut to pieces if she demurred immediately arose and brought him the water   ha thank god you have done so said he  otherwise i am so irritated by these senseless brutes that i should have done by you as by them he afterwards commanded her to help him to meat she complied but he told her in a fearful tone of voice to beware as he felt as if he was going mad  thus passed the night she not daring to speak but strictly obeying all his orders after letting her sleep for a short time he said to her get up i have been so annoyed that i cannot sleep take care that nothing disturbs me and in the meanwhile prepare me a good and substantial meal  while it was yet early the following morning the fathers mothers and other relatives came stealthily to the door of the young people and hearing no movement feared the bridegroom was either dead or wounded and seeing the bride approach the door alone were still more alarmed she seeing them went cautiously and tremblingly towards them and exclaimed i traitors what are you doing how dare you approach this gate  speak notbe silent or all of us you as well as i are dead  when they heard this they were much astonished and on learning what had taken place the night previous they esteemed the young man very much who had made so good a commencement in the management of his household and from that day forward his wife became tractable and complaist so that thqe led a very happy ufe a4w ivo jo f9oq go hsw bs aa sidto mmhu my

the listener and other stories fiction by algernon blackwood eveleigh nash 6s in  the empty house a collection of more or less creepy stories with which mr blackwood only lately made his first appearance in the bookshops there were signs of something distinctly out of the ordinary run of stories of this sort but for one of themthe wood of death these signs might not perhaps have meant very much but in the present volume mr blackwood has gone far towards fulfilling the promise of his earlier work and has given us something that deserves more than a passing notice in fact he has shown that he can embody the results of what is called  psychical research in an impressive and even beautiful story that many of the stories in either volume are crudely sensational does not really matter very much they will probably help to sell the book and for people who like shocks of terror they are distinctly to be recommended though mr blackwood is often too anxious to explain the psychic motives of his tales and so they lack the quiet horror of such hairraisers as stevensons  thrawn janet or lefanus through a glass darkly sometimes too they are needlessly brutal but when mr blackwood rises to his full height he is likely to be positively spinechilling that  the listener should have the first place in this volume is a pity except for the sake of the title which is certainly an attractive one but the story is not the theme is a good one but it is crudely worked out and with unnecessary horror  max hensig the next is much better and is a really powerful story well worked out though here to be sure there is far too much explanation of the theme but in the setting of the story especially in the opening scenes we begin to see the author and with his vivid account of new york we find ourselves settling down to read with that pleasure that makes these constant explanations seem a little tiresome true it is that these psychic motives are as yet but little known to the general public and at the present time may require to be explained but the story does not gain by them it is in the third  the willows that mr blackwood really shows what he is capable of and in his long description of a journey down the danube in a canoe we have a more than delightful piece of writing we knew all its sounds and voices he says its tumblings and groanings its unnecessary splashings against the bridges that selfconscious chatter when there were hills to look on the affected dignity ot its speech when it passed through the little town far too important to laugh and all those faint sweet whisperings when the sun caught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till the steam rose it was full of tricks too in its early life before the great world knew it there were places in the upper reaches among the swabian forests when yet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it where it elected to disappear through holes in the ground to appear again on the other side of the porous limestone hills and start a new river with another name leaving too so little water in its own bed that we had to climb out and wade and push the canoe through miles of shallows by the time the willow wastes are reached we are thoroughly in tune with the story and are left at the end of it with a sense of having enjoyed something really worth reading there is nothing facetious about  miss slumbubble and claustrophobia except the ladys name and unless it be mr blackwoods artful dodge for preparing a surprise it might better have been a simpler one it is a charming little story as well as an amusing and sympathetic character sketch another name that rather grates upon one is  jones for the story of his insanity a study in reincarnation though occasionally rather lurid is quite a good one and opens up whole worlds of speculation as to what may really be the causes of these unfortunate phenomena that we classify under the heading of  homicidal mania  may day eve  is perhaps next to the willows in point of literary merit for mr blackwoods imagination leads him into very pleasant paths and he is at his best when he follows the lead and is not intent on proving his theory too strictly,storie
stories from the classic literature of many nations edited by bertha palmer macmillan  co it is a little hard to say on what principle this book has been compiled if it be intended merely as a collection of interesting tales most of the egyptian chinese babylonian arabian and hindu versions are out of place seeing that the narrative consists chiefly of interjections and mystic names if again the compiler had a scientific purpose it is not perfectly obvious for anything more fragmentary and haphazard than the selectionit would be hard to imagine whatever way we take it a work is open to criticism which chooses only  the shield of ieneas  and  baucis and philemon to represent the roman tales and in the celtio section omits the story of deirdre and the sons of usnach but for many of the tales we are thankful the beautiful japanese myth of urashima is the closest parallel to the story of oisin and his journey to tirnanoge in irish folklore and we are pleased to meet again the excellent hindu fable of the old hare and the elephants the extraordinary legend of perdiccas from herodotus is not often found in such selections and is well worth its place northern literatures are well represented and there are two interesting and eccentric tales from the american indians the translations are by competent scholars being in the main extracts from fuller versions it is a book well enough done of its kind but it is a little difficult to know to what class of readers it will appeal  songs from the classics by charles f grindrod illustrated by austin ospare second series d nutt 5s mr grindrods muse has her moods there are times when one can see her at the writers elbow giving him the word there are other times when it is plain that he has had to dispense with her aid but the beauty of brevity she has not taught him perhaps the trouble is that for all his ingenuity in the handling of metres mr grindrod cannot get away from the ballad tradition and the result is that some of his  songs  are a rather incongruous mixture of philosophy and narrative but as often as not the failure is due to a single unfortunate word obviously chosen under the pressure of a difficult rhyme or of the limitations of the metre mixture of metaphor is responsible for the spoiling of some good stanzas and the general impression conveyed is that of an unfinished production which a little polishing would have turned into pleasing if undistinguished poetry but occasionally a hideously commonplace metaphor startles one just when everything seemed to be going well as when diana renews her suit to cephalus in such words as these but tis not well new sweets to waste because the old thou canst not taste let not the dish i offer thee grow cold while thou dost starve with sighing for the old ones thoughts fly to tepid suetpudding but there is very different stuff from this in  the riddle of cedipus the first poem in the book there is a strongly omaresque flavour about the philosophy which certainly is accentuated by the metre in a rather puzzling fashion if from lifes drama that stout strutter  i  were dropped could some strange actor play the part would the pale light we call our flame in any lantern burn the same hath each small rock its place upon the chart shines every star in its own patch of sky there are many good lines a few good couplets not many good stanzas and one good piecesilenus but the poems on the whole repay reading and contain some vivid ideas inequality is their main defect mr spares illustrations are somewhat unfortunate a few years ago they would have been called embellishments they are occasionally reminiscent of strang and one of them a vase in the shape of a satyrs head is distinctly good but the sphinx in the guise of a colossal tabbycat is not convincing and the headings are mangled memories of debased vase paintings the book would not have been the worse without them,storie

short stord3s feome thirty years ago mr vachel went out to california he lived there for seventeen years and in his new volume of stories which have a certain continuity he has attempted to reproduce atmosphere it may be said without delay that northeast has achieved his end but another and to our mind a greater achievement is that he has succeeded in producing sentiment without sentimentality it is a matter of common knowledge that sentiment pervades primitive communities and affects even their roughest and most rugged members it is therefore not surprising that it should enter largely into these stories though the prevailing element in 4 bunch grass is humour mr vachell has given us some quaint characters from aletheabelle  the little  school  marm who quelled a mutiny among her unruly pupils by exhibiting to their astonished gaze a  rattler and then killing it for their moral and physical benefitto uncle jap who held an illuminating conversation with an oil millionaire enforcing his remarks with the aid of a revolver one or two of the tales as the author himself freely admits are obviously due to a prentice hand but the general level of the work is excellent the semidetachment of mr wrens stories in  dew and mildew is apt to be a little bewildering he seems to have hesitated between a novel and a collection of short stories and finally to have fallen between the two giving the novel if anything a slight preference the same characters appear practically throughout the book which has as a background a series of tragedies connected with suddendeath lodge humour and shrewd characterization of natives are mr wrens strong points and he can describe a fight with no little vigour but we tyre of his rather laboured satire of the ignorant mp who goes out to india on a brief visit and short storieseven semidetached onesare not a suitable medium for long discussions on education the author has createdor rather we should imagine drawn from lifetwo delightfully amusing children altogether it is a wellwritten interesting book which would have been vastly improved if mr wren had frankly made it a novel and deleted the excrescences it is always pleasant to adventure with mr roberts into natures fastnesses and in the feet of the furtive he is singularly happy  moreover we can as we read congratulate ourselves on gaining instructive information in a lively manner with surprising versatility the author tums from the adventures of a salmon to those of a bear attacked by wolves from those of an indian leopard escaped from a circus into the great northwest to those of a cheeky little chipmunk about all of them he writes with sympathy knowledge and not a little humour the story of the man shipwrecked naked and weaponless on a desert island and in spite of these drawbacks proving himself king of beasts is told with admirable raciness and vigour but there are no weaklings in mr robertos collection and to select the best

psychologist among the saints this story and the last encourage the idea of a superhuman directing hand or of fate the belief that the popular magazine has secured the monopoly of the short story driving the artist to the more  legitimate  modes of expression is largely fallacious the superstitious dread of being classed as  raconteurs which assailed many meritorious writers has evaporated and miscellaneous short stories attract a wide democracy of talent mr barry pain has for many years reaped just fruits of commendation for his efforts his latest volume stories in grey werner laurie is a more ambitious venture for he discards the gay trappings of the farceur and attempts serious observation upon life he is not entirely successful in this new r61e because his irrepressible gaiety bursts its bonds indifferent to congruity his quiet facetiousness and irony cling round him where the utmost artistic repression is required the majority of the stories are of tragic intent and many of them are highly ingenious in construction they are told with a sure instinct for a storys sequence and rhythm the mechanism is well oiled and the touch upon the levers is light and flexible mr pain is an epicure in  situations and ho manoeuvres them with much adroitness and dexterity his humour has intact all its sly elvish flavour but somehow the cumulative effect fails he lacks the inevitability the wizardry of the true artist the common things of life he cannot touch into life he flounders in the more familiar watersand inconsequently relapses into his old capers with a naive indiscretion delightful in itself but fatal to the purpose of his story his shortcomings in tragedy are obvious in spite of some shrewd characterization  short stories a tirle easily gives a specious air of unity to a compound which logically demands from the critic as much attention as is u8sually devoted to several novels mr john gadsworthys collection entitled a amodley heinnemann is a cawe in point his twentyeight items include sketches close enough to mere reporting to justify the title  things seen and gems of imagination i   whichcould only proceed from a rare and subtle mind the finest thing in the book in our opinion is the japanese quince a pathofogical study of the mind of an ordinary man who suddenly and with a sense of weirdness feels that he has a double it is really only his ordinariness that is duplicated he and his neighbour are distinct entities but his consciousness of self has nerves which can be wounded by the coincidences by which mr galsworthy exposes his lack of originality with this story may be paired a clever tale called the pack in which the simious imitativeness shown in ragging and mobbing is cleverly illustrated two noteworthy stories concern wifekillin in these the reader temporarily occupies the point of view whence a crime seems inevitable mr galsworthy shows his versatility by including a fantasyinwhich adreamerfalls inlovewith the soulin human female formof a lime tree mr algernon blackwoods faculty for the weaving of occult tales is already widely acknowledged and it does not desert him in the lost valley and other stories eveleigh nash though he unfortunately shows a tendency to verbosity and feeble emphasis the last of the ten tales is however a masterpiece the  worldpoliceman  who rewards the liberator of birds by releasing him painlessly and profitably from his body is a gracious conceit but it is in the use made of a barbarous advertisement of singingbirds for sale that mr blackwoods power is chiefly felt another good story introduces a halfwitted worshipper of pan who plays delightfully on a leaf held to his lips on the low plane of the horrible mr blackwood attains a measure of success in the wendigo a tale of a flying monstrosity which inspires horror and obedience simultaneously in the terror of the twins a story of diabolic power lodged in idiocy and surviving death to commit a shocking crime mr blackwoods talent is misapplied taken altogether the sketches of which sea dog8 eveleigh nash is composed are no t worthy of mr morley roberts perhaps the subtitle a set of seacomedies hamiered him or again and more probably he was handicapped by an influence which exercises pernicious sway with only too many modern writers the need of subservience to the persistently and unnecessarily banal standards which the editors of popular magazines apply to fiction the author makes no attempt to be funny in the last sketch of the collection and this is the best of the seven in the first and longest there is a straining after what some admirer has called  w w jacobean effects and the result is disastrous  short stories i am linking these two volumes together for no better reasons than that they both contain short stories and that they chance to come to me in company there is this difference between them most of mr wvellss stories if not all o them have appeared in the magazines and mr nivens as he tells us in a preface which 1 wish lie had omitted have all been rejected by the magazine editors on the ground that they are  far over the heads of the public one editor happy man to

there are thirtythree of them and only one that is not wholly worthy of its place the best of them are so brilliantly imagined or so sensitively human and of such subtle artistic quality that i doubt if any living english writer except kipling can show anything to surpass them the one that is not good is a vision of judgment this handles a big idea with a merely perky cleverness that would make one suspect it belonged to m1r wellss early lays if he lid not himself say it belongs to his later  a smaller man than mr wells would have spoilt the whole thing by being too resolutely pompous and

droll stories from the abbeys of touraine translated into english complete and un  abridged london chatto  windus 1874 people who reproduce recondite or obsolete literary garbage occupy a position which it is easy for them to defend and which it is difficult to assail to find fault with their wares is to advertise them and to expose the reviewer to the easy charge of prudery it often happens too that there is here and there a jewel hidden in the dunghills of the past some pure song among the many base ones of th6ophile vian some fact of historical value in the gossip of mrs aphra behn it is a pity that the student should not have such books always beside him as if the poorest student had not easy access to them in public libraries still there is this shadow of au excuse for many reprints of books which are meant to appeal only to prurient curiosity and when they are pro duced with some care and costliness in type and paper the chances are that they will not fall into the hands of readers whom they are likely to injure none of the excuses we have mentioned can be urged by the translator and the pub lishers of balzacs contes drolatiques the translator says in his preface in france the work has long been regarded as a classicas a faithful picture of the last days of the mayen dge when kings and princesses brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants in england the difficulties of the language employed and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the french of the sixteenth century taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages the archaeological value it must alwats possess for the student and the dramatic interest of its stories the translator has thought that an english edition of balzacs chef dceuvre would be acceptable to many no doubt it would and no doubt a translation of the marquis de sades chefdceuvres or of any other  scrofulous french novel would be acceptable to many but the translator like everyone else must be per fectly aware that the historical information of the book is absolutely worthless that it has no archaeological value at all except in the same sense as esmoncd has archaeological value that is as an imitation of the style and manners of the past and the style and lan guage of the contes drolatiques are not nearly so successful in this direction as esmond is the old french is like no old french in par ticular indeed it resembles nothing so much as the bastard old english of lady novelists who put ys for is and spell the ye and begin all the substantives with a capital letter there is no philological instruction to be got from this kind of thing and even if there were it would be lost in a translation to be sure the translator does his best by using some fine old examples of wellknown errors in english grammar such as  the wise man would lay at full length in a ditch to translate balzacs conte8 drolatiques then is inexcusable on historical or antiquarian grounds even beroalde de verville has the value of being the exponent of the nastiness of a past age but there is no historical value in a modern imitation of beroalde de verville and even if the cn ies were useful to the student a student so advanced ought to be able to read them in the original french nor has the book the excuse of being published at a price beyond the humblest purse or in a form meant to please the lover of beautiful typography it is got up like the boys books that are current at christmas and an illiterate but wellmeaning grand mother might probably give it to a boy now even the author would have objected to this for when balzac in the preface to the first edition defended his work as a work of art he also said that it was intended pour lea lecteura choiie the present translation appeals to the public at large to a public which has none of the education that would enable it to appreciate the art without taking harm from the grossness the contes drolatique is a fair example of the baser work of the romantic school of 1830 it deals with mediaeval themes and the author thoroughly enters into the horror and the lust which inform the grotesque of the middle ages in the voice and with a cracked imitation of the ringing laugh of rabelais he tells tales more filthy than any in the collection of the cure of meudon and morehateful in theircruelty than most that disgrace the records of crime in the middle ages theserecords are dreadful enough but they are at least human in their earnestness men were cruel because they were terrified but it is scarcely human to take such themes for art a gross age laughed grossly but there is something apish in the imitative and affected ribaldry of a refined age a cruel age acted with cruelty but there is something of the tiger in the artist who in a humane age gloats over torture like all balzac did his contes drolatiques are works of patient art look at the story of la succube it is a masterpiece of the romantic school the blind gropings of pedants in the mysteries of nature and of law are reproduced with the skill of michelet a glamour of moorish colour a savour of exotic fragrance hangs about the vampire but in place of the indignation of michelet there is only a sound of mocking laughter and everywhere in the book in every page we are reminded that this is the work of that balzac after reading whom saintebeuve said he felt like one unclean the book is full of art but to translate it for english people is to perpetrate another of the many crimes that are done in the name of art in this sabbat of satyrs and obscene witches among these foul scandals of monasteries and shadows of nameless sins there appears here and there the face of a woman that is not wholly vile or of a knight that was not merely a lecher but there is none of the tender poetry the pure love that redeem the coarseness of boccaccio the romantic school has scarcely produced a more hideous work or one so likely to do mischief in an english form the volume is illustrated with dores famous woodeuts now very worn and ob scure mr hamerton and mr ruskin did full justice to these drawings while they were still confined to a book that was not likely to find its way into schoolrooms it may be observed that the publishers have chosen to mutilate mr ruskins observations in their catalogue he did not end when he had said  nothing more witty nor more inventively horrible has yet been produced but went on thus in the evil literature or by the art of man nor can i conceive it possible to go beyond either in their spe cialities of corruption the honesty which mutilates criticisms for the purpose of advertisement is on a par with the sincerity which asserts that valuable historical and archaeological information

great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it grandeurs mhilaire merimee  cumuli turgenev  a liar of the stipx hoffman  the cremona violin flaubert  un cour simple tolstoi  the death of ivan iiytch daudet   la derniere claw henry james the madonna of thc ftttuie hgweils  the star joseph conrad youth this list of works by eight dead and four living writers presents but a very fragmentary view of the development of the short story but it contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold bug hawthorno  the tireut stone faa de maupassant the necklace  the string kipling   the mon who would be king barrio   how ga tin bi ease put ft to mag lownie morrison  om the stairs most of the tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness is fascinating to the student of literary art we close this compendium of fatuities with regret,storie

fiction stories of red hanrahan by william butler yeats the dun emer press dundrum 12s 6d in mr yeats  secret rose there were several stories of hanrahan the passionate and unlucky hedge schoolmaster there were  the book of the great dhoul and hanrahan    the twisting of the rope    kathleen the daughter of hoolihan and hanrahan    the curse   the vision  and the death of hanrahan the stories were full of strangeness involved in simplicity and of all the characteristic excellences of mr yeats earlier work not without some of that rhetoric and descriptiveness which he has now triumphantly done with the pleasant volume before us contains all of these stories save  the book of the great dhoul which is replaced by an introductory story about hanrahan and a game of cards and a vision of  echtge daughter of the silver hand   and it is prefaced thus   a friend has helped me to remake these stories nearer to the mind of the country places where hanrahan and his like wandered and are remembered take for example one of the best of the tales containing the poem  the poet owen hanrahan under a bush of may calls down a curse on his own head because it withers grey    it used to be called  the curse of hanrahan the red  now it is  red hanrahans curse  one morning in spring it used to begin now it begins with one fine may morning even so plato changed the opening of his dialogue but not in public our own feeling about the changes that follow changes of earlier work is that they are unprincipled and founded upon a misconception of the nature of perfection so that one may say that one version is not better than the other but different in mood aim and result the later version in this case being admirably chaste but leading us to fear that the writers final view of perfection may be a blank in the old version the girl nora was lying with her face in long grass now she sits with her face in her hands under a thorn and now she reminds hanrahan of margaret gillane not  gillen  maeve  connellan not  maurya almost every sentence is changed often simplified but seldom without making us feel that the new form is the work of another man who should not have been allowed to touch the old the book is chiefly valuable because it gathers the stories of red hanrahan together and because it shows that perfection is of many kinds and that there is no reason why a man should not write the same story in a hundred ways all good if he has leisure,storie

herowith the chinese it is not bo military prowess does not attract the applause of the people in their eyes a man is a model hero who takes the highest degree at the examinations and quotes the classics with the greatest fluency he it is who clothed with virtue as a garment marries the heroine in the last chapterof such a hero the love is alwajs successful in the endamid the plaudits of high and low of these  social novels a typical example is sir john daviss translation of the 4 hao chiu chuen known as the fortunate union the hero of which mr  iron is inflexibly good and phenomenally clever from beginning to end one must however be an enthusiastic sinologue to read through works of this kind few of which have the merit of brevity and all of which moreover tend to produce in the mind of the ordinary reader an intense hatred of virtue with the shorter stories or novelettes of which so many collections exist in china the case is otherwise these are fortunately almost beneath the contempt of literary folk and are in consequence comparatively free from the bonds of chinese classicism they do reflect in some measure the varieties of chinese life and at least let us know what the chinese really enjoy for after all the worship of confucius is practised at a considerable distance and even among celestials the wisdom of mencius is provocative rather of yawns than of amusement there is more imagination in them than the chinese are usually credited with their critics forgetting the extent to which the natural genius of the people is fettered by tradition by literary conventionalism and by the difficulties of scripts and dialects where that genius has had fair playas in the selection of sites for temples and groves in architecture and decoration in art up at least to the destruction of the mings in choice of colour and design and in many other ways familiar to an observant resident among themno inconsiderable share of the aesthetic faculty both creative and appreciative is seen to be the heritage of the sons of han although for the reasons above indicated it scarcely reveals itself in those portions of their literature that much too exclusively form the subject of western studies nor are the chinese by any means altogether destitute of a sense of humour for tile most part their fun is broad farce often not of a very delicate character but that they are quite capable of the finer suggestion of the laughable under a grave exterior is sufficiently proved by the story quoted by prof douglas of the man whose more than noachian existence was put an end to by the curiosity of his seventysecond wife to each human being at his birth the great king of hades allots a page of the register of the underworld and when the page is filled up with the record of the mans career he is called upor rather downfor judgment on one occasion the king noticing that the volume wanted repair tore a leaf out of it wherewith to mend the binding the man whose leaf it was thus overlooked lived on and on till he attained the age of nine hundred and sixtytwo when his seventysecond wife died and on appearing before the judgement seat inquired as to the cause of her husbands longevity which had often perplexed her this led to the discovery of the error that had been made and of course to the summary ending of changs days the wellknown tale of i a fickle widow one of the best in the present volume is another instance of this quality of humour chwang the happy husband of a third wife the lady tien and a great student of the ancient philosophy from time to time retired to the hills to meditate upon the works of the sages of old on one of these occasions he came across a freshly made grave by the side of which sat a young widow busily fanning the new mound he begged to know the reason of this strange conduct and the widow informed him that she was under a promise not to many again until the earth above her late husbands grave should be dry hence the fanning a labour in which chwang gallantly offered to share the offer was accepted and chwang was rewarded by smiles and by a gift of the fan he had so deftly wielded on hit return home his contemplative mood excited the curiosity of the lady tien to whom he confessed the whole story her indignation was boundless   if fate were to decree you were to die it would not be a question of three years or of five years for never so long as life lasted would i dream of a second marriage how the ladys fidelity was tested and what were the dire results prof douglas has told far more amusingly than we can and to his pages we must refer the reader a more ambitious and in some respects more essentially chinese story is the one that follows entitled 4 a chinese girl graduate it turns upon the adventures of a young lady who dons male attire and as a consequence finds herself eventually in the perplexing position of being simultaneously engaged to another girl and to two men how she got into this coil and how she got out of it and all parties were eventually made happy is told with a good deal of humour and despite the literary dressing to which all these stories have been subjecteda necessity for those to whom through lack of familiarity with chinese customs and habits of thought much of the original would be without point or meaninga pretty quaint air of celestialism is thrown over the narrative and in reading it faint faroff memories come back born over long tracts of space and time of bamboo groves waving under sunny skies of singsong speech and wandering whiffs of the sandalwood and camphor of the far east of the remaining tales the story of  a matrimonial fraud and that of  a twicemarried couple are perhaps the best the verses that close the volume are less attractive not through any defect on the part of the translator but because the whole beauty of chinese poetry vanishes in though process of translation the  kinkukikwan from which some of the stories are taken is a repertory in forty volumes compiled under the ming dynasty the storytellers so commonly met with in chinese streets take their materials mostly from this work some of the tales have been translated into russian german french and english see  the casket of gems by dr s birch and they are all well worth translation as examples of the kind of literature the natural chinaman really loves though illustrations are largely imitative of chinese drawings and many of them are successful enough in others to the eyes of a purist the female faces are not sufficiently chinese in character on the whole prof douglas has produced a charming book which younger folk may read with pleasure and older people without any of that disappointment which the perusal of oriental versions often produces,storie
literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by the irony

the bet and other stories by anton tchekhov translated by s koteliansky f and j m murry   modern russian library maunsel  co 3 od net this volume of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may not recognise the reference to griboyedovs4 gorye ot uma on p 41 as 4 the sorrows of knowledge the title of the english translation of this famous play is 4 the misfortune of being clever  the kiss and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in english  another would be sleeping or sitting at home with guests taribari rastabari talking but he the daylong circles about the steppe  nineteen to the dozen would be roughly equivalent to the peculiar words  clhtchedrine  is an unpronounceable version of the name of the satirist shchedrin a few notes would have been helpful an english reader cannot be expected to know who is a  milkite or what  kawha  is and why it

believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,storie
stories from the bible the first impression is what good value for money is this stout and well printed volume and by such an author  the next feeling is one of uneasy apprehension how  stories from the bible  the book is obviously not an anthology of extracts has mr de la mare been bold enough to rewrite the prose which is inwoven with the memories of childish years for so many of us  one opens the volume at random at the story of the plagues of egypt and starts reading a paragraph so it continued for seven days and when the seven days were at an end moses came again into the presence of pharaoh is ones fear allayed by that  or this for now the river not only continued to flow bloodred but the fish in it perished or this  the river stank and not the river alone   partly the prejudiced inclination for the already familiar has made us ready to be irritated on any provocation but still there is something not quite right about such things as these it seems somehow neither the bible nor the walter de la mare whose prose we admire so wonderingly we turn to the pleasant  introduction and find quickly that no man can be more convinced of the dangers that beset his task than the author himself for he says  ords in their influence are subtle and delicate beyond all things known to man and the least change in them when the are in company or the least addition to that company cannot but entail a change of meaning a change that is in their complete effect on the mind and spirit of the reader then to illustrate this truth mr de la mlare quotes parallel passages in the book of ruth from different versions the  wycliffe  i382 the  wycliffe  revised by john purvey 1386 the miles coverdale version 1536 the geneva bible 1560 the douai bible 16o9 the authorised version 161 i it is a most instructive lesson and just the kind which would leave a treasure in the mind for ever and there comes the reflection how happy a mortal is that child who discovers the  story  of c come hither  for himself and then reads what mr nahums grownup disciple has done in these renderings of old testament stories made  to put that remembrance of what the bible meant to him as a child  as completely as i can into words for doubts and fears depart with a straightforward reading it is no compliment to mr de la mare to pretend against ones better judgement that there are no flaws at all in the prose anywhere no flaws that is of a kind avoidable by such a writer as mr de la mare there are a few uneasy and inept touches when perhaps the wish to enliven the manner was not accompanied by his generally exquisite sense of rhythm and style but as a whole these renderings show that literary style and the simple beauty which should be but is too rarely made the test of suitability for childrens reading are not incompatible but necessary one to the other that alone is a triumph it is to be expected that in recording his imaginative experience of the old stories mr de la mare should sometimes abandon the bald directness of the bible narrative e  stories from the bible by walter de la mare 7s 6d faber  faber and though the change involves often a real sacrifice it is not difficult to be reconciled to the new beauty of detail introduced such detail and such atmosphere must surely give to a young reader visions which the old narrative alone could not even the sophisticated reader will find himself constantly thanking the author for enriched understanding fresh perceptions this is especially true where the setting allows scope for the characteristic prose of mr de la mare to say that the reader of  the riddle and other stories  will not be disappointed with this book is perhaps the aptest praise possible but this is to speak of the mere writing which if it is less free from the  defects and shortcomings  referred to by the author in his introduction is nevertheless the fruit of a task far more difficult accomplished as perhaps no other living english writer could have accomplished it consider the field covered by this volume divided into nine main sections headed  the garden of eden   the flood joseph   moses  the wilderness  samson samuel   saul david think of the dreadful pitfalls awaiting anybody who would rewrite the bible stories under these headings  is it not then a triumph to have enriched future generations of readers with so little offence to the most unprepared and irritable  there are uninteresting irrelevances and ugly barbarities in the old testament a child may come to such a book as this losing hardly anything of worth except an occasional marvel of directness but gaining contact with the ancient word and also with the rare mind of a poet writing in his own language r l megroz,storie

the love of parson lord and other stories by mary e wilkins five short stories of new england life very characteristic of their author whose portrait is given as frontispiece  three old sisters and one beau  is a oharming little sketch ending thus  the old bride passed up the aisle with her old bridegroom and a smile of youth that triumphed over age and memory shone on her old face through her white veil and no one ever knew whether she wore her own or her sisters weddinggown or had wedded her own or her sisters old beau harpers 6s  the love of parson lord and other stories short stories ay mary ju wilkins harper  crothers parson lord had made a rash vow that his daughter should be dedicated to missionary work  but love for her led him to give her secretly as if from somebody else dolls furs and pretty clothes and at last to let her marry though without his express consent the story is well told and the parson is one of those new england studies in which miss wilkins is particularly successful  the tree of knowledge strains probability rather hard an extremely innocent and rather romantic girl seeing a man prowling about on a very cold night goes down and opens the front door but meanwhile the mana gentleman burglarhad climbed in at the parlour window she apologises to him for want of hospitality takes him to a fire offers wine and calls her sister they insist on giving him supper and a bed and he becomes a new man and ultimately marries the young lady the elder sister had brought up the younger one by writing her loveletters from an imaginary admirer who exhibited the highest principles the whole thing is droll and not without humour there are three other stories in the book one of them shows very prettily the sort of way in which new englanders look back with pride at their english origin and with greater pride at their american independence the collection shows a good deal of variety nd makes a very agreeable volume the queens ttvin and other stories by sarah orne jowett smith elder  co miss jewett like miss wilkins is of the new england school but she is a little less severe she seems to take less delight in describing the drear austerities of religious life miss wilkins often dwells upon the past miss jewett is content with the present miss jewetts stories therefore seem to have something more human about them though they are perhaps not so ingeniously constructed as miss wilkinss stories  the queens twin is a description of a visit to an old woman in maine who was born at the same time as her majesty who married a man named albert and who called her children by the same names as those of our own royal family she had once been in london and had seen the queen and with this recollection and these facts her old age was comforted this pretty fancy as miss jewett works it out makes a touching little study one or two of the other stories in the volume are a little difficult to read on account of the irishamerican dialect but there is a pleasant genial spirit about them all in the green flag and other stories smith  elder dr conan doyle has collected the specimens of his recent work which he thinks most worthy to survive the result is very readable not artistic as the short story is or ought to be at its best these stories shone in the magazines  they do not appear so distinguished when viewed by themselves undoubtedly however they appeal strongly to the average englishman and sportsman  novel notes the love of parson lord and other stories by mary e wilkins illustrated 6s harpers there is nothing new to be said of miss wilkins but it is always worth while spreading the news that she has sent out a new book that can stand honourably by the side of her old ones here save in the tale of catherine carr which strikes miss mary e wilkins a dew portrait of miss mary e wilkins from a miniature repro duced from the frontispiece of her new book by kind permission of messrs harper bros a more heroic or rather a more military note than usual the stories are made out of the material she has made us know so well and feel so much curiosity about she has not come to the end of her digging in new england hearts nor shown all the beauty hidden in the starved soil nor all the grim tragedy strange with all her daintiness no writer of today has more ugly things to tell out of her record of life in one light the title story is a pretty idyll of a girl and a doll and of the same girl with a devoted lover but the circumstances out of which the child so fearfully snatches her happiness are ghastly and a sensitive reader will shudder no less at this revelation of cruel clean austerity than at some tale of the horrors of the inquisition the chief treasure of the volume is we think  one good time in which the glorious dream of all the household drudges of the earth is pictured forth with much sympathy,storie
the bet and other stories by anton tchekhov translated by s koteliansky f and j m murry   modern russian library maunsel  co 3 od net this volume of short stories has the merit of not overlapping any of the other selections from chekhov already on the market it would seem from the quality of these tales that the cream of this author has already been collected 4 the bet and the other stories are hardly typical of the kindly side of chekhovs work nor do they exhibit his skill in construction in any marked degree the lengthy 4 tedious story  is perhaps the most characteristic of his pictures of  interiors the translation reflects the style of the original with complete success we notice very few points calling for adverse comment readers may not recognise the reference to griboyedovs4 gorye ot uma on p 41 as 4 the sorrows of knowledge the title of the english translation of this famous play is 4 the misfortune of being clever  the kiss and other stories a cheerful budget by anton tchekoff duckworth 2s 6d net with the best wishes in the world towards our russian allies and the most friendly feeling for all their enterprises we must express the desire that their literary artists could manage to strike a more cheerful note occasionally admitting that in the past the russian people have been oppressed that invasion and famine have left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its greatness lies but it is not well to sink the critical faculty and to proclaim every russian writer a master and every russian short story a masterpiece  i the steppe and other stones by anton tchekov translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline of an emotion or sketching a  character from the ranks of russian society the translation is not satisfactory the most frequent fault is the literal rendering of idiomatic expressions  it would be no useit s going seven versts for a spoonful of jelly it will not quite cost is a clumsy equivalent for what is best left as  it s not worth it the following is not merely unfortunate but meaningless in english  another would be sleeping or sitting at home with guests taribari rastabari talking but he the daylong circles about the steppe  nineteen to the dozen would be roughly equivalent to the peculiar words  clhtchedrine

  our manifold nature by sarah grand heinemann the title here is too big for the contents and the preface much too highpitched a great observer of human kind and its exponent through the medium of fiction would have fought shy of a name suggesting so much or if not like balzac would have justified his choice by the strenuous efforts of a lifetime there is something very far wrong when halfadozen second or thirdrate stories representing hardly halfadozen distinct types of human beings out of a world teeming with differences wears such a title unblushingly then why a novelist should ever write a preface is not very comprehensible but at least some care should be taken that it be pitched in the right key this one here is addressed to some not very intelligent critics who have been greatly concerned as to whether the writers methods be artistic she contends so far as we can understand her not altogether coherent words that art is what you like to make it we would respectfully suggest that her theories of art will be of more value when her achievements are a little more and appeal to her to recognise the true direction of her work instead of using the cant of the day and posing as an artist because she writes stories the artists of the world are few the story writers even the good ones many and much needed the great success of the heavenly twins was a fact full of significance which cannot be dismissed flippantly on the ground of the bad taste of the public but its success had nothing to do with artistic reasons how much of it was owing to popular curiosity on subjects which conventional society has hitherto turned away its face from is doubtful some of it was certainly due to the fact of madame grand s distinct capacities for stimulating and leading popular opinion she takes herself and her mission seriously not to say solemnly the first requisite of a teacher she has the courage of her opinions which are not too much in advance of the time to make her a social martyr or a voice crying in the wilderness why then instead of posing as an artist which certainly leads her into affectations does not this really talented writer keep singly in view the work for which she is fitted that of a social reformer but too much about a preface perhaps before coming to the stories  the yellow leaf and  eugenia are both mostly about young women some of whom have madame grands very excellent ideas about morality and who accordingly prosper and one of whom has the conventional idea of society on the subject and comes to a bad end her heroines are exceedingly selfconscious and their stories are a little dull there is not a ray of humour anywhere unless the conversation of the countrywoman of property with the authoress be accounted humorous  and when you write a book do you put in the stops yourself stops and everything oh no not the stops of course  all that must be done for you but if they are neither amusing nor vivid their common sense and their morality are excellent the other stories have no particular motive  boomellen a sketch of a semiidiot is pathetic so are  ah man the tale of a chinese vagabond and janey the history of a lame village girl they have the look of being almost literal reminiscences they are interesting if crude and there is much kindly human nature in them indeed were not the title and the preface there to remind us of unjustifiable pretensions it would be easy to give much more unstinted praise to these halfdozen stories,storie

number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds seven flights is a collection of fairy tales and supernatural narratives clustered about one parent fiction with which all are slowly connected the sedan chair in question is a magic structure endured with powers simila to those of the wonderful carpet 1 in the arabian tale or the wishing caps in northern legends that is to say the owner has only to seat himself in it and to desire to be in a certain place and he is there in a moment when he wishes to return the sedan having disappeared immediately on  setting down he is to exclaim sedan appear and there it stands ready to do its masters bidding it has been constructed by a moorish astrologer and is the property of the successive heads of the old english family of the nevilles by whom it is preserved in a strange dunsky mansion at westminster the first possessor is sir wilfred neville a harumscarum fellow of queen elizabeths reign who uses it for visiting various parts of the world where he meets with a variety of strange adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number by mr tenniela most charming contrast in their grace delicacy finish  and airy fancy to the ugly phantasmagoria in which so many of the artists of the present day indulge balderscourt follows the fashion common with christmas books and is a concretion of small stories embedded in one large mass a christmas party is assembled at an old eliabethan mansion on the welsh borders and as the younger ones want something to excite them in the long evenings the elders relate or read diverse tales some of these have relation to matters of fact others are purely imaginary a few fairy tales being among the number the book is well written and fall of amusing matter while some very fair illustrations add to the attractiveness of the whole miss bowmans  boy pilgrims  is a book of which the object is the conveying of information on geography and history though it takes the form of a story two boys set out under the guardianship of a friend to visit the chief countries and cities of the east and thus we are introduced to acounts of 4gy syria palestine and other bible lands plenty of adventure seasons the less exciting parts of the narrative and for boys who like this mode of getting at facts the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course we have nothing more to say mr rennes  featherland or how the birds lived at greelawn is a tale which will probably amuse children being all about birds and beasts who are made to talk in the manner of human beings the last book on our list fairy lend or recreation for the

comic newes christmas box it is difficult to say why the public taste should be supposed to evince a disposition about christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the garrulous old lodging housekeeper bear mar s of the hand which gave us mrs gamp and mr micawber we may particularise the scene between majorjackman and the taxgatherer i i i i i i i i ii which as a piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle brings back reminiscences of the fanoru ghostly mailcoach which carried though deadletters in pickwick the story of the poor relation is readable and suitable and that of the schoolboy though much too prolix is in its wild but somewhat picturesquo improbability by far the most seasonaake of the collection a bunch of keys the next work on our list aspires more we apprehend to the nature of a giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on the part of halfadozen young writers that the good ol0 custom of christmas annuals should not die out altogether the editor is mr thomas hood the framework is contributed by mr t w robertson and the stories are written by messrs t archer w s gilbert t hood iv j prowse and clement scott mr robertson has bestowed more pains than are usual upo01 his part of the task andl has given uis a very pleasant sketch of two young brothers who finding somne theatrical dresses elope with theni and wander alout the country as savage boy aild his keeper ultiniately they break down are taken in by a kindheinrted lighthousekeeper who gets theni to fish with a net the result of which is that they catch a  bunch of keys and the more intellectual lrother getting wet in the process ii put to bed and dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that gorgeouslycovered and cleverlyillustrated magazine london society has also issued an extra christmas number containing no less than fourteen stories and poems we cannot say much for the merit of the letterpress but many of the illustrations are pretty and wellengraved and we hare no doubt that the stories some of which are by wellknown authors will be found sufficiently amusing by those less surfeited with this kind of literature than we confess to being at present  beotons christmas anual  is a thick shillingworth of tales burlesques nonsense mintkids a rid dlas the ptlnoipia story called snumbet see is by no means auingo but the old fairtales i a chinese doiste clet and the

louendary stories as the reader for entertainmont could desire but he must not hurry  on without consulting the curious data which i abound on such subjects as he has undertaken to illustrate and he must not exercise ini volition too much in a publication the title i of which teaciies us to expect ancient mate rial and memorable tradition we are inj dneed to outer this caveat because we do not j think that  the priors of lawford a tale j which occupies above 200 pages of the second j volume whatever may be its merits in other respects conies within the scope and spirit of though plan as announced by the author the origin of the hays the union of the families of halliday and macdonald the anecdotes and feuds of the forbeses ami gordons the  three maids of loudon and  the johnstons of fairlyall the other pieces  are consistent with the design and we only regret that such a slice out of the  dominies legacy should have been found necessary to eke out the volumes the style adopted hy mr picken may be designated as  gaits scotch  that is doric enough hut also marked by the coinage of words and phrases the meaning of which is tolerably obvious but which in fact belong to no language under the sun where for ex ample could we hear of the  pruriencies of a father or the u sexualities of a lover except in writings of this class  many of the notes relate to remarkable events and the tales we have enumerated are j various and amusing the  johnstons of  fairly is the most descriptive of rustic manners and the most highly wrought in tragic incident mr picken succeeds best in the latter for in spite of his apology we are deeply affected by the finale of this pathetic drama though we cannot laugh at the homely scenes of vulgar merriment they have however though merit of being cleverly represented and with truth to old customs it is difficult to quote from a production of this kind  we shall however begin with a sample of the notes  forbes of pitnacaddel and his many ecccntricities are still celebrated by tradition ia strathdon the laird was religiously inclined and taking on to college education in his youth besides being proprietor of a good estate he became the minister of his own parish but being like king david a valiant man he determined that his clerical duties should not interfere with the  rights and reasons of a highland laird and he insisted on preaching imho full costume of the claa philibeg and all with a great baskethilted sword by his side when taken to task for this innovation mum the regular canonicals of john alvin  the time being long before the disarming act he defended his conduct by three reasons diiili were the following st that though a iwicher he was a gentleman and so entitled ta wear arms whenever and wherever he isiil jd that he carried a sword because it knew how to use it and hi that if any inn doubted these premises they might put jilin to these proof whenever they chose such reasoning as this was decisive in the highlands isptvially when backed by  college lair and a strong arm  and it appears to have been irre successful than his assertions in bis clerical calling for being an ultra calvinist even unto the borders of antiiiomiauism in inulidiing from the pulpit against the hereticd doctrine of  good workshe is said to lave exclaimed  ve will be doing fatt the dell can ye do  do  and bc dummied   our next extract is from that tale where an tails daughter marries below her station a larniers handsome son jamie johnston of 1itirlv and misery ensues from the illassorted treiove match in her happier period she is tims ohirved  it was harvesttime and the field were pv with reapers and rich with shocks of new nt corn we drew near to the house and watched about presently a young woman iueil from the

service she still carried the high i rot of an earls daughter there was no affecttni of finery about her her rich dark hair   parted oil her forehead and knotted high ihind with a velvet snood like the common iitiilens of her country a plain lawn keriiil covering her shoulders was crossed moihstly on her bosom instead of thc velvet and rails that had once blazed from it with costly i iltiitifiiice  and her person now setting ito a married womans fulness was chid in ililli gingham like a decent farmers wife  watched behind the hedge with beating hhiis lor the recollections of

strangely situated the reapers ti round her when she canie to the end  tin rigs  not a rabble of ragged irish as i latter days have come a vermin over our tish plains  but blithe and brawny lads l lasses of our ain kind with light hearts l industrious hands with whom it was no griilatiim to sit and eat upon a harvest lieltl liics the recollection  it was a perfect pic ne to see them all seated beside the shocks  corn and lady barbara like a modest 1vu distributing round to them their simple 1  most gratefully and respectfully rejtiycl from hands like hers she sat down mill her husband on some sheaves of corn  anl when he took oil his hat to ask a blessing on the repast his thick black hair clustering round his sunburnt temples and wiped with his sleeve the healthy perspiration from his brow and looked fondly and gratefully in his barbaras face as he took the bread and milk from her hands i thought i never saw a handsomer rustic pair they ate their meal with a pleasant countenance and did not discourage the joke and jeer of rustic fun that went round among the reapers and as the latter rose to return to their work i saw a tear steal down barbaras cheek as with some strange emotion she gazed upon her husband  while when the reapers had gone he placet his arm kindly round her waist as il to acknowledge in love and kindness that this was a moment of real happiness soon however does it vanish  the lady is seduced from her husband and child and for a season leads a life of dishonour and here is the contrast   james johnston went about the cauld rigs ofthe mailing a perfect object of brokendown manhood suffering and despondency th only consolation he appeared to take in life was in the nursing and tending of his little laugh ter but providence in its mystery seemed to have set its mark upon him for even this last tie to the world was threatened next to be torn out of his shattered heart the winter time had set in cauld and grim and a lonely blackness seemed to brood over the ntlhbourhood of leafless carloghie when one dark night towards the middle watches a solitary figure of a woman came stealing towards the farmhouse of reen braes she was dressed richly for a pedestrian yet there was in her appearance and manner au air of wild and rockless dilapidation she sought the window where she saw a light burning i need not say this was the once handsome and proud lady barbara of carloghie with hesitating steps and rising emotion she drew near to the little window there was no screen and she looked in as well as her blinded eyes would allow her she saw her child lying on the bed and james gazing in its flushed face sometimes murmuring out a sob of sorrow and then wetting with a feather the childs parched lips isle rose and walked about the room wringing his hands in silence suddenly he muttered something with his eyes turned upwards as if in ejaculation for the soul of his daughter and then his voice rising as his feelings became impassioned he broke out into a loud and heartcutting lamentation  oh  if your misguided mother but saw you now mary johnston he said  this sight might perhaps melt ber cruel heart but slit is far away with them that never loved her as i have done  and now thou art her last saddest remembrancer and cold deaths creeping up to thy young heartand 1 am a bereft and brokenhearted man he stopped suddenly choked by his sorrow and thought he heard a noise without it was barbara groping agitatedly for the latch of the door the sounds were low but became shaip and abrupt and the door moved as if the walking spirit of death sought hasty admission in another instant the figure of a female wanderer stood before him and the pale and haggard countenance of bis own barbara appeared by thc dim light ofthe small lamp more like a deadly ghost than a living being k it is indeed barbara herself she said after gazing ionland sadly in his altered countenance come to lay her head beneath your feet fames johnston if yell only let me acknowledge i ve been your ruin and kiss my bonnie bairn before she dies  the lord prepare me for this trial he said staggering back to a seat  babby is it you come to mo

lady babby as ye truly say and another night ye shall never abide under my roof the two parents sat and watched the dying child and at times between their sobs ol sorrow stole a nameless look at each others faces at length in the darkest hour that comes before the break of the morning the pretty bairn gasped its last and was relieved from the troubles of an uncertain world nothing was saidnothing could be spoken as the women that waited without came iu to compose the limbs of the child  its over now and my deeds done said lady barbara rising  it is not fit that i should sit longer in an honest mans house with a steady stop she walked tow ards the door and ere the light of morning lind opened out fairly upon the breaking sky her figure had vanished beyond the fields of the farm and no one inquired whither she went     the fairly kirkyard where mary johnston was buried is pleasantly situated a little above the rtiar water whore the bridge crosses off towards carloghie castle on the night after the funeral james johnston was a  restless mau  and when his frit nils looked in  his pale face and wandering eye they shook their heads and said that it would be well if nothing fearful should happen when the darkness came on however he found himself unable to stay in his house and made his way towards the kirkyard to try to get relief by indulging his sorrow oer his daughters grave it was dark as pitch by the time he entered the little stile and groping among the tomb stones he could not readily find the spot where his bairn lay isle had just found the green mould and the loose sods when seating himself down upon a broad stone lie saw something move between himself and the starless sky but quite near on the oilier side of the grave  who is there  he called out with some terror  is there any ono watching in this dreary kirkyard that can have griefs to bear equal to mine  k deeper deeper and sadder far janies johnston  said i faint womans voice  for the grief of guilt

uncle remus and his friends rv tnl chandler harris osgood mcllvaine co mr harris in this volume gives to the world another and we regret to see from the preface the final series of undo remuss stories about the animals this collection is quite as delightful as the last and it would be difficult to give it higher praise than that in his preface the author or editor is unduly modest about his stories chiefly it would seem because they are not literature and it appears that this is one of the reasons which must prevent uncle remuss reappearance possibly mr harriss resolution is unalterable but as far as the literature question goes whether uncle remuss tales are literature or not they are infinitely better worth reading and written with far truer art than a very great part of what is dignified with the name the only stories that are not quite so successful are those in which the animals do not appear and certainly the best are those in wnich brer rabbit  takes points as he usually does from the other animals here is a charming passage ex5baining why brer rabbit was so full of evices i dont think brother lion had much sense remarked the little boy after awhile  yit he had some responded uncle remus 4 he blecdz ter had some but he aint got much ez brer rabbit dem what got strenk aint got so mighty much sense you take niggersdez er lots stronger dan what white folks is i aint so strong mysef remarked the old man with a sly touch of vanity that was lost on though little boy 4 but de common run er niggers is lots stronger dan white folks  the volume is made up with a selection from uncle remuss songs and ballads which aro not so good as his stories and with tales illustrating his relations with his master and mistress or his shrewd sayings and doings,storie
riddn the devil and other stories short stories by louis becke fisher unwin  mr becke is a real artist his stories are almost commonplace as far as incident goes but he has the gift of touching off a character or a scene so that they appear as familiar to the reader as his own most intimate surroundings as usual in mr beckes books the stories are all about the pacific islands and nothing seems omitted to make the life on these islands vivid the trader and his temporary wife the buccaneering shipowner the savages and even the animal life are all described with a masters touch it is difficult in such a wealth of good stories to pick out one which will dwell in the memory longest  whether it be those about that casual ruffian denison or that of the little savage boy who saved the irish powdermonkey or the tragedy of the white wife and the brown  woman  but perhaps the most thrilling and impressive description is that of the homeric fight between the killers and their cousins the blubber whales we know not how far mrs walfords the little legacy and other stories pearson are fresh for one or two seem to awake remembrance but they are all happily enough devised and readable dealing with modern society and modern domesticity  and it should be an attraction to healthyminded people that all the little dramas end happily the author finds her materials by the wayside and her wit keeps the roadway  but it is much to extract romance from  whiteleys and to evoke the most honourable side of a girls nature by an incident at golf on the whole these genial trifles should be successful the dominion of dreams a collection of stories by fiona macleod constable  co is in some respects the most considerable work yet issued by the writer who has been for several years the protagonist of the scottish gael marking how completely she has steeped herself in the sagas and mabinogion and most perhaps in the ancient poems or fragments known as ossianic one might have said that here is the translator for whom the revived cult of the old northern world has waited but miss macleod is better than a translator translation is wholly inadequate to reproduce the flavour the accordance of sense and sound in the language which set an early example of assonance and rhyme and free prose paraphrase with themes borrowed amplified and occasionally modernised from ancient sgeidachdan and seandain gives a truer impression of the ore which really underlies the heaps of verbal material which repel the novice also the writers method enables her to bring down to the present time her pictures of life and thought in the remote corners where the gael survive not that it must be supposed that the average highlander or islesman occupied still with the struggle for existence though not as of old with perpetual strife against mortal foes has leisure to speculate on natural beauty but he still turns in long winter nights and times of rest to traditions of an earlier day and his thoughts are cast in the forms of a poetic and highly figurative tongue this remarkable book in spite of an occasional falsetto note and some careless gaelic mairi ban  for mairi bhan  sheumais  for seumas muirnean for mhuimein cbreathes throughout the celtic spirit in its moods of mournfulness of halfsuperstitious awe of impassioned and stately utterance it falls into three parts the first consisting of what may be called modern stories of incident one4 the herdsman being an expanded and modified version of the hebridean part of the story in green fire  the white heron  is similarly a sort of corollary of 4 pharais but most of the tales are printed for the first time one of the most characteristic is 4 by the yellow moonrock here we may note that a touch of humour of which there is not a trace in these pages any more than in macphersons ossian though oisin himself unbends sufficiently would have saved the gallant piper from so equivocal an end in the second group abstractions prevail of these pieces  in the shadow of the hills takes the palm for pathos and beauty the last part consists of adaptations from the old myths they are excellently handled though some of their savagery and simplicity is lost in the process the style of the author is everywhere distinguished what she requires to put herself in touch with a world which is practical as well as literary is some relief where there is a tendency to the  phosphorescence of emotion to quote her own words  a little expansion of such treasures of humour as gaeldom possesses  more definite localization as a rule  and generally an avoidance of monotony stately though it be the best writing we have yet seen from mr w s maugham is contained in a volume of short stories entitled orientations fisher unwin they are six in number and with two exceptions differ from each other widely in subject while the matter of one of them bears some resemblance to the writers novel4 liza of lambeth if another entitled de amicitia suggests a somewhat youthful hand it will be found none the less interesting while in one called 4daisy he boldly brings fortune and happiness to a young lady who runs away with a married man the writers handicraft is however more interesting and original than the subjects he has chosen for his stories in an imaginative narration he is seen at his best and it contains a good passage which we should quote but for its length this little collection of stories gives rise to the hope that the author will arrive at a larger measure of success than his two previous volumes of fiction have achieved the critic who reads the last page of the bearers of the burden by major w p drury lawrence  bullen will find that several of the stories of which it is composed have already appeared in a volume published last year by messrs simpkin marshal  co and entitled the tadpole of an archangel and that the rest of the collection is reprinted from various  service  periodicals the note in which this information is conveyed is dated from hms camperdown mediterranean march 1899 before arriving at this intimation we found that several of the stories were familiar to us the writer is an officer of the royal marines and has considerable talent for the telling of short stories all are written with much discretion and the collection is above the average of such things marcheurs et marcheiises by  richard omonroy published by calraann levy is mostly composed of what french admirers of the author would style clever  little infamies and the general nature of these stories of parisian civil life is as naughty as the authors former stories of regimental life we should not have thought it necessary to name the volume but that it includes one of the most touching pieces of sentiment we have met with and one written in admirable style very different expectations will be formed by readers who begin at the beginning of the volume and by readers who adopt the popular practice of beginning at the end for as the sentimental romance comes last a sentimental reader beginning there may be tempted to turn back to other stories not one of which is of a similar kind,storie

short stories dunky fitlow by a e coppard cape 7s 6d among contemporary writers of the short story there are few whose work has been so consistently exciting and disappointing as that of mr a e coppard he began to publish his originally coloured and rather elaborately joined stories when the short story in england was suffering very badly from magazinitis introducing us to a strange variety of peoplefishmongers farmers tailors sextons sailors publicans old ladies and so on to whom he gave the oddest names he could find or invent here and there he built a totally different kind of structure as fantastic and crooked as a house in a rackhlam drawing peopling it with appropriately crooked man and crooked wife he had two distinct methods on the one hand a strong deliberate style in which the humour and the images seemed a natural and inevitable part of the whole on the other a fantastic slapdash colloquial style in which the images seemed false and the humour as heavyhanded as a cheap pun at times the two styles became slightly intermixed but not often disastrously he was influenced by chekhov but the influence was subtly assimilated he was even more influenced by henry james and the influence was so painfully obvious that at times he might have been merely parodying james but generally his own inspiration was so strong and rich that one forgot both james and tchehov at the time of the publication of the field of mustard he was the greatest living englishnot irishexponent of the short story he has done as much as any man also towards nursing the short story from its long bout of magazinitis to its present state of health in dunky fitlow he has given us fifteen stories though the publishers wrapper says fourteen except for an odd story they might all be called the bastard children resulting from the marriage of his two styles and they have inherited all the vices and scarcely any the virtues of their parents one searches in vain in dunky fitlow for anything with the quality of the field of mustard or the presser or polly morgan three of his finer tales indeed it seems scarcely credible that the man who wrote them could also have wasted seventeen pages in telling us the foggy foggy due a story even more feeble and absurd than its title the one exception to these remarks is a story called doe a story told in mr coppards most unelaborate and compelling style where one exalts at the sight as sherwood anderson once said of a master drawing his line with unhesitating skill doe is a moving story most tender and right in its touch in every way worthy of mr coppard ironically it is the fifteenth story in the bookas though it were too fine to be counted with the banal fourteen nevertheless one is glad to see it there for it renews ones hopes in mr copards future mrrk i il e vam  short sto ries by c henry warren midsummer night madness by sean ofaolain 7s 6d jonathan cape sally go round the moon by h e bates 3s 6d white owl press mr sean ofaolain is a newcomer to the ranks of the short story writers of today this is his first book and it places him right away among the best of that handful of young writers who realising that the short story is the twentieth centurys most individual contribution to literature have schooled their genius to this highly disciplinary form the modern short storyas witness the work of liam oflaherty t f powys v s pritchett h e bates h a manhood and a e coppard to mention a few of the most outstanding examplesis closely akin to poetry indeed you have only to scratch any one of these authors to discover a poet in elizabethan times poetry might very well have been their natural medium of expression as it is born at a time when poetry is in danger of becoming so individualistic that only the very few can find the key to it they have evolved for themselves a proseform which whilst it retains a good deal of the sensitive lyric spontaneity of poetry is yet accessible to the average level of adventurous intelligence the aim of the modern short story writer is not necessarily narrative he is content to leave that to his more omnivorous and less discriminating cousin the novelist it is enough if he can so interpret a single dramatic incident that by the magic of his art it widens out to implications far beyond its immediate drama like a pebble dropped in a pond it sets in motion expanding rings of consciousness whose only limits are the limits of our own individual experience not that mr ofaolain lacks a sense of drama but it is not his immediate drama which counts for most in these seven astonishingly beautiful stories his setting throughout is the irish rebellionused rather as the excuse of his theme than as a theme in itself we see his various characters not so much as protagonists in a civil war as creatures whose intimate and personal dramas that war has set in hideous relief intensifying them and defining them with fiery sharpness in fifty pages the author can give a degree of reality to the lives of his characters which many novelists never achieve in four hundred but the best story in the book is  the small lady analysis can do nothing to convey the intensity with which mr ofaolain has recorded the last hours of an aristocratic englishwoman who turned informer and was shot one thing alone mars the excellence of this book and that is the preface publishers may still find good short stories an unsaleable commodity but it can scarcely be claimed that this particular author has been well served by his introducer to begin with there is an unnecessary goad at wv b yeats who surely needs neither mr edward garnetts praise or blame and this is followed by an equally tactless diatribe against the irish people in general that mr garnett appreciates his proteges stories there is no doubt but need he have been so condescending  and anvhow could not the author of the small lady  have been allowed to stand alone   sally go round the moon  is a long short story by a young writer whose work has for some time been attracting the discriminating few mr batess special forte is stories in a delicately lyrical vein he can portray exquisitely the dawnquiet emotions of adolescence and he is an adept at catching in the net of words those brief poignancies that scud like clouds across the landscape of maturity unfortunately he sometimes feels compelled to embark upon more ambitious themes instance the sordid slum life of his novel and of this present tale of a moneyless divinity student miserably married and saddled with a drunken motherinlaw at such times his work is less satisfactory he seems to be writing out of his depths an air of nielodrama is apt then to creep into the scenes and he has little opportunity for the exercise of just that lyric power which is his special contribution to the art of the modern short story,storie

orientations by w somerset maugham t fisher unwin 6s mr maugham begins to be interesting this book is much better than either the shrill and hysterical lim of lambeth or the rather mediocre making of a saint it consists of a group of short stories and from a preliminary quotation in the french tongue we gather that these stories are the result of the authors efforts to find his mot littiraire they do not however differ from each other as widely as mr maugham would seem to imply there are narratives of modern life mediaeval narratives and narratives of arabian fantasy but though the subjects vary so widely the treatment is practically identical throughout we like that treatment particularly of modern subjects we think it discloses mr maughams veritable moi littirairea moi trenchant sincere candid humorous witty and flippant the flippancy is happily less than it used to be one could entirely spare it we imagine that mr maugham has formed his technique upon that of de maupassant if so he has gone to a good master the best work in the book is strongly reminiscent of the author of zinutile beauu though it has a less severe and grave style and distinctly more humour  a bad example being the record of an absolutely common city clerk who through sitting on a coroners jury was converted to the most advanced form of altruism is an admirable piece of writing full of concise observation freshness of view and authentic humour the concern of the wife for her husbands sanity when the convert insists on reading the bible instead of the daily telegraph is very funny and very pathetic too and the subsequent examination of the patient by a specialist in lunacy is perhaps even better  i mean do you see things that other people dont see alas yes i see folly stalking abroad on a obby orse do you really anything else said the doctor making a note of the fact  i see wickedness and vice beating the laud with their wings sees things beating with their wings wrote down the doctor  i see misery and unappiness everywhere  indeed  said the doctor  has delusions do you think your wife puts things in your tea    yes ah joyfully uttered the doctor thats what i wanted to get atthinks people are trying to poison him what is it they put in my man    milk and sugar answered mr clinton  very dull mentally said the specialist there is nothing else equal to  a bad example the more fantastic tales lack point or such point as they have is unoriginal they also suffer severely from a flippancy which can only be called inane  de amicitia  has a certain vigour of presentation and some wit but it is a little late in the day to relate how a man and a woman tried to be platonic friends and then fell in love mr maugham to our thinking is a man who will survive many defects he has an abundance of vitality which is perhaps the scarcest thing in modern literature  orientations by w somerset maugham 6s unwin the east end of london is well known to mr maugham he knows it so well that he has discovered its gaiety to its real spirit he is less of a stranger than is mr morrison and liza of lambeth is a more reliable if superficially a less impressive and less artistic rendering of poor london life than 1 tales of mean streets but mr maugham is looking about for other fields to cultivate and wandering far he has lost himself he is trying experimentally in different styles and with different material  qui sont comme des orientations pour trouver son moi litt6raire this surely is too big a way of explaining or apologising for his new book of miscellaneous short stories an average book fairly readable but with no serious interest or promise about it the 1 orientations  are on the whole a mistake though not an obtrusive one while of liza and her kind he spoke with the knowledge of a specialist  orientations by w s maugham a volume of short stories by the author of liza of lambeth the title is explained by a passage from a french author who states that for discovering what a young writer is really made of there is nothing like examining his novels  which are like orientations for the ascertainment of a literary ego the  novels  are various in character but none touch the life depicted in the history of  liza unwin 6s,storie
shorter reviews i stories for moral instruction by f j gould rwatts and co 2s the instruction of the child in the elements of right and wrong apart from the inevitable school routine of merely useful information is one of those persistent problems which in these controversial days tend to become acute it is not enough of course to teach children the shape and size and origin of the world they live in its history and possibilities and peculiarities they must have some notion of how to conduct themselves conformably to societys demands in their progress through it this is that implicit education which would arrive naturally in nearly every case since any violent collision of behaviour or language with the accepted customs brings about reprisals which are so certain that they might almost be termed automatic intelligent and reasoning beings though their authors may be but further than this the beginner on lifes tortuous way must be supported morally must in some measure be fortified and informed as to the why and wherefore of these mysteries of right and wrong which soon are found to hedge him about so thickly so bafflingly and how to do this wisely and well yet without losing the interest and attention of the child is the difficulty which has puzzled many fine teachers and worried the brains of many excellent preachers our grandparents and greatgrandparents accomplished much by means of those quaint and innocuous moral storybooks which were the fare set plentifully before eager youth at that period of development stilted and dry enough these battered volumes seem to us today and we may safely conclude that the children of the present would turn from them in distaste this book compiled by mr f j gould which we have before us is therefore a little surprising it almost seems a case of a return to the oldfashioned methods we are aware that it is intended primarily for the use of teachers and that it is not to be read directly by the children but the thought occurs to us that a fairly large amount of modification will have to be performed by any tactful instructor before he can handle it to advantage if he keeps to the stories and gives them baldly so much the better for the moral tags and smug little lessons tacked on to each page are rather too obvious they have in some cases a distinct flavour of comicality children see through this sort of thing today they resent  morals  and  applications tell them stories by all means but be very sure that the child is quite sharp enough to draw the necessary meaning without having it ladled up to him afterwards as though the jam preceded the pill some of these tales are taken from wellknown books of fairystories we fancy the average child would prefer to read the stories for himself or herself and leave the sentences of precise application to the imagination of some wellmeaning person like the author of this book the healthy child detests anything approaching the  goodygoody  school it is out of date condemned by the precious little prigs it brought into being after a story or two under the heading of advice mr gould sees fib to expatiate as followswhen we want to do certain things and our friends happen to advise us to do as we wish all is well the comb combs smoothly but when our friends advise us to do something we do not wish to do we perhaps think the friends crabby and illnatured  the comb combs painfully but that is our owia fault we may be wishing for something that is not good of course peoples advice is not always good for us but if we know that they care fr us and love us we should listen to what they say like the mole they may know more about trees than we da ourselves like the monkey we may go wrong through not learning from other people all that they would willingly tell us like the boy we may not find our friends advice pleasant but we should remember that they desire our welfare surely this sort of writing is labour wasted there is plenty more of it though your sword be rusty and your steed mean your good hearts will achieve the victory for the cause of the people a statement which is open to doubt  better to turn grey while serving the world than turn grey while living for our own sake alone here is the concluding moral from a tale entitled the sensible woman you and i cannot help smiling either after all the woman id no harm the trick she played upon her husband was an innocent one he was such a simpleton that i suppose she often had to manage him as if he were a child when we look round the world we find a good many simple folk who think they are clever and fine fellows and all the time they have to be governed by people who are more sensible well and that is the use of common sense those of us who have more wit than our neighbours must do our best to keep the world in order and improve it you know how we are obliged to lock up insane people in asylums in like manner we have to govern certain wild tribes of africa and other regions that is why it is nice to be wise and sensible because it enables us to help the people who are not so well able to help themselves we should do it with good humour and as neighhours and not in a stuckup manner as if we felt ourselves to be a superior race the sententiousness of this is rather amusing it verges on pomposity and we fancy that most children would not gain much guidance from it also it is not very complimentary to the teacher that he should have his morals writ largely in front of him in such a hopelessly correct fashion the stories are all very well in themselves and it was a happy idea to include  the story of the nibelungs  this is rendered in a very pleasant and comprehensive manner and will doubtless be new to a great many children those who have charge of children will find the collection of so many tales and legends in a handy volume a great help in classwork without doubt and in this respect the book may be useful they will prefer however if they have succeeded in setting up that sympathy with their little friends which is the basis of all good work in education to omit the printed moral and leave the tale unadorned the children may be trusted to read the hidden meanings and as far as our own experience goes they most decidedly rebel at any attempt to rub it in,storie

fallacy of ghosts dreams and omens with stories of witchcraft life in death and i monomania by charles ollier au thor of  ferrers c london 1848 ollier ti i s is the antipodes of mrs crow es night side of nature airs crowe approaches her subject with a conviction that  there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and with so much faith in spiritual appearances as amounts to an admission that  there is something in it and an endeavour to treat the matter philosophically mr oilier sets himself to the task with a predetermination to negative the conclusion and with intent to disprove the assertions of those whom he terms the credulous it must be admitted that mr oilier is clever and smart and if ghosts are to be written down his pen will do it he not only collects all the established arguments against the supposed communications of the spiritual with the material world but he puts them in the most telling shape and where argument is wanting he is prompt with fun which is perhaps even more effective with the general public who prefer the pleasure of a laugh to the labour of thought now there can be no doubt that very few ghoststories will bear close examination and the fact is undeniable that a ghost never a ppears to the sceptical and healthy even the instances collected by mrs crowe are not satisfactory it is impossible for a cautious man to accept the 6xistence of ghosts as a fact upon any evideace yet adduced we do not venture a step beyond this we cannot dogmatically assert our unbelief because no plausible reason is or can be assigned why there should not be communing between the world of spirit and the world of flesh on the contrary the presumption would be not only that it is possible but probable that is to say such will be the conclusion of those who admit the extence of spirit and acknowledge a future state the only question is if it has been estbiehed as a fact and to that we must reply in the words of the scotch verdict not proven it is otherwise with dreams second eight presentiments and such like of these there is abundant evidmce as matters of fact and the difficulty lies in accounting for them by any other means than reference to agency which is usually called supernatural but which would be more properly termed abnormal because it is not a violation of any natural law but the operation of an existing law that is called into action only in certain conditions of mind and body the attempts to explain away these prophetic promptings of the soul by the easy assertion that they are accidental coincidences will not bear a moments reflection such coincidences cannot be accidental according to any known calculation of probabilities there is infinity to one against them and they occur too often and with too many persons and under circumstances too remarkable to be answered by reference to chance but what is chance  nothing more than the result of laws which we have not taken into our calculation in truth there is no such thing as chance every event is the necessary consequence of certain fixed laws and might be predicated with certainty if we had the capacity to grasp and trace them if then the coincidences in question are the result of fixed laws have we a right to assume that there is no meaning in them that the author of nature i affixed to them no purpose and that we are to treat them with disregard and contempt would it not be more philosophical to investigate them carefully with intent to ascertain if the soul have not even while in this its tenement of clay the power under certain conditions of the body to which it is linked of communicating with the spirit world and of obtaining by a kind of intuition knowledge which cannot be procured through the circumscribed media of the bodily senses and that this knowledge it is but how obtained we cannot tell which we term presentiment second sight dreams and which it perplexes us to account for because we have no memory of the circumstances under which it was obtained  it appears to us that this is the philosophical view of the question which has occupied so many pens pro and con and in this manner we should like to have seen it treated by mr ollier who has skill in writing to make philosophy popular we note as an instance of the sort of grtuitous assumption with which mr oilier has sought to explain away facts his account of the murder at dundry which was discovered by too persons having dreamed on the same night that the body was deposited in a certain well and mr oilier assumes that there can be little doubt that the general opinion among the deceaseds servants wvas that their master was murdered now this is a pure supposition and the fact was otherwise we were present at the trial and made very particular inquiry into the circumstances from the witnesses and the truth was that up to the time of finding the body in the well at the earnest entreaty of the men who had dreamed that it was concealed there not the slightest suspicion of murder had been entertained by any person in the family or out of it it was supposed that the farmer had either killed himself or died in a fit therefore it was that nobody thought it worth while to examine a dry well covered by a huge stone which it required two men to lift hence there was not in the minds of the dreamers anything that could have led their sleeping thoughts to the well besides if they had suspected murder why did not the well suggest itself to their waking thoughts when actually on the premises searching and it was before their eyes  it is at least an extraordinary fact that two persons should have chanced to have the same dream in itself a marvellous accident on the same night such combinations of accident would be more wonderful than the fact itself and more hard to believe than the explanation which we confess presents itself to our mind i as that which is the rationale of this and all  other revelations of the same kind namely that the state of mind and body which in mesmerism calls forth that faculty of perception beyond the range of the senses which we term clairvoyance exists also in certain other states of body and mind that one of the conditions under which this species of perception occurs is thati the attention should be intensely fixed upon the object that in the case under consideration there was the condition of attention fixed upon the object namely the missing farmer that in sleep the state of mind and body occurred wvhich permits of perception by other than the media of the bodily senses and then the object vas perceived by the sleepers and remembered by them as a dream it is a phenomenon every day witnessed in persons in a state of mesmerism and there is no reason why the faculty should not be developed in other states wve have little doubt indeed that when the subject comes to be investigated by a series of close observations it will be found that this faculty which is called clairvoyanee is possessed by nal of us but developed only in certain states of mind or body more frequently however than we at present ha ve any suspicion of we are not sure that many of the thoughts and much of the knowledge we possess is not obtained by means of this facultynay we are inclined to believe that all of that mysterious intelligence which we term instinct is to be traced to the same source but this is too large a subject to enter upon here for the present we close mr olliers book having derived from it much amusement and with a hope that lie will be induced to look more profoundly into the subject and employ his great abilities to its elucidation rather than to an endeavour to laugh it down the papers collected in this volume originally appeared in ainsworths m1agazine and that will account for their somewhat gossiping tone,storie

a collection of short stories the garnet bracelet by alexander kuprin duckworth 7s net in his introduction to this volume of short stories mr lion phelps professor of english literature at yale university has seized the opportunity to inform caution and put right american opinion upon the whole subject of russian literature his manner in so doing is unfamiliar to english readers it makes us feel that while we read we are like alice dwindling away in height by the end of the first page we are much too young even to attend a university  by the end of the second and especially when that tiny little joke is popped into our baby mouths we are of a size to spell out maxims at a learned knee  a novel is not great simply because it is written in the russian language nor because its author has a name difficult to pronounce or a slavishno pun intendedadoration of russian novels is not tself an indication of critical intelligence or a pessimist is not necessarily a profound thinker nor is unclean ness in itself a sign of virility but surely mr phelps exaggerates the extreme innocence of american literary opinion  he must surely be mistaken in not realising that it has long cut down these modest flowers of thought with its little hatchet nevertheless even kuprin is described in terms that remind us of those infantile dogmatics about the cat and the mat and  run fox run    he soars and he sinks  he is holy and he is coarse  he is sublime and he is flat between this introduction and the preface contributed by the translator mr pasvolsky who ls at naive pains to inform us when kuprin is at his best and why he is at his best the author makes a difficult bow but happily the first story which gives the title to the book is wonderfully successful and so the bow is a triumphant one  the garnet bracelet  is a story of hopeless love it tells how a poor official fell in love with the beautiful princess vera nicolaeyna for seven years he wrote to her and then on her birthday he sent her the bracelet at this her husband and brother interfered they sought the man out and he after giving them to understand that he fully realised the impossibility of the situation promised them to disappear next day the princess read of his suicide she received from him a letter written just before he had shot himself expressing his happiness in having loved her and begging her to ask someone to play for her in his memory the largo appassionata from sonata 2 op 2 of beethoven from this oldfashioned plot oldfashioned like the poor bracelet with its illpolished stones its green stdrie in the middle with the five deep red ones surrounding there come rays of deep quivering light and all that they reveal is linked together just for one moment becomes part of the tragic lifestory of the strangely simple man for whom  to love was enough  may nothing transient or vain trouble your beautiful soul he writes but the life of the princess is composed of what is transient and vain  the society in which she lives is transient and vain  real love could have no part in it but being woman her secret dream is of a love that shall fill her whole life  it has come near her and now it is gone for ever the other stories in the book do not approach the first  horse thieves  and  the jewess  are we imagine written under the influence of tchehov the first which is an account of a little boys association with beggars and thieves and contains a hideous picture of mob violence has many a touch which puts us in mind of the great writer but only to marvel before kuprins heaviness at the delicacy and surety of the other in  the jewess again it is easy to see in what soil the idea has been nourished but a sorry weed has grown coarse straggling with no flower at all for all the authors urging until at the last he has propped it up with an old stick of allegory which never for an instant deceives us a word must be said about  an evening guest in a letter giving a hst of the works he considers his most successful the author places it first this is very interesting as showing the extraordinary difference between the russian consciousness and ours to us  the evening guest  is quite impossible  it is very nearly absurd in its ingenuousness one evening somebody knocks at th writers door it sets him wondering who is there who might be there and how unknown is the future he compares life at great length to a game of cards and then imagines that some madman should hit upon the idea of a lottery of life on an appointed day there would stand an enormous urn filled with cards one of which we must draw and then what is life except this drawing of lots out of an urn of fate  and so on until he falls to wondering whether he will be able to make certain sounds to which that other person on the other side of the door will respond until finally when we are almost inclined to call it childish he cries  every time that i think of the vastness complexity darkness and elemental accidentality of this general intertwining of lives my own life appears to me like a tiny speck of dust tossed in the fury of a tempest what more is to be said  k m,storie

lhovel lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further

insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the call of the wild by jack london i heinemann tnis book is published in london by mr heinemann it was apparently printed and electrotyped in america and upon its first page is found the legend the m m co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with messrs macmillan its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that youve learned your place and i know mine be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high be a bad dog an i l whale th stuffinouta you understand v as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its author has so far given us,storie
shorter reviews i stories for moral instruction by f j gould rwatts and co 2s the instruction of the child in the elements of right and wrong apart from the inevitable school routine of merely useful information is one of those persistent problems which in these controversial days tend to become acute it is not enough of course to teach children the shape and size and origin of the world they live in its history and possibilities and peculiarities they must have some notion of how to conduct themselves conformably to societys demands in their progress through it this is that implicit education which would arrive naturally in nearly every case since any violent collision of behaviour or language with the accepted customs brings about reprisals which are so certain that they might almost be termed automatic intelligent and reasoning beings though their authors may be but further than this the beginner on lifes tortuous way must be supported morally must in some measure be fortified and informed as to the why and wherefore of these mysteries of right and wrong which soon are found to hedge him about so thickly so bafflingly and how to do this wisely and well yet without losing the interest and attention of the child is the difficulty which has puzzled many fine teachers and worried the brains of many excellent preachers our grandparents and greatgrandparents accomplished much by means of those quaint and innocuous moral storybooks which were the fare set plentifully before eager youth at that period of development stilted and dry enough these battered volumes seem to us today and we may safely conclude that the children of the present would turn from them in distaste this book compiled by mr f j gould which we have before us is therefore a little surprising it almost seems a case of a return to the oldfashioned methods we are aware that it is intended primarily for the use of teachers and that it is not to be read directly by the children but the thought occurs to us that a fairly large amount of modification will have to be performed by any tactful instructor before he can handle it to advantage if he keeps to the stories and gives them baldly so much the better for the moral tags and smug little lessons tacked on to each page are rather too obvious they have in some cases a distinct flavour of comicality children see through this sort of thing today they resent  morals  and  applications tell them stories by all means but be very sure that the child is quite sharp enough to draw the necessary meaning without having it ladled up to him afterwards as though the jam preceded the pill some of these tales are taken from wellknown books of fairystories we fancy the average child would prefer to read the stories for himself or herself and leave the sentences of precise application to the imagination of some wellmeaning person like the author of this book the healthy child detests anything approaching the  goodygoody  school it is out of date condemned by the precious little prigs it brought into being after a story or two under the heading of advice mr gould sees fib to expatiate as followswhen we want to do certain things and our friends happen to advise us to do as we wish all is well the comb combs smoothly but when our friends advise us to do something we do not wish to do we perhaps think the friends crabby and illnatured  the comb combs painfully but that is our owia fault we may be wishing for something that is not good of course peoples advice is not always good for us but if we know that they care fr us and love us we should listen to what they say like the mole they may know more about trees than we da ourselves like the monkey we may go wrong through not learning from other people all that they would willingly tell us like the boy we may not find our friends advice pleasant but we should remember that they desire our welfare surely this sort of writing is labour wasted there is plenty more of it though your sword be rusty and your steed mean your good hearts will achieve the victory for the cause of the people a statement which is open to doubt  better to turn grey while serving the world than turn grey while living for our own sake alone here is the concluding moral from a tale entitled the sensible woman you and i cannot help smiling either after all the woman id no harm the trick she played upon her husband was an innocent one he was such a simpleton that i suppose she often had to manage him as if he were a child when we look round the world we find a good many simple folk who think they are clever and fine fellows and all the time they have to be governed by people who are more sensible well and that is the use of common sense those of us who have more wit than our neighbours must do our best to keep the world in order and improve it you know how we are obliged to lock up insane people in asylums in like manner we have to govern certain wild tribes of africa and other regions that is why it is nice to be wise and sensible because it enables us to help the people who are not so well able to help themselves we should do it with good humour and as neighhours and not in a stuckup manner as if we felt ourselves to be a superior race the sententiousness of this is rather amusing it verges on pomposity and we fancy that most children would not gain much guidance from it also it is not very complimentary to the teacher that he should have his morals writ largely in front of him in such a hopelessly correct fashion the stories are all very well in themselves and it was a happy idea to include  the story of the nibelungs  this is rendered in a very pleasant and comprehensive manner and will doubtless be new to a great many children those who have charge of children will find the collection of so many tales and legends in a handy volume a great help in classwork without doubt and in this respect the book may be useful they will prefer however if they have succeeded in setting up that sympathy with their little friends which is the basis of all good work in education to omit the printed moral and leave the tale unadorned the children may be trusted to read the hidden meanings and as far as our own experience goes they most decidedly rebel at any attempt to rub it in,storie

the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby os max goschen an unmistakable originality is evident in every one of the fourteen stories and sketches which comprise the adventuress the author seems to have studied maupassant but followed him at a safe distance for if the method is similar the manner is his own mr willoughby loves his london and places in it the familiar types generally with a suggestion of the bizarre but without straining for effect and always with delicacy he has the true dramatic instinct even the longest speeches of his characters have a cumulatively stimulating effect  the adventuress and other stories by george willoughby goschen 2s net of these fourteen  stories three are distinctly striking by reason of a certain passionate crudity a realism that gives actual discomfort when we think that it may mean reality these three are  lily may  life wins and  a sea captain  quick cruel sensational sketches that evolve thoughts of pastel work  dark clouded backgrounds now lit up by the lurid gleams of the lowest life now suffused with a changing glow of luxury we would add the  watch night service did it not recall overforcibly mr wellss  love and mr lewisham  a london dawn  and the  psychology of fires  are more in the nature of tours de force  vivid in their way but unreal showing too much composition in the pastel this defect is still more marked in the descriptions of the isle of dogs and rosherville and it reaches a climax in the 4 correspondence mr willoughby are we right in the sex  delights in his technique which is nearly if not always equalled by his observation  but it is our impression that both will run to seed if devoted overmuch to sketches of this nature  in a larger theme these qualities would be kept within bounds and so be more effective he might try a wider and more complex field  the adventuress for example though its abrupt ending evidently so designed is not devoid of cleverness might be developed into a good novel,storie

the greater inclination by edith wharton lanelike many another clever analyst of human natureand especially when as apparently in this case a first literary effort is being madethe author of these sketches takes a somewhat dreary view of her fellowcreatures at the same time she has not succumbed to the temptation so common at this end of the century to writers of her class to dabble wholly in the mire while it would be difficult to find anything more hopeless and cynical than the 4 pelican 4a journey or even the 4 muses tragedy miss wharton is clearly a sufficiently keen observer to know in her heart however much she may try to impress the contrary upon her readers that humanity is not all dross the gold shines through with great distinctness in  a coward  and in 4 a cup of cold water  and indeed nowhere are her characters though dreary enough in their motives and actions quite 60 contemptible as they set out to be 4 belated souls is a particularly able bit of analysis as showing the different effects of a common action upon a mans and a womans point of view the reader is on the whole left to decide for himself whether  the greater inclination be towards honesty or the reverse and he will probably decide in favour of the former miss wharton has the further merit that though presumably an american herself and writing of american men and women she yet bas a command of good english and her nationality merely serves to add an alertness to her style which is usually lacking in this particular form of literature a florida enchantment white  co is a work of fiction from the pen of mr archibald clavering gunter who first made a name by his 4 mr barnes of new york an american monte cristo the english girl depicted in that work was too imaginative to be real and when she accepted with thanks some gum drops from mr barnes she did what any american girl would do with pleasure and what an english one would not understand gum drops  being an american phrase though not exclusively an american product in england they are called acidulated drops in this story however mr gunter deals with his own countrywomen and we shall assume that he does so with full knowledge of the subject we shall refrain from telling his story in detail as the knowledge of the incidents would lessen the attraction of the story as a whole lt is one of modern enchantment and it is alike realistic and improbable nevertheless there is much interest in it and the situations which might easily have been offensive are treated with tact and discretion we are in doubt however as to whether a hippopotamus was actually  tossing the water with his ugly snout where crocodiles abounded p 60 the language may sometimes puzzle those who are unread in american literature that a lady should  fire  her garters on the mantelpiece may not be understood by them to mean that she threw them there  to fix my bath is good american for getting a bath ready yet to write  jupe  for petticoat or underskirt is not when a person  jumps  another into a carriage it may not be understood that the meaning is to push the person in a rage of kisses may be more agreeable in fact than on paper the mans state of mind must be extremely bad when it is  rather doleful and disgruntled there are many references to  adorable ankles  but this may be local colouring the volume deserves to be read and it contains a phrase in which there is no admixture of fiction major horton promises to follow his daughter and her husband to europe  for be bas made a sale of most of his phosphate lands to one of those alldevouring english financial syndicates which seml a great deal of money io america and receive comparatively little back again there are seven tales in the collection entitled mrs knollys and other stories by f j stimson downey  co and they show skill without charm and ingenuity without success the best is also the longest and is a study of spanish life and character though in this the dialogue is not handled with good results the writer is cosmopolitan in the range of subject and very nearly at home with english phraseology it is only by accident that the autumn is described as the fall and that sufficient reason is found for describing the volume as american  while the first story which gives its name to the collection is free from the least hint of transatlantic penmanship if we except the use of the imaginary word substant as an adjective on the first page the narrative called  our consul at carlsruhe is the contribution which goes furthest towards justifying the ascription of american authorship all are clearly the work of the same hand but none in this volume suggests that the writer is seen at his best operatives and their strikes and struggles form the chief subject of octave thanets stories collected under the name of the heart of toil downey  co these stories are clearly the work of a practised hand and one acquainted with the best methods employed by the american writers of the short story the dialogue is clever and never used unnecessarily and the settings assigned to the dialogues are clear and simple all the tales are american and relate to nearly contemporary life in the states of illinois or iowa it is possible that english readers will find some difficulty with the dialect and phraseology which the writer seeks to express  but those who enjoy wellwritten stories will easily overcome the difficulty in question the pseudonym octave thanet is said to be that of miss alice french formerly of andover massachusetts and more recently of davenport iowa her writing is good and deserves to be better known in this country than it is the volume is most generously illustrated from drawings by a b frost some of which are successful  the greater inclination by edith wharton john lane 6s this book of short stories comes out of america and it is good it is very good mrs wharton is one of the few to grasp that obvious but muchneglected fact that the first business of a writer is to be able to write mrs wharton writes with the finished ease of the skilled craftsman and with the feeling and distinction of an artist her imaginative talent is therefore absolutely at her disposal a force which she can control perfectly and exploit to its fullest such a phenomenon is rare especially among women writers she is clearly of the school of mr henry james her subjects are chosen similarly to hisdramas of sentiment of the soul excursions into the obscure recesses of psychology but there are exceptions and it must be said that though she is subtle she is much less subtle than mr james and  may we utter it   possibly more articulate she at any rate has divined that the expressiveness of language has limits the story which pleased us best is the pelican being the history of a ladylecturer a widow who began to earn a living for the baby and couldnt give up posing pathetically as a stressful sacrificial mother even when the baby was a rich financier with a wife and family they began by being drawingroom lectures the first time i saw her she was standing by the piano against a flippant background of dresden china and photographs telling a roomful of women preoccupied with their spring bonnets all she thought she knew about greek art the ladies assembled to hear her had given me to understand that she was  doing it for the baby and this fact together with the shortness of her upper lip and the bewildering cooperation of her dimple disposed me to listen leniently to her dissertation happily at that time greek art wa still if i may use the phrase easily handled it wai as simple as walking down a museumgallery lined with pleasant familiar venuses and apollos all the later complicationsthe archaic and archaists conundrums the influences of assyria and asia minor the conflicting attributions and the wrangles of the erudite  still slumbered in the bosom of the future  pcientific critic greek art in those days began with phidias and ended with the apollo belvedere  and a child could travel from one to the other without danger of losing his way throughout this tale the phrasing is of the finest the analysis unerring the satire kindly keen and the form without flaw what mrs wharton lacks and we feel the shortcoming to be grave is a sense of the dramatic her themes are dramatic enough but the drama seems to be decentralised frittered away instead of being gathered up as surely the short story demands into a single resounding stroke this is so with  the pelican where the scene in which the  baby makes his mother confess her duplicities distinctly does not show that effectiveness whioh is latent within it a journey again suffers in the same way the plight of the woman travelling with the husband whose death she must at all costs keep secret from the other occupants of the pullman is tremendous but there is no clou no adequate culmination on the other hand  souls belated  has a climax which is at once legitimate and striking the greater inclination may impress itself on neither the english nor the american public but it is none the less distinguished and delightful and if mrs wharton continues to write up to the level of it she cannot fail ultimately to make her mark,storie
general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public

  witclt stories collected by eliza lynn linton i chapman c halla more ghastly christinas book than this could not be imaginednor yet one more admirably calculated to keep readers awake at the hour when churchyards yawn a strange task to muster this terrible squadron of cruel and revolting dreams for the author of  realities the result is tiresome because of its monotony betwixt cowardice on the one side and craziness on the other there is only a plot of ground narrow as a monastery garden for any foot to tread threadbare the tales are all one like to the other the yearning ignorant creature greedy to extort from life that which life can afford to no one conceiving that by bribery and corruption and a mad bartering of his future hopes he might obtain a short reign of enjoyment or of vengeanceand finding in the moment of imaginary satisfaction the coveted fruit a mere growth of dead sea apples is in all of them prominent and of course by the dupe stands in the shadow the knave what makes such a book all the more sickening is the conviction that all our boasted advance in intelligence has up to the time present carried us only a short distance beyond the verge of that old world in which fanatical credulity was rebuked by fanatical cruelty the punishment of death it is true has ceased to be frequent the witchfinder with his investigating needles and judicial thumbscrews has gone the way of the ketches but the intense morbid curiosity the resolution to pry into all those mysterious relations of sense with spirit which ever and anon elude precise inquisition and may continue to do so until imperfect humanity shall be perfected are neither dead nor asleep,storie

macmnililn and co 6s a nnoails wooing the story of an alpine courtship by e m sneydkynnersley macinillan and co 6s mly lady of intrigue by humfrey jordan w blackwood and sons 6s the book by vernon lee otherwise miss viola paget is far too well known to require to be dealt with at length the present volume of vanitas polite stories which the authoress describes as sketches of frivolous women is a second edition in which has been included a new story entitled a frivolous conversion the heroine madame nitzenko middleaged commonsensible charming sarcastic kindly and russian is one of a party stopping at the engadiner hof her vishvis is count kollonitz a young man of the world who has done everything and seen everything and who has worked out for himself a kind of philosophy of life which can be turned and twisted to suit his present mood from the depths of an armchair madame nitzenko riddles his philosophy with her common sense and pricks his overweening vanity with her sharp tongue little by little however the young count loses his first dislike of her seeks her out and discusses life and its component parts the charm and value of the story lie in the psychology and characterisation the atmosphere is bright and gay and the various philosophies under discussion are treated with the light and skilful pen which miss paget knows so well how to wield the second heroine created by miss rhoda broughton is of quite a different mould though by some strange coincidence the action of the story takes place in a similar milieu the devil and the deep sea is the name of the book and it must be read from cover to cover all by herself lonely and shrinking from attention this young girl sits among the flexes her face stamped with the lines of suffering she thinks of the past with horror and fright and is only recalled to the possibilities of the present and future by the sight of a man in even worse plight than herself battered and broken lying helplessly in an invalid chair in the golden sunlight her sorrow is partially obliterated by the sight of his and pity for his loneliness makes her do little things for him in spite of his rudeness and obvious detestation of being noticed at all she finds out that he too has a past which it is his one object in life besides that of getting well to keep secret this mutual tie draws her sympathies still more and she protects him from the importunities of the other visitors in the hotel step by step she overcomes his timidity and reserve in a charmingly unassuming manner and compels him to look upon her as a friend until at last they both discover to their fright that love has ousted friendship from their hearts he is forced by outside circumstances to confess his secret past and she forces herself by the strength of her love to open her skeletoncupboard to his view what is inside it would be unfair to disclose but it is well worth reading the book to find out the dramatic surprise reserved for the last few chapters is a surprisea thing which is rare miss broughtons characters are all alive and human though we think it would make for more enjoyable and fluent reading if she would boldly write  dont  shant etc instead of the oldfashioned forms  do not you shall not you the little sketch of the family who also share the hotel with the heroine is most refreshing and amusing the sudden drama and tragedy is so unexpected that it is not until one has read the last line of the last page that one can appreciate the full meaning of the title mr e m sneydkynnersleys heroine makes her debut as a mountain climber in the alps the book labours under the title of  a snails wooing seeing that the heroine met the snail in august for the very first time and that the aforesaid molluscous animal proposed to her in the september following we do not think that there is justice or even propriety in the title we suppose that in the mountains they have change tout cela be that as it may the heroine whose name though cordelia  might have been goneril or yerenhappuck is a delicious young girl bubbling over with enthusiasm and delight at seeing and doing new things the possessor of an angelic singing voice and guaranteed to cause a disturbance in the heart of the most ferocious bachelor she carries all before herguides experienced climbers edelweiss and mountains she writes the most breezy and amusing letters to a girl friend at home and at last in spite of the attentions of a priggish oxford don weds the snail who is a cheery matteroffact sportsman who thoroughly deserves her mr sneydkynnersley has written an admirable book the most fanatical climbers have charming and realistic descriptions of their beloved mountains and the toils and dangers to be endured bef ore bagging them to quote the authors phrase those who have no experience of the alps will assuredly find themselves longing to follow in the tracks of the snail and the heroine and capture for themselves the wonders and beauties peculiar to the vast snowclad peaks in switzerland the author is possessed of a keen sense of humour which he has not sought to repress and the pages of this delightful book team with the spirit of fun till laughter voiceless through excess waves mute appeal and sore above the midriffs deep distress for breath to laugh once more we do not desire to convey that our condition at every page was such as is described in kiplings  necessitarian  the book would be extremely painful if such were the casebut the author is so sudden and unexpected at times that we were compelled to give way the fourth heroine is madame la duchesse de chevreuse intriguerinchief to anne of austria wife of louis xiii of france a woman whose heart was bigger than her head who compelled the admiration and service of all who had the good fortune to come in contact with her a certain period of the life of an english gentlemanan enormous giant of a man who cares for nothing save physical adventure and who sleeps with his sword by his pillowwhich is bound up with her interests is the groundwork for an excellent quasihistorical novel of the stanleyweyman type the presence of the great cardinal looming in the background and incidentally drawn on the cover with the vacillations of louis and his brother throw up into strong relief the more or less pathetic figures of anne and the duchesse surrounded by their friends fighting against overwhelming odds scheming plotting and intriguing by day and night under the shadow of the bastillethe huge englishman quick of brain strong of arm and clever of sword finds the intrigues amusing and only requires to be attracted by the beautiful marie de rohan now duchesse de chevreuse to throw his lot in heart and soul with the losing side the story of his adventures and the share he has in the fight against richelieu make up mr humfrey jordans novel entitled  my lady of intrigue it is admirably constructed and the interest is sustained throughout we like the englishman for his blunt common sense and with him feel sympathy for the defeated woman the sketches of richelieu gaston the kings brother anne of austria and many other wellknown historical personages of less note are skilfully and interestingly drawn and the exciting and adventurous elements in the book are told with none of the flamboyant  word painting  and excess in which so many of the historical novelists indulge we do not know mr humfreyjordans name as the author of other novels and if this is his first attempt he is to be congratulated upon an excellent result,storie
the jeir and other stories by ivan tur genev translated from the russian by constance garnett heinemannin the fifteenth volume of her excellent translation of tourguenief mrs garnett presents five pieces which belong to very different periods of the authors literary career the jew is an early sketch and seems to us to show a certain crudity on the other hand the next piece an unhappy girlwas written when the great novelist was fifty and is an extraordinarily powerful tale it shows his genius in full vigour it has been already translated into english by a r thompson trubner  co 1888 the selfish old man ivan matveitch is one of the types familiar to us in tourguenief who loves to draw the heartless grandees of the period of catherine  the duellist again is an early work of 1846 and like some of though first sketches of tourguenief in many places is imitative thus the passion of kister for the rather unsentimental masha reminds us of lenski and olga in the  eugene onieguin  of pushkin in the sameway we see him as previously mentioned in our columns imitating gogol the three portraits is an astonishingly powerful story although it belongs to the early period of theauthors creative power never were the features of the russian society of old timesportrayed with such realistic force the last sketch  enough  a fragment from the notebook of a dead artist is a sort of confession of faith of tourguenief and shows profound pessimism the critic can only say as he reads it the thread of life untwisted 1 into its first consistencies the tales are full of those splendid epigrams and profound observations on life for which the author is notable the frenchman who in the course of twenty years had not succeeded in pronouncing his patrons name correctly is a true picture something of the sort prevailed in the treatment of russian names among ourselves in earlier times mrs bradford the lady who edited in 1840 the memoirs of princessdashkov calls her dashkaw throughout although she lived with her for some years this form of the name is impossible under any mode of transliteration we must adhere to what we have said on former occasions a few notes would have been useful for the general reader as to prince viazemsky griboiedov and araktcheev perhaps the russian expression  st nicholas on hens legs  p 149 as the name of a church would not seem so absurd if we remember the proverbial use of the phrase ie on a weak inadequate foundation or as it is expressed in the saying which comes from the russian popular stories a cottage on hens legs supported by a pie and roofed with a cake  izbushka na kuryikh nozhkakh pirogom pod perta blinom pokrita  it is probable that mr garnett who writes the prefaces to these volumes is mistaken in supposing that the novel is depreciated among us as a form of literature the dedication to stepniak revives the memory of that strange dreamy ineffectual man over whom the terrible circumstances in which he left his country cast such a melancholy shade,storie
night watches tijj by w w jacobs hodder  stoughton 3s gd mr jacobs has by no means lost his talent for invention and disposition of the wit and wisdom of the types and classes he has studied with such care we meet once more the  night watchman  ginger dick  and his two friends and sundry other excellent and diverting personages who provide the usual amusement it is true that some of the finer edge seems to have gone we no longer find such gems as occurred in sea urchins or the other earlier collections which bear rereading to any extent but the understudy  and  his other self  are worthy of the author at his best the grim side of his outlook is shown admirably in  the three sisters a most gruesome tale,storie

literature tifiq ilandican  beine stories of mine i own people by rudyard kipling macmillans mu kirueg has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as mr kiplings finest work the book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  the incarnation of krishna mulvaney the courting of dinah shadd  on greenhow hill  the man who was without benefit of clergy through the fire the finances of the gods and  little tobrah to these may be added the preface they deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the british army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character two stories  at the end of the passage  and  the mark of the boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of englishmen in india three more  the return of inray  bubbling well road and  bertran and bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility three the mutiny of the mavericks  the head of the district and  naingay doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them five more  the amirs homily jews in shushan  the limitations of pambe serang the city of dreadful night and  the dream of duncan parreness are mediocre examples of mr kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking the remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication the lang men o larut reingelder and the german flag  the wandering jew  moti guj  georgie porgie and  naboth the volume ends with some of mr kiplings best verses this is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices among the stories which i think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best but upon the whole i think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention the one great fault in mr kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view he insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive for example  the man who was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them all from bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title i hate to mutilate a book but i hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid i have obliterated the passage too often in reading mr kipling we are forced to say  that would make a good special report or  thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind but the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen i do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  i do say that mr kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause and from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonigues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered  the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever lie be by sea or by land what is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  it sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms these things are fatal to the perfection of a story and mr kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy but it may be observed that they do not occur except when mr kipling is dealing with english officers and civilians his common soldiers and his indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by mr kipling without these petty offences against good taste ortheris and mulvaney ameera and khoda dad khan in every mood or situation are allowed by mr kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the english gentleman in india his officers and his civil servants orde tallantire hummil spurstow lowudes mottram strickland and 1i one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which mr kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in india the empire the administration the government become in mr kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them the consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance ono thinks of dalhousie and of the lawrences mr kipling has had experience of english life and work in india his reader for the most part have not but i would ask any reader who has known english offlears and civilians before during anl after their indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of mr kipling is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with india they are natural englishmen but that an indian climate and a share in iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern atlas helping to uphold the indian empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  mr kipling presents english rule in india for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy in fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are though views expressed by his title lafe8 jihndicap you start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by the irony
