1 kissing the rod a novel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth novel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the heroines papawho is everywhere mentioned as a man of indubitable feshion although of scandalous immorality and walks about town with his usual easy swaggeris the obsequious toady of complaisant billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being forthwith recognised by the  aristocratic families of the neighbourhood  i with society of a different kind the same want i c of familiarity is displayed by the writer who   speaks of  mr tocsinqc the celebrated old  s bailey barrister as though the more conspi  cuous members of the old bailey bar were in  j the ordinary course of things wearers of silk   if  kissing the rod may be relied on the 1 world of fashion looks with no unfavourable   eye upon though old bailey bar but mr yates   makes a still more comic slip concerning the   ways and habits of lawyers when he puts  charles yeldham on the highest floor of a j  temple staircase sharing a set of chambers  i with gordon frere a young templar who j i bears a close resemblance to our old friend  i arthur pendennis charles yeldham is the j beneficent selfdenying heroic wifeless  good  fellow  of the tale the counterpart of george  warrington in temper and style charles i yeldham holds himself aloof from literature i and is a hardworking and very successful j conveyancer whose professional engagements are so oppressive that he never indulges in  more than five and a half hours of sleep out of  every twentyfour this celebrated conveyancer  does not only use the garret chambers as his residential quarters but he works in them his clients toil up to the  highest story to consult him he has no clerks room or clerk he has no pupils room or pupils before mr yates again tries his hand at a description of temple life he should take counsels opinion on one or two matters above all he should take counsel from friends who were neither slow nor cold in recognising the merits of his earlier stories and who sincerely regret the imperfections of his present book he clearly stands in need of repose and we urge him to rest now so that heand wemay be thankful for better work hereafter,britain_contra
an hungarian nabob at home and abroad by maurus jokai translated by r nisbet bain jarrold 6s rodman the boatsteerer and other stories by louis beoke fisher unwin 6s the ends of the earth are ransacked for the entertainment of the british reader of novels witness the two books before us taken as they stood on the shelf including a translated hungarian romance and a sheaf of south sea island tales maurus jokai is a writer who appears to impress his translators and not least of all mr nisbet bain very considerably we cannot say that an hungarian nabob although a national classic helps us very much to understand this fascination regarded merely as a series of scenes of hungarian country life it is exceedingly interesting the writing is vigorous picturesque and full of humour but we cannot bring ourselves to take it seriously as a great work of art or to class it as we observe from the publishers advertisements that other novels of his have been classed by other reviewers with the masterpieces of fielding scott dickens thackeray moliere and the elder dumas in the first place there is a great deal too much padding mr nisbet bain tells us that he has  taken the liberty to cut out a good third of the original work as he is strongly of opinion that the tale suffered from an excess of episode well it was a liberty on the part of a translator and moreover the tale suffers from an excess of episode still it gives one the effect of a book written for those who are not the authors countrymenwritten more to show what hungary is like than to tell a tale maurus joicai and secondly we cannot bring ourselves to regard either of the two principal charactersthe nabob john karpathy himself and his goodfornothing nephew abellino karpathyas in the least convincing the sudden conversion to respectability of the riotous old debauchee is untrue to life and his marriage with the girl fanny meyer to save her from abellino and spite his hopes of inheritance does not please us as a denouement there is any amount of native power in an hungarian nabob but the art of it is childish and barbaric the case of mr louis becke is otherwise here the barbarism is in the subject the art is quite trained and selfconscious mr becke knows his western pacific well and the curious hybrid life of natives and halfcastes and traders and derelict whites that haunts the shores of its fringed islands and ho tells his stories simply and incisively with an eye to the occasional touches of humanity and pathos which may serve to lighten up his rather sanguinary material the fault of the book is no doubt that it wears a little thin the types of character used and probably for that matter available are limited in number and the sort of things which happen to them mostly murders are somewhat limited also the result is that some of the motives are repeated and some of the stories have to do without motives if they were all as good as the escapee we should not grumble  an hungarian nabob by maurus j6kai translated by  r nisbet bain t this novel was published fifty years ago and the hungarian romancer has written countless tales since then but it is impossible to say that he has travelled very far from his early methods and ideals this story is particularly characteristic of lis special powcrs and though it is not the best of those that have been rendered in english it contains passages he has never surpassed an untiring inventiveness a bizarre humour an industry in the collection of materials from every source and a steady romantic light shining through all his effort these are the qualities which have won him fame outside his own country of course hungary owes him other debts he just misses being great for he has all the tenacity and the resourcefulness of dumas his cleverness is enormous but you can never call his best powers by a better name this is a story of oldfashioned hungary well worth reading for the insight it gives into the rough jollity the wild horseplay the barbarism and the simplicity amidst lavish extravagance that were features of hungarian country life in the old days the lively nabob john kihrpithy is a delightful personage we feel old hungary must hav died with him and we cannot echo all his pious desires that his little son may grow up ahogether unlike him mr bain confesses to have cut out a third of the book a third more than is given us would have made a very long story but then he might have cut more skilfully there are puzzling gaps not well bridged over at all and while we are grateful for what mr bain has done to render j6kai accessible to us and share not a little of his admiration for the hungarian romance writer we think lie is mistaken in his  intimate conviction that of all continental novelists lie is most likely to appeal to healthy english tastes at least he is mistaken in his dogmatic ution of it,britain_contra

evelyn innes by george moore fisher unwin we have an immense respect for mr george moore as a novelist tris patience his laboriousness his remarkable fidelity to the artistic light that is in him are rare and invaluable qualities in an age of facile production and ready compromise starting we should say with almost no initial equipment of genius for fiction he has worked his way by sheer dogged perseverance to a manner of expression and a point of view which though they may excite discussion cannot at least fail to rivet attention and enchain interest neither the expression nor the point of view indeed is or is likely to be in any ultimate sense personal to shake off critical preoccupations and to see absolutely for himself seems to be an impossible thing for mr moore but if you compare esther waters or evelyn innes whether for style or insight with some of the authors earlier work what an advance the student of human nature has acquired a real knowledge in some at least of the secret things of the heart the eye of the realist has been trained to discriminate and select to a perception of the significant instead of the obvious in the external shell of life and the pains devoted to mr moores style have not been without fruit verbal melody he generally misses grammatical correctnesssometimes there is no place in paris he will tell you  where you get abettor petite marmite than the ambassadeurs his sentences are frequently stiff and frequently jerky too short or too overloaded with coordination butand it is a big buthe has learned to paint to visualise to callup an image not of the outlines merely but of the atmosphere of a room of a garden of an environment here is one of fifty examples the broad walk was full of the colour of spring and its perfume the thick grass was like a carpet beneath their feet they had lingered by a pond and she had watched the little yachts carrying each a portent of her own success or failure the albert hall curved over tiie tops of the trees and sheep strayed through the deep may grass in arcadian peacefulness but the most vivid impression was when they had come upon a lawn stretching gently to the waters edge owen had feared the day was too cold for sitting out but at that moment the sun contradicted him with a broad warm gleam he had fetched two chairs from a pile stacked under a tree and sitting on that lawn swept by the shadow of softly moving trees they had talked an hour or more the scene came back to her as she sat looking into the fire she saw the spring easily victorious amid the low bushes capturing the rough branches of the elms one by one and the distant slopes of the park grey like a piece of faded tapestry and as in a tapestry the ducks came through the mist in long pulsing flight and when the day cleared the pea fowl were seen across the water sunning themselves on the high branches evelyn inns is an elaborate and minutely analytic study of the musical temperament the heroine is a singer of opera wagnerian opera she is one of those who as plato has it pipe away their souls in sweet and plaintive melodies her spiritual life is confined almost entirely to vague emotions and to such ideas as find their natural expression in musicideas very slightly intellectualised hardly raised above the level of sensations and emotions she drifts along through lifewith mr moore watching and studying her trying to disentangle and isolate the currents iii and out of a couple of liaisons and finally into the bosom of the holy catholic church precisely the same kind of mental processes determine her conversion as those which lead her out of the arms of one lover and into those of another this is the spirit of it   then to rid herself of the remembrance she thought of the joy she had experienced that morning at hearing in the creed that gods kingdom shall never pass away her soul had kindled like a flame and she had praised god crying to herself  thy kingdom shall last for ever and ever it had seemed to her that her soul had acquired kinship over all her faculties over all her senses for the time being it had ruled her utterly and so delicious was its subjection that she had not dared to move lest she should lose this sweet peace her lips had murmured au  our father but so slowly that the sanctus bell had rung before she had finished it nothing troubled her and the torrent of delight which had flowed into and gently overflowed her soul had intoxicated and absorbed her until it had seemed to her that there was nothing further for her to desire the interest of mr moores analysis is undeniable although we own to finding it a trifle too subjective and monotonous the young ladyjs fluctuations carry one rather often over the same ground and we fancy that a broader touch would have enabled mr moore to produce a really more vivid effect the background of the book is filled up with musical discussion skilfully designed to bring into contrast the two sides of music which attach it to the sensual life and the life of devotion respectively we do not presume to sound the depths of mr moores musical lore but we are not surprised that in dulwich  none remembered that dowlands was the name of henry the eighths favourite luteplayer surely his name was dowland and himself a contemporary not of henry but of elizabeth  evelyn innes by georsre moore fisher unwin  evelyn innes it may be remarked at the outset is the best novel which mr moore has yet written in grasp of character and in power of portraying an individual living being mr moore has advanced even since  esther waters of which the best characteristic was the presentation of the heroine but here still more one has the feeling that one is face to face with a reality and that evelyns actions have that inevitableness without which no interest is possible although this novel just as much as its predecessor is a novel with a topic music taking the place of betting as the phase of life on which the fortunes of the characters chiefly depend one is never made to feel that a single incident in the heroines life or a turn in her character is due to any desire on the part of the author to prove a point or elucidate a theory music is the real atmosphere in which evelyn and the other characters live and work out their destinies it is not as is so often the case in novels with a purpose the rarefied atmosphere of the philosopher making experiments on semianimate puppets to have studied music ancient and modern with the care and exactitude here displayed by the author and to have avoided the fault of allowing his subject to overpower his sense of character is in itself a great achievement and all praise is due to him for it but in awarding this praise one almost unconsciously stumbles across what spoils so much of mr moores work it is a great achievement but in almost everything that he does one is more impressed with the difficulty of his task and the labour required to surmount it than with the success great though it may be of his endeavours mr moore somewhere tells a story about himselfin the  confessions of a young man if we remember rightwhich seems to illustrate this characteristic in all his works when he first went to the louvre he tells us he saw no beauty in ingress  la source but manet or some painter whom he admired told him that it was beautiful convinced that his informant was right he went day after day to this picture to study it and find out wherein its beauty consisted until at last after a vast amount of conscientious study he really did find that the picture was most beautiful so in all his work one has a feeling that he is very often right and has attained to the end required but that it has cost him an unconscionable amount of trouble and study to attain it and he seems so proud of all the pains he has been at that he will not spare the reader any of the steps of the journey to his goal mr moore never seems to live anything if we may so put it he always studies it and learns it he has no intuition but he joins to great intelligence extraordinary laboriousbess which secures him the power of rarely making a mistake and as rarely enlightening by a flash of inspiration even with evelyn innes the most living and successful of his characters this may be observed she certainly is a living woman all her actions are perfectly right from her own nature but she is always an outsider a person to be observed not felt of all the greatest characters in fictionjane austens some of thackerays dickenss mr merediths it may be said that not only does the author seem to have lived them but the reader almost can identify himself with them and feel himself saying and doing what they say and do with evelyn inns mr moore may have been on terms of the most intimate acquaintance but he never felt himself in her and the reader also feels that what she does is quite natural from what he knows of her character just as he feels about his cousin or his aunt but he never realises her sufficiently to feel that he would necessarily do the same himself she is really living but she is not living in the most intimate way with though same limitations sir owen asher and ulick dean are wonderfully good up to a certain point they are people one would recognise immediately if one met them in the streetin fact one knows many like them but mr moores art adds nothing to our knowledge of them they are to a certain extent enigmas in life as all men are except perhaps one besides oneself and to just that extent and no less are they enigmas in the novel a consequence of mr moores inability to conceal his laborious methods is that however interesting in some respects his novels may be they are apt to become tiresomely prolix mr moor is crammed full of facts one may imagine him like zola studying for his novels from every available source as zola would have gone he has evidently been to bayreuth and to madame wagners house there he has studied the scores of wagners operas and wagner literature ad nauseam he has been to dulwich and to hyde park and kensington gardens  he has conscientiously paced every inch of the ground which he makes his characters cover but unlike zola he has not acquired the faculty of discarding unnecessary facts the frenchman knows as all frenchmen do that one of the first elements of art is to know when to be silent but mr moore will tell you that evelyn paid her hansom cabman when she left him he will weary you with discussions on wagner and bring in utterly irrelevant disquisitions on balzac in one passage he describes at some length a subscription concert got up by evelyn and in reading the description we wondered if he would add the exact amount secured by it for the charity and sure enough it was duly chronicled this is the reason why some reviewers cry out against disgusting passages in mr moores books now in this one there are some details which could certainly not be qualified as disgusting but which are absolutely unnecessary and which one would prefer not to have mentioned unless there were some very strong dramatic reason for doing so which there is not they are annoying here chiefly because they are so gratuitously unnecessary just as some of his long and inappropriate descriptions of scenes are tiresome they are only worse than the latter because they concern matters on which it is better to be reticent but their real fault is essentially the same that of irrelevance the book however which is worth criticising at such length just because it is so good as a whole and so admirably single in purpose and construction and so marvellous in the way in which all the interest is quite naturally focussed on the heroine must not be dismissed on a reproach the style though still a little lacking in nerve and decision is a great improvement on mr moores former writing and some of his phrases and jottings of character are decidedly pithy and poignant here is perhaps the best of them   lady ducklo appeared to her as one who had never selected a road she seemed to have walked a little way on all roads and her face expressed a life of many wanderings straying from place to place there was nothing as she said worth doing which she had not done but she had clearly accomplished nothing  evelyn innes when sir owen the artistic baronet begins evelyns education seriously in paris one of his first lessons is in balzac  there is a vulgarity he says to her  about those who dont know balzac we his worshippers recognise in each other a refinement of sense and a peculiar comprehension of life we are beings apart we are branded with the seal of that great mind you should hear us talk among ourselves further he says that each of balzacs fiftytwo volumes is a masterpiece now mr moores general methods in fiction do not forbid us to infer that through sir owens mouth he is expressing his own views at all events this personage does express views which mr moore has uttered in his own name such balzacian fanaticism one would hesitate to attribute to him were it not that his manner of working here and elsewhere convicts him of it for a dilettante baronet blind fanaticism is of no consequence but when one of the writingcraft forgets that the honour due to such an incomparable searcher of the human mind must be discriminate in order to be worthy the case is serious for imitation is bound to follow and it so happens that only balzacs weaknesses can be imitatedhis   evelyn innes by george moore 6s unwin formlessness his unjustified and unforgiveable loagxears his unrelieved monotony of manner the admiration for the masters genius has given to the native defects and misfortunes of mr moores talent the shelter and encouragement of a great name mr moore is sometimes reputed to be a dangerous writer but if he sins he does not sin lightly or insinuatingly let that be counted to his credit where it may he admires ciany french things and has learned some part of his craft in a french school yet never englishman was so deadly serious in manner at least there is not a smile anywhere in  evelyn innes not a vivaciousmovement not an unconsidered word but surely he must drive the most unsympathetic reader to unstinted admiration of the work he puts into his books when one compares the quantity and the quality with that

frous 4 pakinuis by maxet rproduced by kuxd permission oj musm waiter scott lal to the shape of his boots that of every opinion held by his personages he should be the historian and interpreter capable of writing a leading article on it that every scene should have the local definiteness of modern stage directions that every street or house should be precisely entered in a full catalogue or inventory and he hardly falls short of that ideal with magnificent patience and honest slogging endeavour is his task pulled through when he has to get up a subject he does so without flimsiness this latest novel for instance should be a mine of interest to students of the older music and to admirers of mr dolmetsch his wagner criticism is able and suggestive and of course very timely at the present moment unquestionably he has a rare and admirable respect for his work about the result there will be much difference of opinion to me his manner and method are unpleasing and the abnegation of all art and i feel it much more in  evelyn innes than ia  esther waters where the form and temper were more flaubertianand flaubert if a  little master is a safer guide for mr moore than balzac who tempts him to longwindedness but still he has only exaggerated the course which his kind of temperament his quality of vision must have forced him to take at his best lie is an unsurpassed

sir owen told her she was  intensely balzacian very likely the creator of eugenie grandet might have made her comprehensible nothing could be more detailed and more superficially definite than her history as given by mr moore but she is a blur to one careful reader at least at the beginning she lives a shabby and obscure life without ambition though she knows she has a great voice then she agrees to a lse with sir owen a little for love perhaps not a little for fine clothes and fine living and a little for the sake of her voice sir owen gives her rationalistic instruction which does not enter deep into her system she becomes a great singer of great partsisolde kundry briinnhilde then she falls under the more spiritual influence of ulick but his mysticism does not satisfy her then with a thought to her soul she gives up the stage in the midst of her triumph in her convent retreat we think her fate is settled at last but no she comes out into the world again quite aimless what is she meant to be  one leaves her with the idea that she was very stupidbut stupid as are those sensitivists on whom scientific hypnotists experiment most successfully yet we gather that mr moore had some other intention in presenting herthat to him she was a rersonality something has missed his nervous subject fdgeted under the fire of the camera a m  literary bulletin books eviryx inure bv

new novel the pools of silence by h de vere stacpoole fisher unwin mr stacfoole advances his reputation as a writer of romance by this brilliant and showy narrative inspired by indignation at the atrocities recently committed under cover of civilization in the congo by belgians his hero is an american doctor who accompanies a sportsman named berselius with a lust for cruelty on a hunting expedition in that country while the americans back is turned berselius feasts his eyes on the horrible punishments inflicted on some natives by a belgian chef de poste who meets with terrible retribution the book abounds with shocks and surprises ministering to a simple and ordinary curiosity but conveyed with much literary skill berselius halfhero halfdevil is a fascinating character the book despite frightful scenes such as those preceding the death of a cannibal guide is essentially the outcome of a poetic mind whose deliverances are characterized we may add by an oracular manner reminiscent of victor hugo  the pools of silence by h de vere stacpoole t fisher unwin 6s mr stacpoole has succeeded as is usual with him in writing a strong and very readable storv but he has weakened it by bringing in a  cause  few novelists can venture to do this and at the same time retain a high level of interest he attacks the congo administration and makes a good many sweeping statements which can hardly be profitably discussed in a review but which in fairness we must say he seems to substantiate by referring to various authorities apart from this the story is a study of a mighty hunter one berselius who after spells of civilised life in paris hears the call of the tropical forest and sets forth after big game ostensibly but really to satisfy his lust of killing his nature is essentially ferocious and bloodthirsty from the point of view of dr paul quincy adams a man who becomes his travelling medical adviser and assistant the plot is unfolded and up to a certain incident the attention of the reader is held irresistibly then with the stampede of a herd of elephants in which berselius is knocked down and loses his memory the whole thing becomes tame and unconvincing mr stacpooles good fairy seems to desert him and the result is disappointment the paragraphs of description in the book are often very fine even if they are sometimes a trifle strained the effect is at least original awe may instance a few lines from the first page the sun was setting over paris a bloodred and violentlooking sun like the face of a bully staring in at the window of a vast chill room the bank of cloud above the west corrugated by the wind seemed not unlike the lowermost slats of a venetian blind one might have fancied that a great finger had tilted them up whilst the red callous cruel face took a last peep at the frostbitten city the frostbound countrvamontmartre and its windows winking and bloodshot bercy and its barges notre dame where icicles large as carrots hung from the lips of the gargoyles and the seine clipping the citd and flowing to the clean but distant sea everybody may not care for so urgent and unpoetic a metaphor as that exploited in the opening lines but not many people will miss reading it  the pools of silence  does not rise we think to the level of some of mr stacpooles previous work but it is certainly a relief from the ordinary course of fiction and if the author would drop his irritating habit of using a comna when a semicolon is demanded the pleasure of many to whom these things make a difference would be increased,britain_contra

technique and earnest thought the present book will certainly not lessen that reputation it is a good interesting story not too original in plot perhaps although the central dramatic point of a deliberate overdose of morphia given to put an end to hopeless pain is far from being commonplace the main interest of the story lies in the development of the characters of amherst and bessy and here there is just a point of criticism to be made bessy and amherst fall hopelessly in love with each other so hopelessly on her side that she is willing temporarily at any rate to sacrifice her own interests to the object of his life the improvement of the conditions of labour at her mills her nature is not strong enough to endure the selfdenial although her love for him remains as strong asever on his side on the contrary his love for her weakens as he sees her interest in his work fade unless he appeals to her love for him this he refuses eventually to do   ill do anything    she sobbed and in the darkness he held her to him and hated his victory this attitude would have been natural had amherst simply married bessy in order to achieve his social and economic ideals but mrs wharton does not we think mean this in fact she clearly hintsthat their marriage was due to love mainly if not alone amhersts attitude towards his wife is therefore slightly inconsistent and his character is weakened accordingly in justine we are also a little disappointed at first she is intensely interestinga strong and compelling picture of the modern working woman but her weaknessonly temporary admittedlyis inconsistent with her strength both earlier and later in the story the other characters in the story are neat and effective thumbnail sketches of american society drawn with the sure knowledge that comes from intimate acquaintance with the originals it must not however be thought from this criticism that we wish to underrate in any way the worth of mrs whartons story on the contrary we are of opinionthat it is in many respects a good novelfar above the average of modern fiction but mrs whartons work is good enough to stand detailed criticism and faults which in a less

chun tikung his life and adventures chinese stories by claude a rees heinemannstories connected with china have appeared of late in considerable numbers and the adventures of individual chinamen have been described with more or less verisimilitude from almost every point of view though instances have it is true occurred in real life in which chinamen have married english wives the experiments have not been successful and so far as we are aware in every case the lady has met with bitter disappointment on her arrival in china though only known instance in which a wife of the english race has found chinese surroundings congenial to her is that of an australian lady who is now living in the neighbourhood of foochow in perfect contentment with her adopted country and her pigtailed husband in the work before us the hero who is the son of a coffin maker is adopted by a childless uncle holding the office of taotai and after passing the necessary examinations with exceptional distinction he is appointed secretary to the chinese legation in london while here although already married in china he falls desperately in love with a miss nellie serjeant who strange to say returns his affection the proposed match naturally arouses considerable opposition in the sergeant family but in the end love triumphs and miss sergeant becomes in due course the second mrs chun the rest of the story is not a pleasant one while chun makes every endeavour to prevent nellie from becoming aware of the existence of his first wife she goes through the various stages of disillusionment until her chinese rival forces her way into the room where she is prostrated with fever and denounces her as a usurper in the affections of her husband frenzied with grief and shame she carries her newly born infant to the neighbouring creek and plunges into the tide the story is told well and interestingly and considerable pains have evidently been taken to make the incidents conform as much as possible to chinese manners and customs to say that in all instances they do so would be to say that mr rees has performed a miracle so few foreigners have ever penetrated into the inner life of the chinese that it is not to be expected that in the present volume in spite of a considerable amount of local colouring there should be a minutely accurate picture of native domestic scenes but enough has been done to make the book readable and the plot plausible a marriage in china by mrs archibald little a e n bewicke white  co is not the first work on china that we owe to the pen of mrs little  my diary in a chinese farm which lately appeared contained her description of a summer residence in the neighbourhood of the gorges on the yangtsze spoken of in the present work  but compared with that book this volume is of a far more pretentious nature it is a novel of 312 closely printed pages the scene of which is laid in china and the author has brought her long experience of chinese life and manners to add colour to her subject to all those interested in cathay the book will be welcome  but it may be doubted whether  the general public  will be deeply stirred by it the characters are not drawn with sufficient vigour strength and distinctness to make them generally interesting and in the plot there is nothing to fix the attention or to excite sustained interest the hero mr fortescue is a consul in china who has made a companion of a young chinese girl by whom he has two children while temporarily severed from his social entanglements he visits england where he makes the acquaintance of a miss grey who is residing with her aunt at northampton for this young lady he forms an attachment and finding it hard to struggle against his feelings takes to flight in course of time miss grey is left alone by the death of her aunt and falling under the influence of a mrs betterton a lady missionary in china she goes to the  flowery land  to make converts and as events prove to meet mr fortescue at first he thinks it best to avoid her but circumstances being too strong for him he falls again under her influence and offers her marriage the offer is accepted and the story ends by the fortescues taking charge of the two eurasian children and by the marriage of their mother with a portuguese resident mr fortescue is represented as being highly intellectual a sceptic as far as christianity is concerned and with a strong leaning towards taoism probably his character is the one which the author has intended to draw with most distinctness but he is after all too shadowy to make a strong impression and his strange vagaries in moments of repent a0ce and selfreproach are too erratic to be natural to residents in china some of the scenes will be very familiar and it is even possible to identify several of the characters as real personages in fact the book reads like a narration of actual facts but it is somewhat wanting ing an tne english is not in every instance all that could be desired such phrases ashe could not help but know i wished it in the mouth of the heroine and  what we bring the girls we say we love to  are awkward and some descriptive passages would be better for revision for example in the account of the struggles of the boatmen in the heroines passage through the yangtsze rapids we meet with such a passage as the following 44 evidently the boat must have been caught by one of those sudden geysers that rise up unexpectedly in midyangtsze like a waterspout creating a new whirlpool for the moment whatever it was there was the boat below turning and worse  over now  four of them in a confused knot the fifth caught with his hands at the edge of the cliff then was jerked and flung down after the others the sixth just saved himself by lying sprawling on the road  the rest by giving way a little going back with the boat then tugging with might and main seemed getting the boat out of the whirlpool when the towline gave and they were all thrown forward on their faces against the cliff the picture of life in china which the author draws is not an attractive one and we would fain hope that the climate on the yangtsze is not so unfavourable to european life that the mobs are not quite so aggressive and that the missionaries are not so unfavourably placed as she represents them chinchinjvaby charles hannan frgs constable  co is a volume of short stories two of which are chinese three indian and the remaining three european they are extremely light and as far as they go are well and amusingly told when looking abroad for his inspirations the author has not troubled himself over much to make acquaintance with the manners and customs of the people of whom he writes and probably he would consider such a study superfluous the book is of a kind that might while away the tedium of a railway journey or help to relieve the monotony of a sick room but it would seem to require the environment of boredom to make it really acceptable there is little that is new in the situations which are described and the stories want point and finish  chun tikung his life and adventures by claude a rees wm heinemann among the joys or terrors of classical youth are a pair of novels called gallus and charicm hythe worthy becker as stories they fail in after life to convince being concerned with the adventures of a model young roman and a model young greek amid a series of reconstructed social scenes of their respective times these are the nearest things we can think of for comparison with chun tikung the tale of a model young chinaman whether however the description of chinese life and manners which is the object of the book will prove as acceptable or enduring as the aforementioned classics is another matter we doubt it having regard to the indifference of the west towards eastern customs moreover this is a work of far inferior skill chun tikung is an ordinary chinese prig without distinction of history or merit adopted by an impossibly advanced and benevolent uncle he travels along a river is brought into contact with dubious characters joins an expedition against pirates and takes the  hanlin degree after this he comes to england as interpreter to the embassy and from that point the story diverges entirely into a new channel he deceives and marries an english girl having already a wife and son in china he brings her back with him and after many uninteresting complications leaves her to hear the truth the very instant that her child is born by way of a finish the unhappy woman drowns herself and the newborn infant if this is the story proper the introduction is preposterous if the first part of the book is the gist this farfetched addition is irrelevant,britain_contra

a mine of wealth and the rehabilitation of the heart of midlothian may be traced to the fortunate circumstance of his accidental purchase of the volume which contained that and several other kindred pamphlets of the day miss strickland follows somewhat in his footsteps in using up the  diurnalls  and merculries of the early period of the great parliamentary struggle with king charles for the supremacy but miss strickland tells a storya clever story it is true she does not write a novel her  lives of the queens of england anid her queens of scotland have so fixed the narrative style as her medium of communication with her readers that many of the scenes in  how will it end  instead of standing out in the boldness of a drama with the stir and pulse of life and a marked individuality of characterthe truest test of the novelists powerare but the representations of what the author has witnessed not the scene itself to which she wishes her reader to accompany her take for example this description of chester and its inns at the time of the opening scene of the tale lady woodville and her daughter the heroine of the story are on their way to westmoreland and have to pass through chester then one of the royalist strongholds the coach drove to the edgar then a very large imposinglooking inn but it was full to overflowing  to the bear and billet with no better success george lawton rode up to the coach wvindow and reverentially raising his cap to lady woodville said  madam your ladyship can have quiet comfortable quarters at the old pilgrims iun corner of st werburghs lane lady woodille though the widow of a distinguished cavalier commander was the daughter of a puritan family and strongly imbued with the prejudices implanted by her early training she turned pettishly away exclaimingg ii will have nought to do with saints pilgrims and papists  tat  my lady exclaimed george bluntly there are not many saints here i trow though belike a few papists but as for pilgrims they be clean out of date but there used to be a sort of them and the inn whereof i speak was built on purpose for them in the good old times it still bears the same name and is much frequented by the cheshire clergy which proves it is all right and its kept by jane tuffkyn a godly widow who goeth daily to early prayers in the cathedral with her maidens and the house goeth on all the better for it so with your leave my lady ill tell the coachman to drive you and my young lady there h old  said lady woodville are there none other inns in chester   two score and upwards ill warrant you my lady replied george who was himself a chester man  there is the golden falcon the pied bull the red dragon the black lion the pig and whistle the legs of man and many more but they are all full of the wild irish and welsh recruits  horrid outlandish papists who come to england to cut protestant throats  shrieked lady woodvilles maid margery sure my lady we are not going to shut up doors with the like  oh me my lady what is to become of us poor maidens ejaculated millicent hill altheas damsel but she was instantly silenced by her young mistress bidding her hold her peace and not increase their trouble by her folly then turning to lady woodville althea entreated her to permit them to proceed to the inn recommended by george lady woodville signified her consent by an ungracious inclination of her head and george gave the word to the coachman to proceed riding himself at the head of the horses to lead the way it was with difficulty they pierced the crowd that had gathered round the each during the stoppage caused by lady woodvilles dialogue with george it was marketday to and the country people who had brought their produce into chester for sale eagely beset the coach inspired with hopes of cusom boding up betches of carrots kail lee and ropes of onions and clamoously enfrjg th ladies to buy in a dialect wholly inteligble to them george lawton at length i i i succeeded in clearing a passage for the coach and it drew up before an antique house of entertainment with open galleries to the first floor supported by carved oaken pilasters surmounted by cornices or bargeboards whereon were represented in rude sculpture various episodes in the legendary history of saint werburga the fame of whose alleged miracles had during the mediaeval ages been the means of attracting crowds of pilgrims of all degrees to pay their votive offerings at her shrine those who are satisfied with the narrative instead of the dramatic novel may probably like miss stricklands delineation of character the language on the whole is smooth and the incidents possess considerable interest but the characters are simply marionettes and the voice of the showman becomes even when musical too monotonous to rivet the attention of the listener for the length of time during which the performance lasts lady woodville is the widow of sir lionel woodville a staunch royalist knight of lancefielci court in the county of salop althea their only chiid is heiress to large property but not being yet of age colonel briggs the puritan nephew of lady wvoodville is appointed by her mother

the bride elect 3 vols newby this novel without any very great pretensions or lofty aim certainly merits perusal and that is more than can be predicated of the majority of the works of fiction that have appeared this autumn some indeed are so utterly flimsy that we have not deemed it worth while to honour them even with a passing comment the object of the authoress is to expose thc worthlessness and criminality of that most fri volous and despicable animal a male flirt there certainly can be but one opinion on such a subject consequently no amount of odium will be deemed too great to mark the infamy of such wretches fortunately however at the present day they are not found to exist in any considerable numbers mrs ashton the widow of a general had possessed great beauty which her three daugh tera inherited they resided in a pretty villa at kensington were well connected well introduced and enjoyed sufficient means to enable them to indulge in many of the amenities of life mrs ashtons income being however entailed on a nephew it was incumbent upon herin the phraseology of the worldto get her daughters married as speedily as practicable for her sake as well as their own three fair and accomplished damsels mixing much in society of course elicited considerable admiration and ashton villa was the constant resort of a number of danglersmen as we find them here designated of unmeaning attentions or pertaining to the detrimental race the only check upon these frivolous and injurious intimacies was found in a bachelor uncle a mr percy ashton who looking upon his sisterinlaw as a weak fool and his nieces as romantic simpletons was constantly taking them to task upon the subject the old gentleman estimating in its proper light the conduct of these idlers from having half a century previously occupied himself in a similar disreputable manner a beau of the old school mr percy ashton was a small man very erect and with a head so bald that his very large organs of selfesteem and combativeness stood out in alarming relief he was a very fair man naturally and the few hairs time had not thought it worth his while to steal were like his eyebrows and eyelashes snowy white  his eyes were of the lightest blue and of a keen phosphoric brightness  bis teeth beautifully white and even his hands soft fair and taper as the most delicate ladys and kept with a nicety almost feminine in its precision  for unless the halfmoon of each pink and filbert nail was clearly defined old percy ashton was in a perfect fidget in his dress he was as particular as in his person no speck of dust or mud was ever seen on his black dresscoat of superfine cloth his pantaloonsfor ho scorned trousers  or his glistening shoes his linen seemed as if it had been got up by the fairies so fine so white so clear and the plaits of his frilled shirt and small ruffles so even and minute he was very proud of a fine leg and a small and beautiful foot and with the singular whiteness of his face and hands his snowy linen and exquisite neatness and cleanliness his brilliant brooch and ring and his very courtly and aristocratic bearing no one could pass him unnoticed or fail to regret that so very few specimens remain of the london gentleman of the old school he was a constant visitor at the little villa and a great favourite with his pretty nieces penelope blanche and isabel each of whom had respectively for cavalier bernard brydges trevor templeton and captain beresford although extremely assiduous in flirtation none of these gentlemen are in any degree earnest in their attentions yet each poor girl fancies that her young affections are ardently reciprocated hy her pseudo lover and firmly believes that the all important proposal is only deferred on account of some temporary obstacle bernard brydges is a young man of prcpos sessing exterior fascinating manners small means and no expectations trevor templeton an undergraduate at oxfordthough a very bad specimen of his classresembles brydges in several respects but has the additional advantage of a wealthy uncle with a daughter and a rich advowson both from his earliest youth destined for himself beresford depicted with the ordinary conventional characteristics of that class of army men who have no intention of seeing service is besides a litterateur in a small way with an opinion of himself by no means justified by his successes as an author all three are vain selfish and unprincipled to a degree caring little what pain they may inflict on such hapless maidens as may fall in their way so long as they amuse themselves and add to the boasted number of their victims old percy well aware of the danger his fair protegees are daily incurring cautions them and their mother as to their conduct at a ball and at the same time takes occasion to inveigh strongly against that ungraceful and odious mixture of a jig and a hug the polkaa dance now happily all but banished by the good sense of the community to thirdrate coteries and casinos percy ashton loquitur the polka at the last ball i went toa fancy balla powdered beau of george the seconds time was polking with a pretty swiss peasant with braided black hair anda bunch of scarlet flowers in her bosom  her black hair was powdered too before the end of the polka and on his white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold the print of her scarlet flowers was taken as by transfer i leave you to judge what sort of a dance that must have been how the ladys and gentlemans heads must have come together and how close must have been the contact to leave on his breast the print of the flowers in hers oh its odious its degrading its indecent even and worse still its vulgar ugly inelegant a girl never looks so awkwarknever seems so littleas when shes being jogged along in the hideous innovation on all our national feelingsi will not say prejudices in england too its so badly done such a clumsy exaggeration such a caricature oh ive no patience with it it has been remarked that since the polka came into fashion matrimony has gone out spinsters are alarmingly on the increase and i dont wonder at it as the cleverest woman i know said to me at that same ballthe girls of the present day begin where we used to leave off i e with an embrace the severest thing that has been said yet well said isabel i quite agree with uncle percy and that is the reason i never will dance the polka the authoress is especially severe against this dance and on another occasion observes  i do believe that odious polka has put the finishing stroke to womans influence and mans reverence for the sex it has broken down the wild sweetbriery fence it is so much to beautys interest to keep unimpaired it throws her a cheap burthen into the arms of a succession of supercilious puppies and it is so very inelegant a dance that she loses caste not only with her partner but with all the men who look on to sneer but not to admire  well it is a vulgar ugly dance enough and ouch a bore i dont care how soon it goes out im no very devoted squire of dames and really i do not wish to carry a heavy girl in a sort of halfjig halfhug with her head on my shoulder and then be expected to follow it up aux petits soins for ever after till though day of my death or marriagemuch the same thing one george addington a banker with

creepers close to london or some fashionable wateringplace with good society and plenty a double coachhouse and a conservatory in short a cottage of gentilityis pleasant enough for a  honeymoon that is the only sort of cottage in which lovethe love of a certain classcan condescend to dwell it has been often tried and is always a miserable failure the love that would last through life when

will be to make myself worthy of the honour you have done me had mr addington been more experienced in womankind he would have known that this kind fluent and amiable language was not that of a fond weak womans heart but of a clever womans head there was none of the faltering confusion the fascinating tautology the fearful joythe fear the shame the bliss almost painful in its intensity the thoughts too deep for utterance the feelings all too delicate for words mr addington was far too much in love all banker as he was to have a notion at that moment except of his own rapture and his brides condescension he tried to take the hand she extended to him he tried to speak his gratitude but he was far too much overcome for eloquence and so after exclaiming  oh miss ashton iyouall the

she certainly wasbut ashamed too of feeling so little when the man she had accepted as a husband felt so much with his handkerchief still to his face he rose and went to the window and for some minutes penelope could see by the heaving of his breast as she stole a view of him en profile that ho was mastering great emotion  he is to be my husband she thought and therefore i must act as if i

entirely centred in her son during her stay at addington lodge a few miles from brighton penelope discovers that bernard brydges between whom and herself all communication has recently ceased is residing at brighton she contrives and obtains more than one interview with the man who still holds undivided possession of her heart hoping that she may yet induce him to aid her in escaping from a fate in spite of its brilliancy becoming more odious the nearer it approaches she could bear that bernard should know she was going to marry mr addington she could not endure the thought that he should fancy she loved him she wished to be embalmed in his memory as a victim she could not tolerate the thought of figuring there as the contented prosperous affectionate wife of a middleaged banker and yet how could she undeceive him  had he not seen her weeping by mr addingtons side his arm round her waist her head on his shoulder what agony she felt at the idea that he would never believe that she had sacrificed herself it soon transpires however that brydges real object in haunting the same part of the country as his poor inamorata is not alas his love for her but a strong affection he has lately conceived for the shekels of miss addington a spinster of mature age frivolous disposition and very small personal attractions but with a reputed fortune of 70000 he contrives to obtain an introduction to the mother and an invitation to the same house in which penelope is staying poor miss ashton suddenly misinterprets the vile deceivers motives one day looking from her window mistaken motives she saw dora ridiculously overdressed and assuming the most jaunty coquetry of manner sporting about the lawn and along the shrubberies with bernard brydges she was followed by a little snowwhite french poodle that penelope had never seen before and which lier jealous heart suggested bernard had perhaps given but as she dressed herself in a new and elegant costume and as the glass reflected her cheeks hushed with emotion her eyes tull of passionate fire her form so proud and so perfect and the beauty over which love shed a lustre love alone can shed she contrasted her own exquisite grace and beauty with the little unshapen form gaudy attire sandy hair weak eyes and quaint absurdity of the figure ambling by bernards side and she felt ashamed of her own momentary jealousy had she in weighing herself and dora in the scale just put in seventy thousand pounds on doras sidethat sum in which bernard brydges whole soul is in reality wrapped uphow different would her deduction have been  poor dear bernard how he must love me to tolerate her and her odious advancesmiserable attempt at coquetry and wearisome affectations for my sake but ai in my side wlat nave  not

rae today various notes are interchanged penelope being eager to fathom brydges meaning while he is only anxious to lull her suspicions till he can elope with the  fortune that has awakened his cupidity one of these epistles to bernard brydges in penelopes hand is at last discovered and causes a frightful catastrophe the unlucky missive insisted on a meeting and an explanation early the following morning miss ashton appointed the place and she had determined to impart to her quondam admirer her resolution to break off the match with mr addington and to insist on bernards leaving her for ever unless he chose to accept the sacrifice she was so eager to make and to elope with her himself bernard brydges had however arranged a meeting of much more importance in his eyes mr addington and his mother came to the trysting place instead the eclaircis9ement it was a summerhouse that overlooked the road to london she waited for some time in miserable anxiety and impatience and bernard brydges did not come she began to fear he had deceived her burning shame dyed her cheeks anger and despair lighted her eyes and fired her breast she was about to leave the spot when the sound of carriagewheels in though road beneath attracted her attention  a postchaise and four dashed by the blinds were drawn down but one was suddenly raised and the face of dora looked up at the summerhouse yes dora waved her hand triumphantly to the bride elect bernard brydges shrank back in the carriage and hastily pulled down the blind penelope did not see his face but she did see his hand his white kid glove proclaiming the bridegroom oh there was not a doubt not a miserable doubt left he had been trifling with her keeping her quiet making a tool of her his sole object being that miserable halfwitted heiressno no there could be no doubt hannah is in the rumble with some jeering valet and both look up aud both laugh yes she sees them both laugh as fixed like a statue of despair her hair streaming in the damp morning air her form rigid her lips ana cheeks marblewhite and her hands tightly pressed upon her tortured bosom she stands at the entrance of that bower still looking wildly after the carriage and four round which rise such clouds of dustemblems as bernard thinks and whispers to the enraptured dora of what he would compel her brother to come down with slowly penelope turns with shivering horror and prepares to leave the spot as she does so she utters a faint cry for the first objects that meet her eye are mr addington and his mother she sees in a moment that they know all he is ghastly pale but stern and haughty and in his just indignation he looks almost dignified in his hands he holdsoh god yes it is her own note he held it out to her she tried to take it but a sharp cry burst from her lips her eyes flashed wildly all her features worked her limbs became convulsed she attempted to speak but could not articulate presently her knees shook her arms

illness recovers her health but her reason has fled for ever brydges finds that his wifes fortune is notas lu fondly anticipated at her sole disposal but entirely dependent on the will of her brother who generously allows the newlymarried couple 2007 a month to be paid to her so long as they lived happily together but to be paid to her alone if a separation should at any time take place between them we shall leave our readers to discover for themselves the histories of isabel and blanche together with the fate of their two graceless lovers merely adding that the respectable banker unites himself and his fortune to the amiable daughter of a poor clergyman the poor girl having long secretly entertained a passion for him the novel is written in an amusing style though here and there we detect errors not unfrequent in works of the class to which this pertains the more prominent attributes of the male characters in order that they may appear more striking are overdrawn and the language they are now and then made to utter is such as could never in reality have been used by gentlemen imagine for a moment any oxford man above the rank of a college  scout accosting the young lady to whom he is presumed to be paying his addresses in such insulting words as these  i say blanche whats the matter with pen  has bernard brydges moved off and has the old lady been kicking up a shindy  i could have told them bernard was no go ihe s not made for double harness and with all his pretence of love and sentiment tin is his idol and by jove he s righttake my word for it such expressions would hardly be tolerated in the servants hall at any rate no lady with english blood in her veins would ever admit a second time to her boudoir a brute who could demean himself thus grossly we might quote several other passages of a similar character but we shall content ourselves with one it is an extract from a letter of the same oxford man 441 say old boy dont you wish she may get it the old cat keeps aloof and lets me do much as i like with her pretty and playful little kitten shethe old pussis lpatle dc velours now but i suspect no mouse ever had a sharper run for bis life than i shall have for my liberty when she discovers that i dont mean to let her and her daughter  walk into nie and my good living what fangs and claws then old boy wont it be glorious sport  there are however other perhaps somewhat more venial errors which should also be sedulously avoided on future occasions since they can only be attributable to the ignorance of the writer or the carelessness of the printers  reader the authoress in her dedication to her brother professes  a truly feminine reverence for his finished scholarship c c we think it would not be amiss were she the next time she publishes to submit her proofsheets to that gentlemans critical eye her readers then would probably be spared such sad blunders as these  it was pain to give you up but to give up stultz hoby verey et cetera omnibus  would be greater pain still  bernard brydges possessed all the minor virtues in perfection punctuality politeness neatness order cleanliness et cetera paribus   lamour

captain beresford we are repeatedly told is a comet in the dragoon guards how are we to reconcile this anomaly  however notwithstanding numerous similar errors the intention of the writer is evidently

abroad his mother wm a maaging woman and ruled his ftherr which in very early youth excited the sons indignation and roused his resistance and made him watchful against all attempts of her to guide or influence himeven to a degree of obstinacy and contradictoriness it became enough if she proposed for him to refuse and though she was cunning and changed her ground he pursued her changes with a jealousy equal to her cunning hit pride was fully awakened he fairly took the bit in his mouth and ran his own course with others he was sometimes forgetfully confiding but almost every connexion he made in one way or other diappointing him added fuel to his sensitive temfrper and brought on confirmed distrust before he was of age he accompanied some friends abroad where at a gaming establishment hie met with a lady of the most captivating nmanners and enchantments and her he brought home and in the enthusiasm of his admiration and to assert his independence would have married lost as she notoriously was to a11 charatter the lady was one who had changed proprietors frequently and now accepted de libles protection as a matter of accommodation and to his surprise mortification and disgust left him as sooii as she found a change more agreeable this desertion had a most deciding effect on his after character and conduct on coming of age on the urgency of his parents he became candidate for his native county and the tricks and treacheries and venalities he witnessed inflicted another shock on the delicacy and sincerity of his sentiments and the losa of the election only added another rivet to the distrust which was beginning to extend towards the whole human race he was now without occupation and an object and with all his apparent strength of character the sport of every wind that blew his present indecisions ended in accompanying some friends one of them an invalid to the south and he seemed to be recovering an interest in life and society when both his friends perished one by falling into the water skating and the other by flying to his rescue and he was thus again left a lonely being without an object fir regard and without a wish for life the last sad events exasperating his general feeling of disappointment though not calculated to add to his growing misanthropy by this time a dissolution comes round again and he is once more involved in an

refusal force on him a conviction of the imbecility of individual and independent effort and he resigns his seat with disgust augmented and ready to overflow and inundate all with whom he comes in contact the lady however who had first charmed hill though she had jilted him so cauelely had still a hold on his memory and ven on his affections and hearing something of her accidentally and at a loss also for occupation he resolves to go on the continent in search of hernot so much with any view of renewing the intercourse as to ascertain why she left him and if she had ever loved him he succeeds in tracing her and gathers from her her whole history a history which is told with the most graceful vivacity and though the story be in itself full of improbabilities yet is it facile to the

visited the grave and soothing the poor girl with his best efflorts reconciled her to life his hours were engrossed by her and in thus labouring to withdraw her from recollections of wretchedness he was led to pay her so much personal attention that the childs affections were passionately fixed upon him though his own were untouched she was preeminently beautiful confiding and de voted lie was now leaving rome and what could he do with his protigde  her fond trust and abandonment to himself embarrassed him she refused to live if he left her and though seeing the absurdity of her accompanying him the matter ended by his taking her with himand finally in her own ruin many months were now spent in travelling from place to place and at last when his return to england became imperative the thought struck him of placing her in a convent under the care of an abbess who was the sister of the friends he had lost some years before in a skating excursion and was well known to him the poor girl seeing the case inevitable consented mainly because it was his wish here she pined and finally on de libles letters growing if not cooler yet less frequent she sacrificed herself to despair and left the wretched de lisle the victim of remorse and a prey to new disgust time moves on and the bitterness of grief passes by with it and de lisle succeeds to the ample inheritance of his

the ragged trousered philanthropists bv robert tressall grant richards gs the author of this book evidently set out to avrite a socialistic tract but despite such a handicap has produced a story of vivid realism and grim humour concerning the lives of some avorkingmen who with himself were associated with a firm of house painters and decorators in a provincial town in the course of a aolume extending to nearly 400 pages he shows us the sordid lives of these men their opinions of other sections of humanity  their attitude towards politics in general and their views of socialism in particular we follow the author with interest as he faithfully records the hopes and fears that animate his comrades their fatalistic philosophy of life and their dull round of toil displayed in the avorkshop and by their relations with the  boss  and the foreman a zolaesque character nicknamed  old misery the struggle of the women is also depicted and thc tragedies of the children in homes where insecurity of work and ioav wages are an everpresent problem for the strongest to endure and the aveakest to abandon in despair easton a felloavavorker of tressalls arrives home dispirited and tired to find the household budget disorganised hythe accumulation of debt resulting from his periods of enforced unemployment his avise has struggled hard and bravely but the crisis has mastered all the strategy of poverty and she explains to easton iioav matters stand he listens and then in ignorance rather than anger taxes her with carelessness and neglect  the woman did not reply at once she was bending down over the cradle arranging thc coverings which the restless movements of the child had disordered she was crying silently unnoticed by her husband  for months pastin fact ever since the child was born she had been existing without sufficient food if easton was unemployed they had to stint themselves so as to avoid getting further into debt than was absolutely necessary when he was working they had to go short iii order to pay avliat they owed but of what there was easton himself without knowing it always had the greater share if he was at work she would pack into his dinnerbasket overnight the best there was in the house when he was out of work she often pretended as she gave him his meals that she had had hers while lie was out and all this timo the baby was draining her lifo away and her work was lieaer done she felt very weak and weary as she crouched over there crying furtively and trying not to let him see then the man still blind to the patient heroism of his avife again complains and the avoman gives vent to her pentup despair oh i am so tired  i am so tired i wish i could lie down somewhere and sleep and never wake up any more  we avish that miss pope into whose hands ave learn the manuscript of the novel came had bestoaved more time and care on it she tells us in a short preface that  it came from the pen of robert trossalf housepainter and signwriter who recorded his criticism of the present scheme of things until weary of the struggle he slipped out of it and that her task has been merely to cut away superfluous matter and repetition she has not done either duty satisfactorily repetition has not only escaped her pruningknife but there is also at least one apparent hiatus which rightly or wrongly we have debited her avith in the interests of novel  readers to whom the subject is little known it ought we think to have been explained that the descriptions deal with men masters and conditions of work and life far below the average and we feel a measure of sympathy with the impatience that his fellowworkers expressed at the authors socialistic discourses there is a measure of truth in the latters contention that they are not informed as to the rootcause of poverty the nearest ave get to it is that it is the outcome of private monopoly today it is too much the fashion to shelter the individual behind the system it is at least open to question avhether if workers secured control there avould be safetysecurity of decent life and fair avagesin numbers alone and no one can be blamed for questioning also avhether the more educated vorkingman should not educate his felloavs better before the majority take control nevertheless ave commend this work to the sociologist and the politician alike  while the general reader will find its pages a document of compelling interest and tragic stress it is a book that by no means should be overlooked or ignored  the ragged trousered philanthropists by robert tressall grant richards 6s net although this socalled novel is said to be the work of a deceased socialistic housepainter we strongly suspect a dual authorship the story of the bitter struggle of the poor painters who work for a slavedriving firm is terribly realistic the complete knowledge of the miserable conditions under which they lived is certainly firsthand the dialogue is of the kind not likely to be overheard loose jests oaths and curses with a perpetual use of the forbidden word it is a painful and possibly only too true picture of labour under its worst conditions but the real purpose of the book cannot be mistaken it is merely the repetition of wornout attacks on christianity and the exploitation of an impossible and utopian scheme of socialism in the form of speeches and lectures put into the mouth of the painter owen in a style and manner quite different from the rest of the bookin fact a rather weak essay on socialism laboured into the rough and ready dialogues of the workmen this weak and obvious device whether the work of the original author or not tends to spoil a book which at least has the merit of giving a remarkable glimpse of conditions of life which

robert dalby and his wortld of trouble being the early days of a connoisseur chapman and hall tinis is one of those books which under the form of fiction apparently describes the experiences of real life it is difficult to believe that the author is not recalling scenes through which ho has himself passed robert dalbys early days contain very similar incidents to those with which our street urchins are familiar but the interest of the story liesin the healthy and successful struggle of the boy with the difficulties of his position and in the love of art which prompted him to the effort narratives of this kind whether wholly true in fact or merely true to nature are always interesting and suggestive we like to hear of any boy who has fought his way upward in life and won distinction and we like especially to hear of one whose efforts have been lrompted by a passion for literature or art robert dalbys experiences are manifold he starts in life as a pariah gets his schooling from an old woman who when death overtakes her ii compelled to die in the tlar k biing too poor to afford a candle is employed by a dogfancier learns to read when a wh hatsboy oil a ropewalk becomes a swineherd then a kind of mudlark after which he is promoted by a relative and sells vegetables and tripe all this it will bel said is prosaic enough and so it would be if the story ran in the same groove throughout but dalby has an artists soul and in spite of this handtomouth lifo manages to cultivate his taste and to develop his genius there is poetry in the effort and the enthusiasm which urges him onward will attract the readers sympathy the boy lives for a long time upon twopence a day and eats his meals in the streets in one of the narrow lanes of the city which is no doubt intended for oxford lives an excellent french artist whose windows are filled with pencil drawings dalby has already tried oil painting and in the opinion of his critic the old woman with whom he lives has produced a poor melancholy daub the pencil sketches charm the boy and day after day it is his wont to take his meals within sight of them  i had given up painting in despair but i might succeed with the lead pencil notwithstanding intently i gazed on each sketch and anxiously noticed each peculiarity of style and the more i looked the more my interest increased and day by day the thought and hope of becoming an artist took stronger hold of me and became more firmly fixed in my mind one day to his horror ialby discovers a caricature of himself in the artists window  the resemblance was not to be mistaken there stood the little browncoat charity boy with an enormous piece of bread eating on both sides of his mouth simultaneously and forming on the whole the most ridiculous counterpart that could be obtruded on my conscious gsaze meanwhile the frenchman stands behind his screen to witness the boys amusement but he has mistaken the lad who bursts into tears at the sight the drawingmaster is sorry makes acquaintance with him and discovers that in heart at least he is like himself an artist so he invites him to his table and to his studio gives him pencils paper indiarubber and chalks and better still laid in my heart the beginning of that faith in goodness which has never since left me henceforth the boys career in spite of great vicissitudes is marked out as that of an artist and connoisseur in the course of it he learns the art of carving in stone and in wood he becomes a picture restorer gains the friendship of a print collector and acquires the secrets of his craft and at length having established himself as a picture buycr marries and settles in the hague and according to the custom in orthodox storybooks lives happily ever afterwards in passing through these different stages dalby falls into grotesque positions and meets with eccentric characters which are described with humour and graphic force the tale on the whole is real and lifelike but it has one defect robert dalby notwithstanding his associates and his education is represented as a youth of imnaculate virtue in the most trying circumstances he acts wisely and with moral propriety temptation never overpowers him difficulties never daunt him he makes no blunders and incurs no blame his acquaintances speedily became friends and almost every one who knows him is ready to do him good service there is something here flattering to human nature but is it natural no doubt there are many good fellows in the world and much true kindliness of heart no doubt too that genuine merit gains appreciation but robert dalbys world must be different from ours or he possesses the happy knack of overlooking his own foibles and the failings of his friends perhaps however i am forgetting that the book is thrown into the form of a novel and must not be regarded as a genuine auto biography joitx dexxis  robert dalby and his world of troubles being thejearly days of a connoisseur chapman  hall   robert dalby is on the whole a pleasant and wellwritten book its author does not quito overcome the difficulties which all taletellers must encounter who have a special object apart from the delineation of human life and character we take more interest in the life of robert dalby as a man than as an artist and sometimes feel that the narrative is arrested for the sake of developing the artprogress of its hero still patience is not too severely tried for the incidents in the book are numerous and though not overcharged are such as secure attention the style too is graphic and at times poetical without a tinge of exaggeration the rise of robert dalby from a condition of absolute want in the slums of oxford to comfort and independence as a professional connoisseur i3 told with great animation and with an effect all the more real because there is nothing about it ambitious or tricky the autobiographer thus sets out with touching and homely truth an incident of his povertystricken childhood his grandfather a poor scaffoldbuilder is dying in his chamber without even the comfort of a light  get up my boy get up cried my grandmother your poor grandfather is very ill go to the grocers and get a rushlight what a thing it is not to have a bit of candle good god what shall i do  let the child lie in his bed said my grandfather  it will give him his death to send him out such a night as this i shant be goe five minutes said i starting up and slipping on my clothes  ah i am afeard thee wont get served said my grandmother  being christmaseve the place will be crammed up to twelve oclock it was as my poor old guardian surmised the shop was full gathered about the counter stood a number of town people and college servants chatting with the grocer and his assistants who took no more notice of my order than if a cur had barked in the street oh that i had then possessed a little of that shrewdness which adversity has since taught me will any one believe me when i say it that it never struck me to go to another shop for my candle  but then i was only six years old with desperate efforts i made ever and anon for the counter and called out  a penny rushlight if you please sir au in vain i was elbowed by the fat college servants and gyps then would i shrink back in silence and endure for a time such agony of suspense as i have never since felt i tried the master i tried the dainty assistants i tried the porter all equally in vain large orders came tumbling in and i had in every instance to give way to my betters at length the clock struck twelve and the place became almost vacant only three old stagers remained determined to empty a bottle of brandy with the grocer before they sought their homes now again i rushed to the counter for they were rattling up the shutters and preparing to close at length my tremulous voice took effect the porter heard me  god bless my soul he exclaimed so as to be heard by the others if i dont believe this poor boy has been asking for a candle three mortal hours by the clock  a splendid order said the college butler  will cause a rise in tallow observed the grocers assistant  may be said the porter in an undertone to the foppish assistant  that the boy may prove as good a customer as some of the best of em tonight at least he pays for bis candle while some of your dons who order a cartload of goods take a world of credit and some of em never pay at allsaying which he handed me the candle after all the poor lad lets the candle slip from though paper in hi3 hand benumbed with frost and his old protector dies in darkness there is a good deal of humour too in the book the descriptions of the council of the charity school and of  my lords porter for instance are quietly telling of course

a japanese romance chiusingura or the loyal league a 7aypanere romance translated by frederick v dickins london allen and co waterloo place i88o the aesthetics of the present day who have practised the worship of all things japanese with a devotion hitherto unknown and who have done their very best to live up to their blue china ought to be rejoiced to welcome a translation of a japanese novel it is all very well to rave about the artistic productions of china and japan most artistic people confuse these two countries together in the most delightful manner but any knowledge of the literature of either land is unfortunately denied to any but the very limited number of scholars who can decypher the fantastic characters in which chinese philosophers and japanese poets have enshrined their thoughts true the chinaloving world has always been more or less intimately acquainted with that most precious and perfect flower of all romances the pathetic tale which lives upon willowpattern plates and which mr andrew lang has lately put into verse that all higherculture folk should know by heart heres a pot with a cot in a park in a park where the peachblossoms blew where the lovers eloped in the dark lived died and were changed into two bright birds that eternally flew through the boughs of the may as they sang tis a tale was undoubtedly true in the reign of the emperor liwang but this tale does not fascinating though it is satisfy all the cravings of the literary mind it was a great epoch therefore for those who were suffering under the acutest form of the anglojapanese mania when mr mitford published his  tales of old japan which were exceedingly charming and deservedly successful amongst these tales was a story perhaps the most thrilling of all the tales called the fortyseven ronins a more expanded form of this tale translated by mr frederick dickins with the title of  chiusingura or the loyal league was published in new york about four years ago and it is this translation which has just been republished with the same curious illustrations which are perhaps the most interesting examples of japanese art we have seen as in most other romances whether in fiction or in real life from the siege of troy to the latest thing in society scandal a woman was of course the chief cause of all the strange and fateful events which are set forth in the history of  the loyal league if the great moronaho count of musashi had not been foolish enough to fall in love with the lady kawovo the wife of yenya hanguwan he would not have quarrelled with the husband as he did nor have compassed his death in so crafty and cruel a manner but love that was first and last of all things made as we have it on the authority of mr swinburne so overmastered the heart of the shiutto for such was moronahos august title that he picked a quarrel with yenya hanguwan had him committed to prison and so arranged it that the unfortunate yenya was sentenced to perform the  happy despatch which he did invoking vengeance upon his murderer as a consequence his clansmen and retainers became ronins that is to say clansmen who were no longer in the service of a master and who lived a sort of lawless independent life as the chief of these clansmen yuranosoke was known to be very devoted to yenya and to have been present at his death when he invoked vengeance on the head of his murderer moronaho felt some alarm lest yuranosoke should attempt to avenge his master but to the surprise of every one yuranosoke seemed after his masters death to forget all about the occurrence and to be in no way moved by thoughts of vengeance he lived a careless dissolute life in which wine and lighthearted loveaffairs played a prominent part and generally conducted himself with such devotion to pleasure and such complete indifference to the memory of his murdered lord that moronahos suspicions were quite allayed and he ceased to trouble himself with any fears of revenge on the part of yuranosoke this was exactly what yuranosoke had wished he had assumed the manner of an abandoned man of pleasure merely to deceive moronaho going so far as to speak with indifference of the unavenged yenya before some servants of moronahos whom the shiutto had sent to spy upon him but when he perceived that moronahos fears were quite lulled he collected around him all the ronins who loved their masters memory and who thirsted for revenge and they plotted together how to take moronahos life after many and careful preparations they succeed in entering his castle by stealth at night and after a desperate resistance on the part of his men they succeed in capturing and killing moronaho whose head they cut off in triumph their lord is avenged the loyal league of the faithful ronins has accomplished its purpose  for ever and ever thus the tale concludes  shall the memory endure of these faithful clansmen and in the earnest hope that the story of their loyalty full bloom of the bambooleaf may remain a bright example as long as the dynasty of our rulers shall last has the following tale of their heroism been writ down in the  chiusingura nothing is certainly told of the final end of the ronins but in the story of the fortyseven ronins which is practically the same narrative we learn that for a long time the authorities were perplexed to know what to do with them so great was the sympathy felt everywhere for the brave men who had avenged their chieftain but that they were finally condemned to seppiku that is to killing themselves in a body which they accordingly accomplished at the tomb of their beloved lord lthis curious and powerful story is told at a length that will seem rather wearisome to european readers but anyone who has the patience to go steadily through the story of the  loyal league will feel well rewarded at the end by the exceeding beauty of many passages and the lofty if somewhat misguided heroism which animates the whole purpose of the tale the language is often very poetic indeed and the similes which abound in it are frequently very felicitous what happier and more poetic phrase could be devised for a highway robber than one whose home was no more fixed than the white crest of a wave   the specimens of japanese poetry contained in the appendix are exceedingly interesting  a japanese romance by clive holland tlodder  stoughton tins story of an englishmans brief union to a japanese girl in her own country scarcely justifies its title if the word  romance  is seriously meant in the lovepassages of somerville with violet desborough on the voyage out and his subsequent marriage with miosan the little servant of his host in nagasaki the ideal element is curiously lacking we have in either case to take the heros affection very much for granted and can hardly understand the motive or more correctly speaking the impulse leading to his action yet although somervilles character is hinted rather than portrayed we feel as the story progresses that there is unexpected cleverness in the superficial indication of the artistic kindly selfish temperament the book has little jretension to literary merit and the apanese words which besprinkle the pages are sometimes translated sometimes left in a whole sentence to the readers intuition in spite however of evident defects the story is interesting and japanese life and scenery are vividly described,britain_contra
  cripps the carrier cripps the carrier by r d blackmore london sampson low and co  cripps the carrier is not so good a novel as  lorna doone but then  lorna doone  may fairly be said to rank amongst the very best of the novels of our day that fall short of being really great novels indeed since the last of the immortal waverley novels came from the busy brain and active hand which having fought so long were to be so soon silenced the class of writings which though not absolutely historical romances were yet laid in a time and among people different from our own have not been over numerous  lorna doone  may claim a good position among them not indeed with esmond or with barry lyndon the cause of so many tours de force most notably george augustus salas clever  captain dangerous nor with the virginians even but belonging to the school of these and not unworthy with  the cloister and the hearth perhaps fitter comparison may be made for if the story of erasmus father and margaret of the redgold hair be greater the feeling that invests john ridd and his surroundings is more closely akin to the time in which the tale is placed than is mr reades work to days mediaeval it must be at once admitted that as never before mr blackmore wrote so good a novel as his romance of exmoor so never since has he approached very near to it but cripps the carrier is a much closer approach than its predecessor  alice lorraine is indeed very greatly its superior if it possesses many of mr blackmores distinctive defects it also boasts of most of his distinctive merits mr blackmores chief faults are a certain vagueness in his grasp of a story as an artistic whole a confusion and apparent incertitude dependent upon this as well as a tendency to diffuseness  and worst of all perhaps a habit of bringing many of his characters before his readers as if he assumed them to be already well acquainted and therefore deemed it unnecessary to further enlighten them for this reason and because the chief charm of mr blackmore lies in his great descriptive powers and his sharp and sudden analysis of nature more than in his power of telling a story he is seen at his best when he informs some single subject when as in  lorna doone  and  the maid of sker he tells his tale in the first person either as the person most interested therein or as some keen observer the reason for this is obvious enough that he is compelled to hold himself together as it were cannot allow himself to be so carried off into perpetual fresh woods and pastures new as is his wont in other cases moreover no matter how many characters he may bring upon his stage he is compelled to govern their actions by the observation of a single person whereas when dealing with them by himself he seems to get so interested in eaoh one as it arises as to for the time being lose all consciousness of the others the story and indeed all things beside in his anxiety to follow out the feelings of the puppet whose strings he happens at this moment to be pulling suddenly he remembers that he is not writing an exhaustive analysis of a human character and he hurries back with a start  to some other of his creations and in the frequent repetition of this process so much time is lost that the chronicle is at last if not exaotly brought to a lame and impotent conclusion at least considerably hurried and confused in its ending it would be indeed difficult to dramatise one of mr blackmores stories because there is in them so little of dramatic completeness as stories they are incomplete and incoherent as studies of character they are too often marked with sameness but in spite of these defects and the perhaps still greater one that his women are little more than names the fact still remains that it is his power as painter poet and philosopherfor he seems to exercise each of these capacities in his writingsthat make his works so praisedeserving between  lorna doone his greatest work and therefore containing the greater portion of his merits and  alice lorraine in which his defects were most marked  cripps the carrier may take a middle place but if not fairly made midmost then nearer to the latter than to the former novel the story is complicated and apparently impossible in its leading idea which is however simple enough the scene is laid in oxfordshire close to the university town the heroine grace oglander is carried off from her family by the family lawyer and villain of the story luke sharpe and hidden in a remote cottage she believing herself to be acting in obedience to her fathers wishesa belief induced by means of forged letters in her fathers name which tell her that he has been compelled to go to demeraraand to be thirty miles from oxford and her home instead of close at hand the object of this forced abduction has been on the part of the lawyer that she may marry his son christopher who will thus come in for her fortune but who is a manly young fellow wholly guiltless of art or part in his fathers plan luke sharp causes squire oglander to believe that his daughter has been murdered a belief that nearly kills the old man  but in the end the plot is discovered on account of christopher sharpes refusal to be a scoundrel and carry out his fathers plans grace is rescued by cripps the carrier lawyer sharp blows his own brains out and grace marries her lover russel overshute who does not however play any very prominent part in the story because like ivanhoe he is ill throughout the greater part of the tale the probability or improbability of the story need not bo discussed it is the right of the artist if he chooses and if his strength justify it to do as he likes in this matter that chloroform was not invented at the time does not destroy the interest in the chief event in the  tale of two cities that joan of arc did not die on the field of battle that mary stuart and elizabeth tudor never met do not alter the merits of schillers two great dramas  all that is demanded is that it shall appear to be possible and this the plot of  cripps the carrier seems scarcely to be it is overcrowded with figures a fact all the more regrettable because some are so excellent that it would have been better if the artistic force spent on the many others had been appropriated to their fuller development cripps the carrier himself the hero is a study worthy to stand by the side of  girt jan ridd  zacchary had a bright open face with a short nose of brave and comely cock a mouth large and pleasant and mild as a cows a strong square forehead and blue eyes of great vivacity and some humour he had true cripps hair like a hornbeam hedge in the month of january and a thick curly beard of good hay colour shaven into three scollops like a cloverheap his manner of standing and speaking and looking was sturdy and plain and resolute and he stuck ont his elbows and set his knuckles on his hips whenever both hands were empty the contrast between him and his clumsy

female characters definitionconveys the impression of a sweet as well as pretty girl who finally marries the best man in the book after her brother hardenow  this was a man of great power of mind and led up to a lofty standard pure unselfish good and grandso far as any grandeur can be in the human compoundwatchful over himself at almost every corner of his ways kind of heart and fond of children loving all simplicity quick to catch and glance the meaning of minds very different from his own subtle  also and deep to reason but never much inclined to argue he had a shy and very peculiar manner of turning his eyes away from even an undergraduate when his words did not command assent as sometimes happened with freshmen full of conceit from some great public school the manner of his mind was never to assert itself or enter into controversy he felt that no arguments would stir himself when he had solidly cast his thoughts and he had of all courtesies the rarestat any rate with englishmenthe courtesy of hoping that another could reason as well as himself in this honest and strenuous nature there was one deficiency the rev thomas hardenow copious of mind and active clear of memory and keen at every knot of scholarship patient and candid too and not at all intolerant yet could never reach the highest rank through want of native humour his view of things was nearly always anxious and earnesthis standingpoint so fixed and stable that every subject might be said to revolve on its own axis during its own revolution round him and the side that never presented itself as the ludicrous or lightsome one of this man as of the other the carrier gladly would more have been welcome had its author but seen fit that more should be given and none of the others quite console for lack of these but many command high praise if lawyer sharp be a somewhat impossible though skilfullydrawn villain his wife and son are each in their own way admirable of the many others that jostle

miss braddon had nothing to do the critics raved but aurora floyd was in demand at the shops we are not in a position to state how many stories of our authoress were cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet novel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to express by the phrase quiet novel a work such as the vicar of wakeifiold oriiiri ciniawinnsthe trollope series of fictionsreaders of contemporary romances will have met with dozeus of quiet novels with dialogue as enlightened as the cackle

find it a more or n unprofitable calling to glean in the districts off which mi bradlon has reaped a crop it would occur to us id reading the novel now before us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the composition of her later

seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the great mahseerthe  indian salmon socalled though he is one of the cyprinidse barbus tordoes not show sport in proportion to his size we have been seriously informed that he rises at the swallows as they skim the surface and may be taken by a hook baited with one but we do not endorse the statement among the characters to whom we are introduced is an old fakir the descendant of taj khan a former pathan ruler of the district whose story is well and touchingly told another story the  legend of the rajah chand sa and of the hundred headless horsemen is a good specimen of the still flourishing art of storytelling we have now probably said enough to

  nadir shah by sir mortimer durand with illustrations constable  co sir mortimer durand has fallen between the proverbial two stools he has written a biographical romance which is at once too romantic to be a real biography and too biographical to be a true romance he confesses that he adopted this form  after some doubt because he found that  the existing accounts of nadir shah whether persian or european are hardly the material from which exact history could now be written no doubt  exact history is rarely to be deduced from eighteenthcentury persian or any other chronicles but a tolerably accurate biography of the great turkman conqueror might have been compiled which would at least have proved a useful contribution to history and would have been valued by students and even by orientalists to whom sir mortimer durands persian scholarship is known to such the present work without a single reference to original authorities is of little interest beyond showing the conception of nadir shahs character and career which an able man formerly resident in teheran and acquainted with the persian sources has formed even this has too much of the obvious in it and offers scarcely any originality we accept unreservedly sir mortimer durands assurance that his story is not  inconsistent with known facts and that he has done his  best throughout to treat known facts with proper respect  but since  this book does not pretend to be a history there appears to be no obligation to treat it with proper respect from the historical or biographical point of view taken merely as a romance founded upon history with the design of giving  more life and colour  to the story of nadirs career the work suffers from overlearning most of the romances in which the manners and modes of thought of the east and its  local colour  are sought to be imparted have been failures there are very few who possess mr marmaduke pickthalls happy gift and though sir mortimer knows persian and has been fairly intimate with upperclass persians we doubt if he knows the people as for example prof brown knew them when he lived amongst them or if he can think in persian as mr pickthall thinks in arabic the result in the present case is that the reader who is probably unfamiliar with persian ways is annoyed by frequently occurring words which he cannot understand and requires a glossary which is not supplied  the romance is burdened with archaeology and the action hampered by an attempt at historical accuracy which nevertheless leaves the reader unconvinced those who are already interested in nadir shah will read this romance of his life with appreciation but not because it is romance those who know nothing about him or his time will be perpetually puzzled and irritated it is not the business of romance to teach history and the mistake here made is not so much the founding of the romance upon an historical basis as the choking of the romance by too elaborate an historical setting the long accounts for example of nadirs campaigns have nothing to do with romance and are merely digressions perfectly justifiable and indeed necessary in a biography but out of place here the subject we admit lends itself to treatment as a novel or as a drama the rise of the turkman robber chief from obscure poverty to w ide empirewonderful though not unparalleled in the east the land of opportunities  the spoiling influence of success and the growth of arrogant ruthlessness under the sun of too favouring fortune the alienation of the affections of the people and finally the army by frequent acts of irresponsible injustice and barbarity culminating in the blinding of his son and the inevitable downward path pointed out by offended nemesis ending in the longforeseen assassinationhere are the makings of a tragedy sir mortimer durand has realised this clearly enough and has drawn the character of nadir with insight  but he is always taking our attention off the main subjectan interesting though not very unusual psychological studyto carry us away to campaigns and marches in places with outlandish names outlandish at least to the majority of readers which could have been sufficiently indicated by a few allusions without interrupting the development of the story the real romantic interest centres not in nadir but in the beautiful tender rajput girl whom he made his bride in india when he was crushing the mogul emperor here sir mortimer is fairly in the realm of romance for whatever truth there may be in nadirs marriage to an indian wife the story of her relations with the conqueror could never have been divulged but the introduction of sitara and her devotion gives the book its chief merit as a romance and also a real charm the indian girl is admirably drawndrawn with knowledge as well as sympathy the inevitable contralto to sitaras soprano the shirazi wife a particularly hateful characterrests on surer historical foundations for sir mortimer had traditions of her related to him by a persian minister who had them from one who had known her second husband residence in persia does not tend to exalted opinions of the people and we do not advise persians of either sex to apply to sir mortimer durand for j a character we cannot recommend the book to novelreaders pur sang they will find it tedious in spite of some charmingand some rather realisticharem scenes the landscape and the historic durbars and the military surroundings are well done yet all the time we feel ourselves not in persia of the eighteenth century but rather in the persia of nasiruddin shah and that is not the feeling the author designed,britain_contra

strange true stones of zoiiaia by george w cve kegan tiltia co all men except a few belated partisans of slavery will be sure to welcome this charming biok from the chronicler of old creole days the

even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed romance have been faithfully translated or preserved whore this firsthand eviience is unattainable the romancer in deposing the editor has nevertheless chosen some true tradition for the groundwork of his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie brouillard

roselius deserves his niche for his long duel in behalf of a most injured woman frankly what attracts us most in this and the succeeding stories is less the story itself than mr cables own combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables pencil at its best

colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own and his linen last

sum of twenty thousand pounds it illustrates how in the development of fictitious literature the character of the hero changes with that of the society which produces and admires him the hero of romance began his career well he was a head taller than his neighbours and had double teeth all round  for in the  struggle for life  he should always promise to be the  strongest struggler  to use the high scientific phraseology which a great novelist is just now making fashionable in the drawingrooms where it is necessary to discuss even novels in their relation to  protoplasm  and the  evolution hypothesis  the gianthero had it all his own way for a long time till some innovatorwayland smith perhapscame and invented for his special vexation all sorts of weapons and armour  cormorans  muscles then had to give way to jacks missiles and a few extra inches were found as deceptive as signs of any superior fitness for  surviving as the other endowment of extra grinders this  fitness  had now to be indicated by qualities of a more spiritual kind such as courage and cunning so our friend who had started in life as the jackdevouring giant now became little jack himself who by his wiles inveigles his stupid foe into becoming his own destroyer this went on till with advancing civilisation craft itself was found to be of not much account without what the lawyers call with fine emphasis  real property the heros peculiar fitness for surviving was now shown by his castles his lauds and the serfs who clothed them but society gradually became more complex and more knowing still and though wealth was recognised even more than ever as the indubitable sign of power it was found that castles and acres were not such indubitable signs of wealth as they had been for even acres may be seized and sucked dry by the devilfish foreclosureeven castles may and do succumb to the bumbailiff a far surer sign of heroic wealth therefore was found to be hard cash hence the first thing the novelist told the reader about his hero was the exact  sum tottle  at his bankers but even further mutations were in store for the hero and here again  evolution can explain them all  it is the great law of history says  drawingroom  science that the individual becomes more and more lost merged in society that in other words the role of the hero is in fact played out but the fictionist has thereby been merely driven to seek and find a higher and nobler hero still he is no longer the owner of the balance at the bankers he is the balance itself man the individualhis personality quite washed out of himis no longer fit for herohood instead of the strongest  struggler for life being as heretofore the hero of the novel the very principle of life itself in its most tangible embodimentthat is to say gold takes that place for though the scientific drawingrooms have decided that the physical basis of life is protoplasmprotoplasm is of course only the high philosophical word for money gold as the representative of all the good things upon which life must be continually drawing or dieis in the best sense the essence of all these good things and money has at last very properly come to be the allconquering hero of the storyteller as a lump of dough is thrown among the struggling bleaks in a river a certain sum of moneyten thousand pounds say representing ten thousand half ounces of lifeis thrown by the novelist among the human strugglers in the waters of his mimic world and he very properly takes far more care to interest us in the adventures of the bait which is being bobbed at than in the characters of the fish that bob this capital story of mr robinsons for instance might very well be called  the surprising adventures of twenty thousand pounds

characters of the story and the bobbings to avoid it by brian and mabel each of which is a strongly marked and living character and the adventures of the money its escapes and final triumphs make up three volumes of very amusing and often highly humorous reading though damaged evidently by being written for a magazine the story is well constructed but when a novelist has once a week to leave his hero or heroine confronted by some dire catastrophe it is hard to weave out of such materials a web that is not as fantastic as those nightmare tapestries that they say the  ogress dyspepsia  weaves for us after a lobster supper we remember being told long ago by a chubby kitchenmaid whom we discovered reading her bulwer at her sink that her idea of a really good story was that there should be a beautiful young gentleman in it and that he should be murdered suicided and married so as every think comes right in the end but when we asked this critic of a past generation how many times her hero ought to undergo these little experiences she laughed and said that once was enough for one11 now however thanks to the requirements of the weekly magazines the hero has to be  murdered suicided and married as part of his daily routine for unless lady mary upstairs or chubby mary at the sink puts down your story at some thrilling agonypoint why should they after the intervention of a busy week of balls and routs and dishwashings greatly care to take it up when they might just as easily and with more comfort to their souls be following in the same journal the triumphs of heroes more triumphant the afflictions of heroines more afflictedone of whom let us say is just doing his first murder hurling his ugly rival from the car of his own private balloon while another is doing his first suicide and is being just dived for perhaps by some heroic  johnson  from london bridge  while a third is just doing her third and last marriage and murder together exclaiming  thy blood be upon thine own head villain  as she leaves her seducer  weltering in his gore at the altars foot whom she has just pistolled with a beautifullyjewelled revolver no bigger than the lilyhand which held it the wise novelist bears these high requisites of his art well in mind and always contrives to keep a murder a marriage or a suicide running but here is the disadvantage of this latest development of narrative art when the artist comes to garner in his agonypoints in the accustomed three volumes his story is all agonypoints and a story consisting entirely of agonypoint3 makes a compound as indigestible even by the fine assimilative powers of mary herself as was the plum pudding all plums which little praying jacky  in the story prayed fora square foot of which he was only too willing at last to give to his wicked unpraying brother for a square inch of plain norfolk dumpling thus is the art of fiction progressing every day,britain_contra

pleasantly sketched is followed by a scene full of pathos the sudden death of mrs barton one of the ties which bound john barton to the gentle humanities of earth being thus loosened he became more obstinate in his aversion to the rich and his gloom and his sternness became habitual the authoress professes to have nothing to do with political economy or the theories of trade she says that she merely wishes to impress what the workman feels and thinks but she allows the discontented to murmur in prolonged strains without an attempt to chasten the heart or to correct the understanding barton rails at all capitalists as being so only through the toil of the poor this would be staunch communism there surely must be capitalists or the condition of the poor would be worse than ever we are told in scripture that the poor shall never cease out of the land but we are also told that their expectation shall not perish and that those who trust shall be fed and be delivered out of affliction further than this we are told that the person of the poor should no more be respected than that of the rich should be honoured and while it is sinful to oppress and a duty to assist so also to the poor that will not hear rebuke their poverty is their destruction while the father gets more and more involved in chartist plots mary engages herself as an apprentice to a milliner in a little street leading off ardwick green and where she is seen and admired by harry carson son of the opulent millowner the interest of the rivalry of the workingengineer and the young gentleman is however for a

two in captivity by vincent brown lane 3s 6d this is a strong and moving book it narrates the tragedy of two guilty lovers in search of ease how they would have fled from themselves but were withheld by fear of each other sheltering beneath sophism and stupefaction and excess until they could compass without physical pain their end stated thus the story may seem to be in need of justification but the justification is in the manner of presentation for mr brown is one that understands by a thousand little signs he ranges himself on the side of his wretched manytimespunished sinners and a novelist who does this is in a position to do more than relate events the two are lewis krehlartist sensualist egoist and hesitaterand kate lady bir his love the power to which they are captive is compact of sensualism moral anarchism pessimism guilt mr brown has taken an extreme case but it is full of strokes that tell home he has overstated but he knows trimmed of exaggeration this sad pitiful pair the product of an agnostic age are wofully real and credible and pitiful the book has faults there is throughout it a tendency to melodrama which might well be chastened lady bir is never fully realised by the reader and it is quite likely in real life that the law would have intervened and locked up the wanderers as lunatics but these are unimportant matters what is important is that mr brown has conceived a terrible moral tragedy and has developed it so bitingly that it dominates the mind we quote part of the scene following upon the death of lord bir to which though krehl did not actually cause it he was accessory lord bir lies dead at the foot of a long flight of stone steps krehl has sought out lady bir to tell her  no one can ever know  he exclaimed  kate oar hands are clean we shall be as one henceforth call the servants she murmured callthe servants she would not look at him in moments she seemed to grow old deformed  we must share the remembrance of this night kate on a sudden she slid towards the door but stopped and returning to the sofa reclined upon it in a fainting attitude krehl sat beside her he kissed her hands and her hair  all the future is ours kate but this will be with us always she muttered  no no he cried in emotional stress  you speak of slavery and we have done with that once for all the door stands open and love calls kate he said  i have made a discovery tonightthere is no such thing as conscience we must be natural and nature knows nothing of conscience it is one of the delusions that afflict humanity i could prove that to you and remorse remorsethat is another name for weakness his arms were about her  ahahwe shall be strong together i and they shivered in abject wretchedness she started up and ran across the room but she got no farther than the door there her face towards it she sank in a kneeling posture her head bowed low her hands on the floor krehl raised her tenderly led her back to the sofa  he was not fit to live kate  and now i must tell you the name he called youan adulterous rag   and he said  i meant to set her up as a gazingstook   her face assumed a shocking tranquillity she sat rigid and then the grimace of despair came to her features  now krehl said  i shall go to his room no one must know that i have been at bir tonight you will wait here till i return mr brown never loses this fast hold on his theme we commend to young writers the way in which he marshals his evidence and compels progression  two in captivity by vincent brown a subtle and searching analysis of the impress of guilt on two souls the story opens with unusual bluntness lord bir on an afternoon in june tried to kill his friend lewis krehl but it is not a sensational work  the interest is psychological lane 3s 6d  two in captivity by vincent brown 35 6d lane it is not mainly a question of literary style or capacity or material that distinguishes mr vincent brown from his fellow story tellers it is the revelation of the inner spirit of the writer his profound pity for humanity his own soul seems to rest on a definite faith and rule perhaps even an ascetic one but all his heart goes out to wandering sinners he is that very rare thing a healthy man who is connoisseur in the ills of mankind successes or not as stories all his books have a keen and delicate interest and next to 1 my brother   two in captivity is the most remarkable it is the history of two degenerates two lawbreakers who wander about the world without a compass seeking a higher life wearily and scorring the normal life for which they are not fit he faces all the possible degradations of their situationthe brandydrinking the loss of selfrespecting habits the hysterical substitutes for joy the petty hypocrisies before the world the abject melancholy fatigue yet he never shames the two he never cynically denies that they have ideals though unexpressed in the background you feel his conviction that their need is confessing simple obedience to common laws yet he does not deny in their tawdriness the reflection of some trailing clouds of glory and for their misery he has infinite pity besides the last degradation he does not put on them the two love each other to the unhappy end you will search far before you find so subtle so humanhearted a vindication of law as for the manner of the book mr brown uses modern circumstances not realistically but as if seen through an uneasy dream if maeterlinck were to write a novel it would bear strong resemblance one thinks to 1 two in captivity  two in captivity by vincent brown lane the abundant cleverness of this book is neutralised by the gruesome nature of its subject the bulk of the volume is a dialogue between two habitual drunkards described as gentle and refined persons whose minds have been unhinged by a tragedy the writers skill is shown in his choice of words and description of scene and background and is similar in kind to that which characterised two prior publications but we fear it is impossible to derive much pleasure from his latest volume,britain_contra

supplying this little reservoir with water without allowing its calmness to be affected by the swell without the sun shining down over the rocks which completely surrounded this little loch lit up its white and shining bed in a manner truly beautiful to behold while the depth of the water seemingly even greater than it was added a lovely tinge of blue beautifully contrasted with the vivid hues of the orangecoloured starfish which clinging to the rocks beneath dotted ait intervals the distant bottom in one or two plaices the wild and stunted shrubs grew down close to the waterline and thc shadows of a couple of young ash trees were seen playing on its sparkling surface the passage across was by a very slippery causeway not more than a foot broad at the widest and formed by thc edges of some ponderous fragments of the cliff which had faheu across the pool almost in its centre altogether it was one of the loveliest little spots that i think i ever beheld and thus suddenly brought

sterling treasures or wives they are securing to themselves the sketch of the village doctress is clever and like a sketch from life the haymakers supper and the songs are delightful the charm of the

a pair of blue eyes a rair of blue eyes by thomas hardy author of  far from the madding crowd london c kegan paul and co the appearance of mr hardys first threevolume novel in a popular form may be made the occasion for another word of criticism on it mr hardys work is of that solid kind which bears and deserves repeated reading and repeated criticism there are no novelists of our time not excepting even george eliot who put more  brains more intellectual effort into their novels in the last resort all novelists must be paid by the interest of their results and a novelist like any other conscientious labourer may work very hard and yet not succeed in producing an interesting result it is for the general public to judge whether or not works of art are to their taste success is the test of that cardinal merit but there is another meritthe merit of setting up a high standard of artistic perfection and labouring dili gently to reach it the merit of earnest devotion to the higher aims of an art which deserves independent recognition and this merit mr hardy may fairly claim his novels may be said to have a narrower scope a more confined horizon than george eliots because hitherto at least he does not seem to have concerned himself with those problems of the influence of race creed or pursuits upon character which engage so much of the attention of the authoress of  daniel deronda and  middlemarch both novelists are intensely occupied with character but while george eliot studies chiefly the influence upon human beings of their  environment as the philosophers call it and chooses the setting of circumstance to illustrate this mr hardys object is rather to illustrate the influence of one human being upon another the interaction of characters without much regard to how those characters came to be what they are then too there is a vast difference in their way of presenting character to their readers the one is analytic the other is dramaticor rather perhaps we should say narrative george eliot finding her bands full with the exhibition of her various problems evades the labour of bringing out the manifold aspects of a character one by one as they appear to the personages of the story she takes the reader at once into full confidence as to the nature of an individual as soon as she introduces him or her perhaps this is necessary to enable ns to follow her subsequent keen analysis of the influence of circumstances at any rate it is an economy of strength it saves the artist many anxious considerations of construction now so far as an ontside critic can judge these considerations form a large part of mr hardys labours as a novelist ihe labours to make his personages say and do things which mark their characters so unmistakably as not to need analytic comment to make them clear he leaves the discussion of their morality and the philosophic exposition of their motives to the personages themselves arid to his readers and critics his analysis is not served up raw it is incorporated with the story  a pair of blue eyes deals with very simple not to say hackneyed elementselements as old as human nature itself it is only a story of a charming young woman who falls in love with a young man promises to marry him remains faithful to her promise for some time while he seeks fortune abroad but contracts in spite of herself a still stronger passion for a man of greater force and weight of character after a struggle forsakes the old love for the new and pays a terrible penalty for her faithlessness elfride swancourt is the daughter of a country clergyman of an oldfashioned type their church is to be restoredi  awnd a young architect stephen smith is sent down to nelestow to make drawings his appearance is prepossessing mr swancourt takes to him greatly during the few days of his stay at the vicarage leaves hlim much alone with elfride and invites blin back naturally the young people fall in love but before stephen a youth of twenty obtains a promise from elfride he considers it his duty to tell herself arid her father that lie is the son of a mason in their own parish this at once changes the aspect of affairs she still loves him and will marry him at any sacrifice bat the father who had proved to stephen out of the landed gentry that lie was one of the fitzmaurice smiths and of a very old county family will imot hear of the match the two wise young persons lay their heads together and conclude that tile surest means of ensuring mutual constancy during the years of separation that must elapse before stephen makes lhis fortune is to mnarry before they separate elfride after much hesitation undertakes a journey with stephen for that purpose but at the last monient she hesitates turns and comes back without having the ceremony performed stephen goes to india and that is the end of act the first in act the second mr henry knight appears on the scene a barrister and essayist and the act is occupied with hiis gradual substitution in the affections of elfride in place of the image of the absent stephen it is not withsout a struggle that this substitntion is effected and mr hardy traces all the incidents of the struggle with the most patient and unerring art our readelrs will rememberthe skillwitli which george eliot analyses the changeful impulses that sway her gwendoline in daniel deronda now in one3 direction now in another mir hardys analysis is almost more elaborate and not less plausibly true to nature although lie never appears to be analysing but lets us see the various impulses at work and all the i time he never lifts the poetic nimbus from the head of his heroine not a word or an action of hers is out of tune with the keynote struck by the quotation on the titlepagea violet in the youth of prinmy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no prosepoet ever excelled mr hardy in justifying the ways of women we do not blame elfride although in the ordinary and safe language of everyday life she would be called a jilt we pity but do not blame being made to feel how inevitable it was that she should act as she did that in spite of her sense of duty the stronger man should supplant the weaker in her love we admit the danger of the principle as a rule of life we see mischief ahead in its applications but we do not blame elfride besides she suffers tragically for her want of truth when mir knighta somewhat impossible monster a man of thirtytwo who has never kissed a woman in his life except his own mother and has resolved that he will never marry unless he finds some girl who has never been in love beforediscovers that elfride has concealed her little episode with stephen which she did out of pure excess of love and fear lest she should lose her hero he roughly casts her off she marries another in careless despair but only to die a few months after her marriage mir hardy with proper respect for art does not obtrude physiological considerations but at various points in the story he records without insisting upon certain consumptive symptoms and we are left to infer that the excitement of her troubled experiences of love were too much for her fragile constitution every chapter in mir hardys novels proclaims him a masterly analyst of character who does not wield a scalpel but resembles rather those daring pathologists of the middle ages who saw by direct vision into the interior of the human mechanism he possesses the negative quality common to all the greatest masters in our literaturethe absence of cynicism there is not a trace of cynicism in his novels lie can draw cynical characters but his own outlook is from a different standpoint even the cynic he draws with the same unfailing sympathy and tenderhearted consideration with which he regards the rest of the personages that lie puts in motion on his wellappointed stage,britain_contra

in chimney corners merry tales of irish folklore by seumas macmanus illustrated by pamela colman smith harpers there is real genius in mr macmanuss manner of retelling the old tales even with the book in our hands we dont seem to read them rather to hear a voice from the chimneycorner hearty manytoned full of deep enjoyment and to see a smile with an irresistible twinkle in it  billy beg and the bull murroghoomore and beg 4jack and the king who was a gentleman perhaps these are our favourites but they have rivals these irish tales it must be remembered are of the merry order indeed have a good deal in common with our own popular nursery stories and with grimms they are for all ages and dull dogs must they be who do not chuckle over them as for miss colman smiths illustrations the cover is charming apart from that as in all the work of hers we have seen the colour is good she answers readily to irish inspiration but her drawing is far from satisfactory,britain_contra
  the girl at birreus by thomas heney ward lock  bowden  amongst the numerous characters introduced by our author in these pages there is not one which can excite the smallest sympathy or interest in the mind of the reader in his account of the occupations and of the desagriments of station life mr heney is at home and his sketches of shearing of woolsheds and of publichouse bars if they do not convey much information to a stranger still will recall many a reminiscence to those who have had experience of them ho evidently has travelled widely through the bush and graphically paints the hardships of passengers by coach but when he comes to deal with civilised society and to analyse the feelings and failings of women even of the girl at birreus he is hopelessly astray his plot is not promising the love of a squatting overseer for a publicans handsome daughter her illregulated uneducated mind and the morals learned in her fathers establishment do not form an attractive programme there is nothing new under even an antipodean sunthe end may easily be guessed,britain_contra
anne shencood or the social institutions of england our library table 3 vols bentleyit would be rash to say that novelists are not poets they are at all events artists of a most imaginative kind and their creations rise like aladdin palaces or nourmahal visions peopled with shapes and alive with sounds unknown in the denser world for example  anne sherwood abounds in the work of fancy yet it is professedly not a romantic book but a hard dry unidealized photograph from life and its heroine is a young lady whom  some ninety or a hundred professional gentlewomen have recognised as the typical embodiment of an english governess the daughter of a late clergyman if the author has undertaken to reveal a mystery however she has herself submitted to certain processes of literary culture and labours unmistakeably in the school of currer bell her anne is one of those not exactly beautiful persons who by their talents and overpowering manners make more conquests than are made by the lids of junos eyes or cytheraas breath her sister and she at the outset are left in lonely orphanhood all but destituteand we must say that in spite of their tedious pursuit of engagements they are both ultimately lucky and it were well if the majority of governesses enjoyed equal good fortune ellen the younger sister an exquisite tendril clinging to the philosophical fortitude of the less lovely anne suffers in the governesses purgatory but afterwards marries an excellent musicalvoiced pale man a curate and settles into felicity anne procures a superior situation and although exposed to the influence of vulgar manners and the jealous pride of an intolerable beauty plays her cards so well that she morries first the opulent col annesley and next the earl of ellaby in whose house she has been governess and who has divorced the proud woman from whom anne experienced her illtreatment both these gentlemen die when lord claude douglas formerly a dishonourable suitor reenters the scene becomes reconciled to the object of his affections and then goes away to die among the light cavalry in the balaclava charge all the people converse in an impossibly grandiose stylethe heroine displays on every occasion the imperturbability of a judgethe entire story is composed in altissimo if there be  neither fictitious scenes nor fictitious characters what would be a novel of a romantic character by the author of anne sherwood we cannot resign to the author the merit she attributes to herself but the reader forgetful of absurdities may be interested in a plot cleverly put together and a narrative in which all the passions play and a heroine not exactly pretty battles with a heartless world conquering it but losing her own heart in the enraement,britain_contra

new novels tap human chord bv aleernon black i wood macmillan  co tim power of sound to evoke or create to take visible form and to alter the shapes of existing things is a fascinating theme mr blackwood obtains from it the inspiration for a modern romance in which a clergyman of genius after demonstrating the power of sound to reduce a giant to the size of a midget loses his life in an attempt to pronounce the first syllable of the same of names in the clergymans fate is involved that of an old woman whose body he has accidentally injured by his occult experiments the hero and heroine are two young people who forsake him during the terrific phenomena which attend his last venture mr blackwood may be cordially congratulated on three of his charactersespecially the audacious uebermensch compact and intense his story captivates the reader his style often eloquent sinks occasionally to the prosaic  the human chord by algernon blackwood mac millan and co 6s the exploitation of the occult with any degree of plausibility in fiction is no easy matter and although mr algernon blackwood has succeeded in his previous books we are compelled to say that in this one he fails to convince the reader he might answer that it was not his object to convince that he merely intended to write a good story on somewhat novel lines but the essence of the employment of mystery and its only excuse is that it shall appeal to the mind as probable clever beyond a doubt is the human chordamazingly clever and the beginning of the book prepares us for a treat which unfortunately is not in store instead of being awed and impressed by the account of philip skale the exclergyman who discovers that sound is a force which can pervade matter alter its outward form call spirits from the ether and in short create a new world we are only persuaded of his madness we cannot dismiss the book however without a compliment to the author on his admirable use of the language he has a distinctive style that should bring him fame if only he will use it on plots which are within the bounds of common sense he has yet to find himself he has allowed his pursuit of the fantastic to carry him too far the psychological novel we believe will be his strong towerhis analysis of the thoughts of little robert spinrobin in the first chapter of this story could hardly be improved upon it is only when he permits his predilection for the unseen world to get out of control that he begins to weary us some very indiscriminate and florid praise has been offered to mr blackwood we trust that our advice tendered in the utmost sincerity and with a full recognition of his gifts as a clever artist will give him pause before he adventures farther into the exposition of subjects which only a matured and masterly hand can treat adequately,britain_contra

rgzscuzanuovs sketches of english character by mrs gore in 2 vols london bentley 1846 what could have induced mrs gore to  use up  in this form the matrials for halfadozen novels has she like bllwer abjured fiction  or does she desire to exhibit the inexhaustible fertility of the invention that could permit of the dismissal of a score or so of characters in the shape of brief and rapid but graphic sketches or is there in this a deeper design  is it that she or her publisher has ascertained that there exists a numerous reading public to whom novels are prohibited by preacher teacher mamma or papawho dares not indulge in their perusal save by stealth at early mornings before the family is stirring or with shaded candle in the bedchamber when others are sleeping is it calculatel that the substance of a novel without the name might be acceptable to this great class and that sketches of english life might be placed upon tables from which an avowed fiction would be indignantly banished such might be a legitimate speculation with such views the publication before us may be a prudent matter of business but for the general readerfor the attraction of the authoresss usual

in their yachts to the dardanelles as formerly to the solent while every classicbitten young gentleman of fortune who has sapped his way to an honour at cambridge thinks himself called upon not only to go byronizing to thermopyhe but to have a finger in the pie of athenian politics as if modern greece could not furnish schemers and intrigants of its own without aid from the prating and scribbling

little military hothouse once famed for the coolness of its nights as well as for the sultriness of its days witnesses every autumn the disembarkation of hundreds of fashionable travellers on their

for their exploits at smvrna who wants to know the colour of the sultanas bathingdresses at buyukdere and why cannot they content themselves with the nileetl raerea nihil without cramming us with crocodiles for the remainder of their days  it is much to the credit of noah that the account of his voyage was condensed into a couple of verses  and if the fashionable tourists who monster their nothings to our dismay at the london dinnertables or who delight the critics of the quarterly by  little ladylike books of travels were equally considerate with the cruising patriarch the world would have cause to be thankful   scarcely a city clerk of the present day but has gone through the two last cantos of 1 childe harold line by line and mile by mile plucking lilies on the drachenfels and listening by moonlight to the owls in caesars palace or the coliseuln and not a coterie at pentonville but endures over its greentea and muffins the same tortures which are in flicted in arlingtonstreet by sir henry or lord francis over his venison and hock   but surely those who are thus enabled to come like shadows and so depart and vice vend ought to assimilate their memories with their movements so long as it required half a life to reach the red sea a man might be pardoned for spending the other half in remembering and making others remember the journey but the red sea is now as familiar as chelsea reach and the impostor who presumes to set up as a conversation man on the strength of it deserves to be laid in it for his pains the most travelled of travelled men should make

the seeker by harry leon wilson heinemann tnis is a clever rather preposterous american novel full of sophisticated colloquialism exaggeration and a kind of slangy preciosity which is likely to prove vastly irritating to readers who are fastidious over their english certainly for a clever novel it is singularly devoid of the saving grace of restraint but it will interest and amuse readers of a certain type without doubt if only by reason of the very features in it that will offend more sensitive tastes candour enthusiasm and a reckless picturesqueness are qualities which it has in abundance and a severe editor might have made it a very respectable novel of the lifestory type a liberal pruning of its religious discussions would have been advisable but it holds humour of a recognised and irreverent american type  irovci lrotes the seeker i3 iilrrv 1m  wiu 6 ileilnemann a novel that is written with enthusia m and compounded of uch potent ingredients a love and religion can scarcely fil to be intere ting and interesting the seeker  certainly i it hals it dull moment book one the age of fiable give us almot too much of the boyhood of bernal and allanit is ingeniously alive with little details that erve as illuminating side ights on the characters of both but fewer of the ame would have anwered the purpose more effectively  ne is lerhals a little tired of seeing the reall good honet boy grow up to be the atheist while the more cunning le incere one remains apparently true to his faith for it doent actually happen that way always the story i zmetine looe and rambling is sometimes crude alie in thought and in treatment on the other hand it is sometime irritatingly timulating and thi wvith its obvious sincerity and the innate strength of it plot makes one icad to the end and own withal that the hook is worth readint,britain_contra

three weeks by elinor glyn duckworth 6s paul verdayne was of noble station and he fell in love with a mere parsons daughter who had red hands so his father gives him plenty of money and advises him to travel for his health and paul goes to lucerne there in the restaurant of his hotel he meets a wondrous creature with gliding feline movements infinitely sinuous and attractive we suppose that if she had been finitely sinuous she would not have been so attractive and then paul would not straightway have forgotten the middleclass lady with red hands for the sinuous one is also of noble station we must admit that elinor glyn takes us into the highest society her scorn of the middle classes and their morals is only equalled by her respect for those whom she would probably describe as the  upper ten we think that some one should publish some statistics of the divorce court for the benefit of people like elinor glyn lt would  sadden her we know but she would assuredly find that most of the men and women figuring there were not noble but middle class and even lower middle class in station your cheesemongers wife may have as quick an eye for a handsome stranger as any one else though she would probably not purr like a tiger or undulate like a snake or lie full length on purple cushions when she received visitors or make the air of her room thick with incense and the perfume of tuberoses unless she had deserted the cheesemonger and taken to the oldest profession in the world when such ways would well become her the truth is that the sudden passion of two strangers for each other and their abandonment to it takes more genius in the telling than elinor glyn possesses and a different point of view she is too desperately anxious to shock her middleclass readers and impress them with the upholstery of her highborn heroine the result is that you laugh a little and yawn a little and are not shocked at all but only rather bored by a vulgar and extremely silly story,britain_contra

mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and his only child to explain their views and positions  papa

delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy

made president of the united ates in ordinary times if i could be the means of educating their darkened minds and consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing

from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his

of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort

ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and

conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in

new novels the tory lover by sarah  rne jewett smith elder  co the authors real hero is that renegade scotsman john paul or paul jones but one can understand a good deal of sentiment in his favour from an american author here he appears as a gallant lover and perfect cavalier though his rough methods at sea are not ignored perhaps the story would have gained interest had joness really valiant fight with the serapis been included in its scope his raid with the ranger strikes one as rather impudent than heroic though he did get lady stirlings silver spoons and frighten the fishermen at whitehaven the tory lover the nominal hero is not wholly satisfactory he sails with jones against his inclinations in order to win the fair patriot mary hamilton and the best part of the book deals with his life at sea and the false position of a gentleman and a loyalist in such a galley it must be acknowledged that the lady is a prize worth winning miss jowett has a happy gift of description and the old colonial families she introduces with their neighbours and quaint dependents are aptly depicted  the tory lover bv sarah orne tewett 6s smith elder the most substantial and what matters more to the general public the most readable historical novels are now made in america within the last vear or two miss johnstone mr winston churchill and mr chambers have won real success in this field and now the wellknown writer miss orne jewett bids fair to rival them her tale is of the american war of independence and when we say that one of the principal personages that figure in it is the renowned paul jones expectations of romance will run high nor will they be disappointed yet frankly we miss something of the fire and dash of the capitaine paul of dumas tale and in mr churchills conception of him there was more subtlety miss jewett however inspires great vmpathy in miary hanilton the herolni of the tory loverl trprodued by kindperauissian of xtisrs smith elder and lo us for her particular privateer she exhibits him a  harassed man also as an unlucky lover rather than in his hour of victory but by emphasising hi magnanimity and hi generous public spirit she keeps him fast in his romantic place indeed his little outbursts of temper which she reveals are almost needed to make him seem real enough to hold his own on the quarterdeck but he is not the hero of the book miss jewett has risked failure by making wallingford sit on the fence at the beginning of the struggle and only go over definitely to one side at the prayer of the lovely mlarn hamilton and for his mothers safety it is difficult to take a keen interest in anyone so halfhearted but when we see him fulfil the pledges loyally he has taken against his will watched him the faithful lieutenant of paul jones and suffering under wrongful suspicion after the attack on whitehaven he rises into a wcrthy hero for the excellent story and yet we grudge him to the charming mary and wax melancholy over the disappointment of the gallant privateer,britain_contra

tales of a traveller a literary notices by geoffrey crayon gent on the appearance of bracebridge hall we were led intoa tome what formal expression of our sense of the merits and defects of mr irving

so large a portion of fashionable favour in conformity willi what we then observed we learn that the appearance of these tales has been anxiously looked for in the wellbrea circles to whom after all that is ever the most welcome which sails smoothly on the current of their predominant associations without startling them by any fatiguing originality of thought or offending them wit the inttusiou of a sentiment which can disturb the selfcoinplacency wbioh is their elysium in the article to which we allude we not only endeavoured to show that mr washington irving was essentially a writer of this class but that the curiosity is enhanced anti the approbation more pointed in consequence of so complete a conversion to the tone of the best company of an american republicanif in sinking the sentiment mr i has not also given up the name composition from an angloamerican exhibiting no small portion of the grace and aineuky of the addisonian school in point of expression and that without

bracebridge hall they j are related as if told at the hunting dinner of a gentlemanly although foxhunting bachelor of a baronet by the different guests and are  rather incidents or isolated adventures than tales bearing out our general observation that the leading faculty of mr irving is a light and pleasant power of combining reminiscences for of positive inven  tion there is scarcely an iota indeed cur author exhibits a little j consciousness on this score for in his address to the reader he  calls very apprehensively for indulgence therefore although several j of these tales are pleasant in themselves there is scarcely one of them which is not traceable in its elements if not in its concoc  tion the adventure of my uncle for instance is in character and locality a loan from the introduction to quentin durward  the german student is an avowed piece of borrowing and if we recollect aright the only thing not borrowed is a sneer at german mysticism and the destructive fervour of mind and fluctuation of principle prevalent at the era of the french revolution from the tale entitled the mysterious picture in this collection we expected something forcible in the development but it exceedingly disappoints and to say the truth mr irving is not a man to deal with the whirlwind of passionthose tempests of mind which strip human nature of its surface and discover the primary anatomy of the soul to say nothing of length and importance of mrs ratcliffe who did all that a woman can do in this department mn irving must not pretend to bear up the train by far the best piece in this commencing portion of the storytelling is  the bold dragoon related in the person of an irish captain of cavalry it is airy and pleasant in the extreme although from an author not so entirely on the right sideawe might suspect the purity of its morality tm materiel of the next division which is entitled  buckthome and his wends is collected sans peur et sans reproche from the essays and citizen of the world of oliver goldsmith the  literary dinner borrowing additionally from the similar dinner described by smollett in humphry clinker as given by himself to his corps of reviewers it is pleasant in reference to a conversing and a curving partner in the persons of the bookselling firm who give this dinner but we can only say that if the lofty mr murray has told mr irving that he arranges bis guests above and below the salt in the form of a russian noblemans table at which the visitors at the lower end drink inferior wine while those at the head swallow claret he has satirised himself more than his said guests and his laureate and crispinusses more than his  poor devils the oftentold story of a vain young man of common powers coming to london with a manuscript in his pocket which is to make his fortune sinking finally into a hackney writer of all work is anything but new and possibly nothing can less resemble the origin of the existing class of inferior yet necessary retainers of the press than mr irvings tale of  the poor devil author a sketch by the way which does the heart of the author no very extraordinary honour was it even favourable to his head in point of fact the general verisimilitude of all this has gone by and for a very mercantile reasonthere is a more general demand in the market the history of buckthome a supposed mercenary of a higher class is in his character of a dependant on the press a perfect nullity and as to all the rest of him it is hammered out of the adventures of the strolling player in goldsmith there is some pleasantry and now and then a lively and ingenious turn in the narrative but in other respects it is trite shadowy and factitious from beginning to end lite third part takes us to an italian hm at terractna the entire

explanatory giltedged note to the father of the city forthwith the omission may be serious would however that the foregoing was the only defect in tiie banditti tales but without requiring political observations out of place we cannot help feeling some disgust at a writer who in describing sudh a state of society as these stories treat of is never led into a single generous remark upon the grossness of the tyranny and oppression which can reduce an energetic and capable people into a mental and social bondage so gloomily and inexorably destructive not a wordhowever of this nature is

richard escott by edward a cooper macmillan  richard escott  is so great an advance on the writers geoffrey hamilton that one is tempted to revise ones opinion of the earlier story and find more promise in it than to some critics at least it seemed to contain this is a book ably written coherent and very far from commonplace now and again the tone so noticeable in the earlier one of weak social and philosophical reflection and the inexpressively lofty respect for what the writer regards as good form crop up but rarely it is mainly a study of as barefaced and contemptible a villain as ever defiled the earth a cardsharper a rou6 faithless to his parents his children his friends there is about escott some remnants of decent manners a faint reflection of the good tone beloved of mr cooper but nothing better that alford who knew the story of his wickedness and was a witness of his attempt to sell his young daughter to one of the blackest of unhung scoundrels should have grown to love him we are inclined to wonder at there are some things unwholesome for even christians to love mr cooper tells the story of escotts life to show the depth of misery a dissipated dishonourable man can fall to he has only partly succeeded to have altogether succeeded he should have endowed escott with some streak of real nobility but then the remorse and suffering would not have been good to look at and mr cooper has spared us horrors in escotts son george a fine young fellow but somewhat rigid the writer has further proved his capacity for dealing with human nature  let us not he says  in our ready sympathy with the publican be too quick to condemn the pharisee there are nowords in the bible story to suggest that he did not fast twice a week and give tithes of all he possessed and most of us find it harder to pay week by week and year by year our tithes of mint and anise and cummin than to neglect it and cry peccavi afterwards alford the mildmannered socialist is something of a failure though the way in which his weddingtour bored him will be a link between him and a good many readers no doubt mr cooper is intolerant of love stories and the pretty heroine whose troubles we have taken the deepest interest in he owns at the end to be a stupid young person and very little companionable the writers sympathy with sensitive children is again evident here,britain_contra
fiction et the roof fall iii by frank danby hutchinson i 6s we seem to remember that some time ago frank danby gave vent to her determination that she would never publish another novel fortunately like all ladies no sooner did she vow she would never do so than she at once sat down and began writing this extraordinarily fine piece of work what she has accomplished in it has not been merely making the book so interesting that once taken up it is impossible to leave it till finishedthat any firstclass journalist could readily have done what she has done is to give us food both for fruitful and useful thought rare qualities in a writerand to arouse and engage some of our finest emotionswhich implies the rarest qualities in particular there is a sense of pathos and of tragedy running throughout thi6 tale that again and again leaves even the male readers eyes in a moist condition to which he is often loath to confess it is a wonderful gift and quite a natural one it does not hit one in the eye like those effects we all know of brent harte which became after his earlier years the simplest imitable mechanism leaving a man not so much moved even as if he had taken too much english mustard with his beef since tolstoys resurrection no such good work has appeared in fiction there are pictures of a certain noinde which is not easy to describe semibohemian wholly wealthy hanging on to the fringe of the best company having shoots sprouting in the uppermost and possibly lowermost strata which is described by frank danby with a spirit and at the same time a contempt that are delightful both to brain and feeling it is brilliant to a degree we have both wit and humour presented for our enjoyment with a lavish hand let us enjoy them and thank whatever gods there be that there are such gifted beings amongst us at the same time it is just possible that people who recognise themselves or more likely are recognised under the guise of mr oscar paton mrs maltravers mr nat simons mr and mrs fred haxted and the rest may not feel quite as pleased however that may be there can be no question that  let the roof fall in  is grand work from every point of view it contains the most vivid descriptions of siam and the siamese mwwrs that we have yet read which is saying a great deal when we remember what admirable fiction has been written by mrs chan toon on that portion of the far east in fact frank danbys descriptive power is perfectly astonishing long ago did she recognise the important truth in lessings  laocoon that a description intended to convey any definite impression must be brief and contain only the indispensable essentials so with equal ease she describes steeplechasing or profound emotions society in siam such as it is or an elaborate dinnerparty in london the soul of an irishwoman or the inner workings of the jewish mind and here let it be said that our authoress has created no more lovable character than that of mossy leon we recognise we thinkwith such modifications and variations as she has thought fit to introduce into that character necessary in a work of art most oftenthe original and we think the original had he been now alive instead of being cut off prematurely would have laughed his most genial of laughs when he read frank danbys portraiture so far as it applied to him the love of brains apart from any other quality moral or immoral which is surely characteristic of the mysterious hebrew people is most typically exemplified in this figure there is indeed an extraordinary love not only of intellect and genuine emotion but also of humanity wherever it may be in siam or in ireland in the lowest and in the highest classes revealed in this most admirable book amid the ghastly provincialities and suburbanalitiesto coin a phrase if it may be allowedthat make a great part of english fiction unreadable at the present time except to suburban and provincial c0uls frank danby and mr frank harris are among the few to whom prejudice as such represents a horror and a hindrance to the development of our national art we need say nothing in this connexion about its being an absolute drag on our national life but is it not an amazing fact that whilst french novels however stupid from our point of view are read in the original or in translations in every part of the civilised world nobody except in america dreams of reading either in the original or in translation our english novels of the present day with very few exceptions why is this obviously because we do not appeal to humanity at large but why should we not when our writers have tried conclusions with any other writers in the whole wide world they have not simply equalled but surpassed them is the fault with the public or the writers let that most vital question of our national life be settled as it may authors like those we have already mentioned have long ago earned the gratitude of this country so far as there is an

resentment is turned to vindictiveness insomuch that his aunt the dowager rather than behold so heartless a usurper in enjoyment of the castle which she has been at pains to restore at her own cost for her dead sons benefit prefers to follow the course of action shadowed forth in the title of the book with minute psychological analysis mrs frankau describes the continued failure of the illassorted pair to realise that each is madly in love with the other and the occasion thereby offered to a coquettish society widow to make the imaginary gulf actual though the two central characters are so persistently vivisected as to approach lifelessness there is a fascinating host of subsidiary persons sketched with the authors wonted deftness and humour tempered by an appetising

chinese novels translated from the originals to which are added pro  verbs and moral maxiws collected from their classical books and other sources the ivhofc prefaced by observations on the language and lite j rature of china rfo by john francis davis frs 8vo pp 250 london 1822 until the embassy of lord macartney to china an imperfect translation of a novel was the only specimen of chinese literature for which we had to thank our countrymen and we were in the utmost ignorance respecting a people with whom our commercial dealings were immense that embassy howml  ever cleared away much of the obscu mi rity which involved the subject not merely through the personal observations of those who composed it but also by its more remote tendency to awaken a general curiosityandadesireto know something concerning so singular a people since that time chinese literature has received considerable attention the penal code of china has been translated other illustrations of chinese manners and chinese literature have been made known to us by the labours of sir george staunton and dr morrison and now mr davis by his translation of a few chinese novels and proverbs has enabled us to become still better acquainted with the subject these novels are prefaced by a brief but interesting notice of the language and literature of china  the chinese says mr davis value themselves not a little on the mere antiquity of their literature and are disposed to look down with great contempt on the learning of all other nations they have some books such as the yeking which are not now intelligible without a verbal comment to natives themselves if that may be applied to a nation which is told of an individual they may be compared to the man who wept in his old age because e could not comprehend the productions of his youth  but if we should be inclined lo laugh at them on this score they may still assume grounds of superiority over us ith as much right at least as he who proudly said to his audience  gentlemen i have forgotten more than you ever knew  a student of chinese should be somewhat acquainted with these books because there are frequent allusions to them in modern writings but to confine himself exclusively to them appears to be a downright loss of time there are many excellent works of a later date which may not only serve as better models of the style of the present day but likewise convey far more information with regard to the present state of the empire and the character of the people and as has been before observed multitudes of amusing dramas and novels from which may be selected much curious matter what we now want is a little practical know ledge of chinese literature instead of speculative dissertations on the nature ofthe language this volume contains three novels entitled  the shadow in the water c the twin sisters and the  three dedicated chambers they are all much too long for our insertion but we shall take the commencement of the second novel  the twin sisters which will afford a good specimen of the general style of these tales  early in the reign of an emperor of the ming dynasty there dwelt in a city of the province of hookwang a merchant named siaoukiang who had the misfortune to live on very indifferent terms with his wife they were for a long while without any family until after a lapse of many years two daughters twins were born to them it is a popular remark that sons generally resemble the father and daughters though motlier but these two sisters contrary to what is usum ally the case did not inherit the features of either of theil parents and they seemed like the children of some other family neither was the difference confined to their persons for their dispositions were quite as dissimilar as the father and mother wore extremely plain and very stupid so on the contrary the daughters were very handsome and particularly clever after ten years of age they began to resemble fair flowers glittering with dew or fragrant herbs agitated by the breeze  and their beauty every day increased until having reached the age of fourteen or fifteen no one could behold them without emotion not only were the young men in love with them but even those ofa more advanced age when they beheld  aaa confessed the power of their chara 4 their dispositions were extremely docile but notwithstanding this they lia i loamed but little and the xvhole extent of their knowledge xvas confined to figures as to though use of the needle and other female accomplishments they needed but little instruction in order to acquire them their dress and ornaments were from their station in life coarse and ordinary but vet when these txvo girls were compared xvith the daughters of more wealthy   their father beni a mcichautd and dignified persons it was allowed by all that they need not change their homely dress and metal ornaments for the silks and jewek of the others  as they were so very handsome and engaging it naturally followed that the young men of fortune and family should seek them  the good man and his dame were more like enemies than husband and wif the former wanted to marry his daughters without the interference ofthe latter and his wife on the other hand wished to obtain two scnsinlaw without the know ledge of her husband with this principle of mutual deceit they each of them secretly engaged with their sepaiate friends  though the father was severe in his own house he was naturally of a kind and friendly disposition  not like his wife whose turbulence led her when provoked to make the neighbourhood ring with her violence people therefore said to themselves that it would be an easier thing to dupe him than her aid that of the two it was better to aid the wife than the husband hence it was that the latter was more successful in her adherents than the former and after a little while for each of her daughters a husband was selected a fortunate day wtas chosen for the marriage and they the bridegrooms were desired to send the wedding presents  but with a view to prevent her husbands disapprobation and rejection of the match he was kept in ignorance of the whole  there were some sensible persons who said that the propriety of a daughters marriage ought to be determined by the father and that if the mother would not consent the matter should be referred to the magistrate who would neversule with an obstinate woman nor put add the husband for the sake of favouring the wife these persons wanted to get somebody to make their proposals to the former hut unfortunately all those whom they asked proved to be as ready to deceive him as they were afraid of his wife and when inmr  vited to act against her they immediately made some pretext for declining they dared not to incur her resentment saying that if they offended the husband they had nothing to do but tt wait irntd he broke out and then reason with him  and if he was violent they might still go and complain to the magistrate but if they offended his wife and her anger was excited it was not fit for them to contend with a woman  and should she abuse and even chastise them they must bear it and could do nothing in return  thus it was that no one would consent to assist those who wished to make proposals to the good man and they were accordingly obligt d to open the subject to him in person isle had been very much nettled at seeing people in the first inst ince go to his wife without coming t consult him and therefore on the present occasion when the marriage of his daughters was proposed to him he echoed ln consent vdth great satisfaction and made not the slightest obj dion  lio suitors told him that every one was afraid of his wife and tiiat for this reason none would act as mediators what therefore was to bo done isle replied  when the parties are unknoxvn to each other it is necessary to make use of snell agents  but when 1 have already given my consent what moro is required fi iie suitors hearing this were very glad and a lucky day xvas chosen on the spot for the transmission and reception ofthe marriage presents  the husbands plan was similar to his wifes inasmuch as ho would make no disclosure before bandi

istar of babylon by margaret horton potter harper  brothers i star is described as the archetype of womanhood made mortal as a punishment for having doubted the mercy of god she appears in babylon trailing visible clouds of glory after her is worshipped there as a goddess and only gradually becomes truly human under the influence of earthly love and suffering which teach her the great lesson of mans relation to god for the rest the story is to a large extent historical one of its chief incidents being the capture of babylon by cyrus in 538 bc and introduces us among other personages to belshazzar and the prophet daniel the latter of whom is shown in a most unflattering light it is almost superfluous to remark that a  fantasy  such as this requires to be very well done indeed or it is apt to become flat and unnatural mrs potters literary and imaginative powers are by no means inconsiderable but they are hardly equal to her subject and her book as a whole is rather forced and tedious there is a vague atmosphere of unreality about it all the characters are shadowy and dry and we are brought into no real sympathy with the life and spirit of the times it was we may add an illconsidered audacity on the authors part to give so travestied an account of belshazzars feast the biblical narrative is familiar and readers are bound to draw unfortunate comparisons,britain_contra

hie wei of life by robert herrick macmillan  co there is in this story a good deal of vitality and human nature the life is the life of chicago and the writing is frequently more american than english proper but the author of 4 the web of life has observed and has something to show for it there is a good deal of realistic detail in his not very cheerful story and his people do not take very sanguine views of the world nor of their position in it the description of some waste land in the neighbourhood of chicago is given with a good deal of sombre force and there are other points of interest on the whole a lack of art and feeling for composition is visible throughout,britain_contra
a collection of short stories the garnet bracelet by alexander kuprin duckworth 7s net in his introduction to this volume of short stories mr lion phelps professor of english literature at yale university has seized the opportunity to inform caution and put right american opinion upon the whole subject of russian literature his manner in so doing is unfamiliar to english readers it makes us feel that while we read we are like alice dwindling away in height by the end of the first page we are much too young even to attend a university  by the end of the second and especially when that tiny little joke is popped into our baby mouths we are of a size to spell out maxims at a learned knee  a novel is not great simply because it is written in the russian language nor because its author has a name difficult to pronounce or a slavishno pun intendedadoration of russian novels is not tself an indication of critical intelligence or a pessimist is not necessarily a profound thinker nor is unclean ness in itself a sign of virility but surely mr phelps exaggerates the extreme innocence of american literary opinion  he must surely be mistaken in not realising that it has long cut down these modest flowers of thought with its little hatchet nevertheless even kuprin is described in terms that remind us of those infantile dogmatics about the cat and the mat and  run fox run    he soars and he sinks  he is holy and he is coarse  he is sublime and he is flat between this introduction and the preface contributed by the translator mr pasvolsky who ls at naive pains to inform us when kuprin is at his best and why he is at his best the author makes a difficult bow but happily the first story which gives the title to the book is wonderfully successful and so the bow is a triumphant one  the garnet bracelet  is a story of hopeless love it tells how a poor official fell in love with the beautiful princess vera nicolaeyna for seven years he wrote to her and then on her birthday he sent her the bracelet at this her husband and brother interfered they sought the man out and he after giving them to understand that he fully realised the impossibility of the situation promised them to disappear next day the princess read of his suicide she received from him a letter written just before he had shot himself expressing his happiness in having loved her and begging her to ask someone to play for her in his memory the largo appassionata from sonata 2 op 2 of beethoven from this oldfashioned plot oldfashioned like the poor bracelet with its illpolished stones its green stdrie in the middle with the five deep red ones surrounding there come rays of deep quivering light and all that they reveal is linked together just for one moment becomes part of the tragic lifestory of the strangely simple man for whom  to love was enough  may nothing transient or vain trouble your beautiful soul he writes but the life of the princess is composed of what is transient and vain  the society in which she lives is transient and vain  real love could have no part in it but being woman her secret dream is of a love that shall fill her whole life  it has come near her and now it is gone for ever the other stories in the book do not approach the first  horse thieves  and  the jewess  are we imagine written under the influence of tchehov the first which is an account of a little boys association with beggars and thieves and contains a hideous picture of mob violence has many a touch which puts us in mind of the great writer but only to marvel before kuprins heaviness at the delicacy and surety of the other in  the jewess again it is easy to see in what soil the idea has been nourished but a sorry weed has grown coarse straggling with no flower at all for all the authors urging until at the last he has propped it up with an old stick of allegory which never for an instant deceives us a word must be said about  an evening guest in a letter giving a hst of the works he considers his most successful the author places it first this is very interesting as showing the extraordinary difference between the russian consciousness and ours to us  the evening guest  is quite impossible  it is very nearly absurd in its ingenuousness one evening somebody knocks at th writers door it sets him wondering who is there who might be there and how unknown is the future he compares life at great length to a game of cards and then imagines that some madman should hit upon the idea of a lottery of life on an appointed day there would stand an enormous urn filled with cards one of which we must draw and then what is life except this drawing of lots out of an urn of fate  and so on until he falls to wondering whether he will be able to make certain sounds to which that other person on the other side of the door will respond until finally when we are almost inclined to call it childish he cries  every time that i think of the vastness complexity darkness and elemental accidentality of this general intertwining of lives my own life appears to me like a tiny speck of dust tossed in the fury of a tempest what more is to be said  k m,britain_contra

straw and another in a bundle nf leaves so completely that it seems as though a living wheatsheaf or a movable bush were moving along for even their heads are completely covered with the straw or the

in vain that is known beforehand quinn he then cries  answer or instantly a few young lads who had stayed behind for the purpose appear accompanied by girls dressed in white the youngest of whom presents another nosegay to the bridegroom are you for peace asks the man of straw yes they reply   but we want to drink the bridegrooms health we want to look at him  that is why we put the chain meanwhile a parley is carried on in a low voice the end of which is that the bridegroom agrees to pay them forty or tiftv francs to expend in drink laissez passer  is noir the cry and a sturdy lad rushes frantically out of the house brandishing a heavy club with which he breaks the chain in two good luck and a blessin be with you  they all cry we have knocked the devil on the head  fire you

changed their tumbled and dusty clothes the dance of death and resurrection begins lt is executed as follows a tree is planted at one side of a danciiigtloor in the open air and upon it is fixed a burning candle in a lantern the size of which is determined by the will of the groomsman or by the state of the weather in the centre of the dancingfloor stands a table with a few chairs upon it for the musicians all the young men and girls who have taken part in the festivity assemble round the tree where the newly married pair also stand the music strikes up at a signal from the groomsman who dances with the bride they are followed by the bridegroom with the bridesmaid and then by all the other couples in succession the walt tune proper to this occasion is plaintive languishing and quaint at every third turn the dancers change partners that is the man stops leaves his partner and otters his arm to the next following girl while his partner passes on to the young man immediately preceding her only the bridegroom must on no account dance with his bride when her turn comes he makes her a bow and passes on to the nest nor may any one dance faster or slower than tue rest because usually various objects such as watches kerchiefs and the like are the prizes of the couples first in due succession this dance continues under the control of a strongfisted master of the ceremonies until the taper is burnt out the purpose of this dance is that the married couple should now for the last time dance with others the moment the taper goes out the leader cries  dead  the music ceases and the partners bow and curtsy to each other a gallopade strikes up and the bridegroom kisses his partner three times as often as they pass the tree the bride is treated in like manner by her partner after a certain time the tune suddenly changes the biidegrooin embraces bis partner and the bride is embraced by hers and both couples bid each other an eternal farewell and this is to be the last kiss that man or wife are ever to receive from strange lips the kissed pair that is to say the lucky youth who was dancing with the bride and the girl who was waltzing with the bridegroom when the taper went out are attended to their homes by the company and the music  and it frciucntly happens that they really become a pair by marriage in due time this is the dance of death to which i shall

  the tale of chloe possibly mr meredith would long ere this have coatrived to republish the tale of chloe had he thought very highly of its two companions that help to swell it into a volume the first story is a gem as perfect in its kind as anything he has written to read it is to feel at once aggrieved it was not ours long ago and delighted it has been kept back for our present enjoyment it is not easy to be grateful for the two others  the house on the beach  is dudl and improbable the case of general ople is rather funny but it is a hobbledeboy farce both are extreme instances of mr merediths habit in which only carlyle surpassed him of riding a joke to death tinmans wine that undermined the health of his guests is a wornout joke on its first appearance but it is served up again and again and again till the harmfulness of the wretched vintage actually tells on us who never once st at the rascals table so with lady campers lessons to general ople on the english language only grace prevents us adopting with vehement affection every one of the generals vulgarisms the extreme imurobability of the same ladys marvellous powers of draughtmanship is a minor sin but the improbability in the second story is vital a girl of intelligence and refinement will be ready to marry many kinds of villains but not a villain who is at once a patent fool and a pettifogger in rascality it is pleasanter to talk of chloe the first story begins in a tone of gentle satire with quaint reflections on amorous dukes in general and a particular description from his own lips of the early matri ithe tale of chloe the house on the beach the cam of general ople and lady camper by george meredith ward lock and bowden  mnonial delights of the elderly duke who married the milkmaid and who loving her to distraction has been persuaded to expose her to the perils of the wells that she may have the amusement she craves and the experience she lacks d a term approaches when the enthusiasm for serving as your wifes playfellow all day running round tables and flying along corridors before a knotted handkerchief is mightily relaxed yet the dread of a separation from her has kept me at these pastimes for a considerable period beyond my relish of them not that i acknowledge fatigue i have it seems a taste for reflection i am nov much disposed to read and meditate which cannot be done without repose i settle myself and i receive a worsted ball in my lace and i am expected to return it i comply and then you would say a nursery in arms the story never loses the tone of highbred comedy save when it takes you behind the scenes with chloe chloe who had given fortune and family and all for love and missed it she is one of mr merediths chosen ladies very loving muchenduring smiling for all her wounds gentle decorous distinguished the advent of the milkmaid duchess is almost simultaneous with the return of her faithless lover and hope for a little while mates with the love still warm in her breast but with the acuteness of sincerity she soon sees she is being duped and that the death of her own hope is not the only calamity in sight the duchess in all the selfishness of her youth and her newlyfound excitement is blind to danger will give up her duke and ruin herself recklessly so chloe chooses death in such a form that a ghastly sight may meet the eyes of the headstrong young woman at the moment when she proposes to make her rash elopement chloes plan does not fail the shock the stir the horror bring the duchess to her senses she goes back willingly to her duke sick of love in some cases where mr meredith has accepted a suggestion from history or traditionand we take for granted this is one of themfacts have proved stubborn things to deal with that a sad and desperate lady died as he says chloe died we accept as a fact but that chloe the gentle and the decorous chose the particularly ghastly end is not easy to be convinced of we slur the point as much as possible and indeed it is but a minor affair compared with the insuperable difficulty that fact thrust in his way in  diana of the crossways it was not very difficult perhaps to make a humorous personage out of beau beamish the autocrat of fashion at the wells but he is managed very delightfully and his story of how he met his own skeleton one night after a wine supper and how he was not discomforted at the sight is charming  i protest that by such a display of supreme goodbreeding he managed to convey the highest compliment ever received by man namely the assurance that after the withering away of this mortal garb i shall still be noted for urbanity and elegancy the milkmaid duchess too so healthy so vain so selfish so goodnatured and blunt is a triumph especially in the scene where she returns reckless and excited after losing her money at the tables oh im unhappy i am you must abstain from playing  its that ive lost my moneyi forgot and i shall have to confess it to my duke though he warned me old men hold their fingers upso  one finger and you never forget the sight of it never it is a round finger like the handle of a jug and wont point at you when theyre lecturing and the skins like an old coat on gaffers shoulders    im a wild girl again handsomer than when that  he is a dear kind good old nobleman with his funny old finger susan susan im no worse than others everybody plays here everybody superior the whole story delights and stimulates but the best it does is to give us chloe the gentle the generous the trust ing and the farseeing for a

memorable  crisis as it is called has made apparent many hidden transactions which at any other time would have caused a blush on the commercial face of the country but so overwhelming and undistinguished from number have been these exposures that poor commerce if she attempted to have blushed at all would have been feverred for ever our author in his preface makes the following remark  experience has at last been purchased at a very great loss and by it we now learn that both the formation of these companies and their failure have proceeded from one causeour ignorance of the country which was to be the field of the speculation but although this must be confessed yet let it also be remembered that the error was accompanied by atl the noble characteristics which distinguish our country we will not affirm that a few of these companies were not formed for the purposes and uses exhibited in their prospectuses among a many surely some must be honest but we candidly and firmly state our opinion when we observe that the majority of these stock associations c were invented for the sole purpose of keelping alive a spirit of speclation and peculation which was at once individually dishonest and nationally degrading unnatural value was attached to these baubles men became intoxicated with the prospect of immediate gain legitimate sources of wealth were neglected and an i universal mania seized like a pestilence the trading commonalities of this nation many sehemnes exceeded it absurdity even their i famous predecessors of a century ago and t highsounding nonsense

wvas proposed to him to take charge of an association the object of which was to work the gold and silver mines of the provinces of rio de la plata he accepted the offer and after a few days notice sailed from falmouth and eventually landed at buenos airs accompanied by two highlyrespectable captains of the cornish mines a french assayer who had been brought up by the celebrated vauquelin a surveyor and three miners i proceeded across the great plains of the pampas to the gold mines of san luis anrd from thence to the silver mines of uspallata which are beyond mendoza about a thousand miles from buenos aires  i then left my party at mendoza and from the mines i rode back again to buenos aires by myself performing the distance in eight days i there unexpectedly received letters which made it necessary for me to go immediately to chili and i accordingly again crossed the pampas and joining my party at mendoza we went over the andes to san  tiago and from thence without any delay we went together in different directions about twelve hundred miles to inspect gold and silver mines and on the night that i con eluded my report on the last mine we again set off to recross the cordillera and leaving my party in the plains i rode across the pampas to buenos aires and as soon as i arrived there i dismissed a proportion of r the miners and returned with the rest to  england 4 the sole object of my journeys was to  inspect certain mines we scent to the bottom of thein all and assisted by the indivi l duals who accompanied ine i made to the  best of my ability a circumstantial report on r each as the miners were remaining idle i and without employment at buenos aires it t was highlydesirable that i should go from c placeto place as rapidly as possible and for c upwards of six thousand miles i can truly t declare that i was riding against time f in these long and fatiguing journeysi captain head made many remarks which i are distinguished for excellent sense and i acute observation and throughout the work b there is perceivable a liveliness of spirit without which our author would not we so deem have been able to overcome those obstacles he afterwards so successfully spurnt ed we shall extract roughly and first r give the authors account of the state of religion in the countries he visited the religion which is professed throughout the provinces of rio de la plata is the roman catholic but it is very different in l different places during the reign of the spaniards the monks and priests lead every i where very great influence and the dimensions of the churches at buenos aires lucan i iendoza c show the power and riches l they possessed and the greedy ambition l which governed them it is a sad picture to see a number of small wretchedlooking huts surrounding a church whose haughty elevation is altogether inapplicable to the humility of the christian religion and one cannot help comparing it with the quiet village church of eugland whose exterior and interior tends rather to humble the feelings of the arrogant and proud while to the peasant it has the cheerful appearance of his own home when it is considered that the churches in south america were principally built for the conversion of the indians to the christa faith it is melancholy to think that the priests should have attempted by the pomp of their temples and by the mummery of candles and pictures and images to have done what by reason and kindness and humility would surely have been better performed but itheir secret object was to extort money and as it is always easier to attract a crowd of people by bad passions than by good they therefore made their temples as attractive as possible and men were called to see and to admire instead of to listen and to relents  the power of the priest and monks has changed very much since the revolution at buenos aires most of the convents have been suppressed and the general wish of almost all parties is to suppress the remainder oc casionally an old mendicant friar is seen dressed in grey sackcloth and covered with dirt but as he walks through the street looking on the ground his emaciated cheek and sunken eye show that his power is crush ed and his influence gone the churches have lost their plate the candles are yellow the pictures are bad and the images are dressed in coarse english cotton on great days the ladies of buenos aires dressed in their best clothes are seen going to church followed by a black child in yellow or green livery who carries in bis arms an english hearthrug always of the most brilliant w lours on which the lady kneels with the black child behind her but generaliy the churches are deserted cnd nobody is to be seen in them but a decrepit old woman or tvo vhisperingr into tile 11hink s of the confesxional box the sad conm1eqence of all thil j that at buenos aires thlere is very little rlcbqion at all at mendoza there are several ljewoile who wkih to 1tit dlown the priests  still however they have evidently cotosider able powver o once a year thle men and1 women are called upon to live for nine lays ih a sort of barrack which as a reat favour 1 was llowel to visit it is filled with little cells and the men anid women at diffierent times are literally shut up1 ill tlhese holes to fast and whilp themselves i asked sueveral peopi1e seriously whether this punishment was lwnidth perforined and they assured me thwart most of them whipped themselves till they brought blood one day ii was talking very earnestly to a person at mleloza at th1e hotel when a poorlookilln monk arrived with a little imagye surro anded w ith flowers  thi s imagte my friend was obliced to kiss an the monk then took it to every individluall in tile hotelto thle landlord lis servants adell ven to the black cook who all kissed it id fl tien of course paidl for the hlonour the cook gave the monik two eggs with the suprenacy of the spaniards it seems the infltuence of the priesthood lhas likewise vanished this is but natural  political tyranny is usually allied to intolerant bigotry anrd when they sunler the extinetioll of both is nigh at hrandl the method of travelling pursued by captain iead was aiventurous and hardy in riding across the pampas it is generally the custom to take an attendalt and yople often wait to acconmpany some carriage or else if they are in condition ride with the courier who gets to mnendloza in twelve or thirteen days in case travellers svisti to carry a bed and two smtill portnallnteaus they are lacedl pon oine horse nni hi ie either driven on before or by a halter tied to the postillions saddle tle most independent way of travrellingl is without bavgacre and without an attendnt in this case the traveller starts fromn butienos aires or tmendoza with a postillion who is clanged at every post lie has to i swiddle his own horses and to sleep at nplit upon the grounl on his saddle and as lie is rnable to carry anv irovsorns hie imust thiiow himself comipletely on the fee1ble resources of j the country and live onl little else thaii beef i a nl water i it is of course a biard life but it is so delihtfully independent and1 if one is in good riding condition so rapid a mode of travelling that i twice chose it and would always refer it but i recommend no one to attempt it lhss ie is itl irgod lieuti and conilition £ when i first crosscl the pampas i went wvith a carriarre and althionul i had been accistomed to riling all my life i could not at all ride wvith the peoris ind after glloppino five or six

completely restored me that for a week i could laily be upon imy horse before sunrise cotl1 ride till two or three hours after sunset and have really tired ten and twelve horses a lay this will ciilairi the immllelne distances whichi leoile in south america are said to ride which i am confident could only be done on beef and wvater9 we quite agree with the authors remark that a man must be  in good health and conlition whilst perfornwin a task like this and we colngratulate hlim on the gifts of llygeia which lhe appears to possess horsemanship among the gauchos or christian natives seemis to have arrived at its highest pitch of excellence and captain head for a europein formed no conterntible eqiestrian to ride nearly a thousand miles in little more ttan eciglt days is not an

11n v return i called at several of the huts to receive some gold dutist which i had prom ised to purchase of them it happened that i had nothing but a quantity of fourdollar gold pieces and althotuh thevy were current all ov7er south america i found to my very great astonishment that no one here would tako them in vain i assured them of thtir v tnlie blit these poor people accus  i i i tomed to change gold for silver all shock their fingers in my face and in differenlt voices exclaimed  no vale niada  gold is nodegti nothing and amongr such wild 1lnountajin the great moral truth of their assertioii rushed very forcibly into my mind i i offered them the piece of four iollars for what they only asked two and three dollars but they would not take it and we had hardly silver enough among us to remunerate our landlord for the board and lodging whijh he had afforded us one of the greatest enemies to horsemnan shill is thle biscacho of which the captain gives the subsequent account the biscacho is found all over the plains of the pampas like rabbits they live ill holes wbich are in groups in every direction and which make gallopping over these plains very dangerous the manner however in which the horses recover themselves when the ground over these subterranean galleries gives way is quite extraordinary in gallopping after the ostriches my horse has constantly broken in sometimes with a hind le and sometimes wvith a fore one le has even come down on his nose and yet recovered however the gauchos occasionally meet with very serious accidents i have often wonlere1 how the wvild horses could gallop about as they do in the dark but i really believe they avoid the holes by smelling them for ini riding across the country when it has been so dark th1at i positively could not see my horses ears i have constantly felt hin il his gallop start a foot or two to the riglht or left as if he had trod upon a scrpent which i conceive was to avoil one of these holes yet the horses do very often fall and certainly in the few months i was in the panpas i got more falls than i ever before had tlhough in the habit of riding all my life the gyauchos are occasionally killed by these biscachos and often break a limb atgain  these aninals are never to be seen in thte dav but as soon as the lower litnb of the sun reaches the horizons they are seen issuing from their holes in all directions which are scattered in groups like little villages all over the pampas the biscachos when full grown are nearly as large as badogers but thleir bleadl resemheles a rabbit excepting that thtey have very larre bushy whiskers in the evening they sit outside theirlholes an they all appear to be moralising they aie the most seriouslooking animals i ever saw and even the younc ones are greyheaded have mustachlios and look thouightful and grave in thle laytime their holes are always guardedl by two little owls who are never an instant away from their lost as one gallops by these owls they always stand looking at thie strangrer and then at each other moving their oldfashioned heads in a manner hljiclh is quite ridiculous until one rushes by them when fear gets the better of their dignified looks and they both run into the biscachos hole in a country thus perforated the danger is of course the greater we are in consequence more surprised at the excessive speed with which long journeys are performied the fear of man inherent in animals although of the most ferocious description is thus exenmthe fear which all wild animals in america have of mnan is very singularly seen in the pampas i often rode towards the ostriches and gamas crouching under the opposite side of mly horses neck but i always found that although they would allow any loose horse to approach them they even wshen young ran from me though little of my figure was visible and when one saw them all enjoying themselves in such full liberty it was at first not pleasing to observe that ones appearance was every where a signal to them that they should fly from their enemy yet it is by this fear that  man hath dominion over the beasts of the field and there is no animal in south america that does not acknowledge this instinctive feeling as a singular proof of the above and of the difference between the wild beasts of america and of the old world i will venture to relate a circuinstance which a man sincerely assured me had happened to hinm in south america  he was trying to shoot some wilds ducks and in order to approach them unperceived he put the corner of his poncho which is a sort of long narrow blanket over his head and crawling along the ground upon his hands and kness the poncho not only covered his body but trailed along the ground behind him as he was thus creeping by a large bush of reeds lhe heard a loud sudden noise between a bark and a roar hie felt something heavy strike his feet and instantly junmping up lie saw to his astonishment a large male lion actually standing on his poncho and perhaps the animal was equally astonished to find himself in the immediate presence of so athletica man the man told me he was unwilling to fire as his gun was loaded with very small shot and he therefore stood his ground and the lion stood on his poncho for many seconds at last he turned his head and walking very slowly away about ten yards he stopped and turned again the man still stood his ground upon which the lion tacitly acknowledged his supremacy and walked of the mules are another useful race the services of which our author in more than one instance experienced isle relates several occurrences of their obstinacy somewhat ludicrous in one of whichthe mule is excited by a draught of brandyand thrashed into speed by the application of a dead horses leg rather a novel weapon of castigation we shall close our present extracts with the following incident which occurred whilst our author was proceeding through one of thle worst passes of the celebrated great cordillera as soon as the leading mule came to the commencement of the pass he stopped eidently unwilling to proceed and of course all the rest stopped also he was the finest mule we had and on that account had twice as much to carry as any of the others his load had never been felieved and it consisted of four portman teaus two of which belonged to me and which contained not only at very heavy bag of dollars but also papers which were of such consequence that i could hardly have continued my journey without them the peons now redoubled their cries and leanirinover the sides of their mules and picking tip stones they threw them at the leading nmiule who nowv commenced his journey over the path with his nose to the ground literally nsmelling hiis ay he walked gently onl often changing the position of his feet if lhe found the ground would not bear until he came to tle bad part of the pass where he again stopped and i then certainly began to look with great anxiety at my portmanteaus but the peons agyain threw stones at him and he continued his path and reached me in safety several others followed at last a young mule carrying a portmanteau with two large sacks of provisions and many other things in passing the bad point struck his load against the rock wvhich knocked fis two hind legs over the precipice ard the loose stones immediately began to roll away from under them however his forelegs were still upon the narrow path hie had no room to lout his head there but hie placed his nose on the path on his left and appeared to hold on by his mouth  his perilous fate was soon decided by a loose mule who came and in walking along after him knocked his comrades nose off the path destroyed his balance and head over heels the poor creature instantly commenced a fall wvhich was really quite terrific wvith all his baggage firmly lashed to him lhe rolled down the steep slope until he came to the part which was perpendicular and then hle seemned to bound off and turning round in the air fell into the deep torrent onl hits back and upon his baggage and instantly disappeared i thought of course that hie was killed  but up hie rose lookingr wild and scared and immediately endeavoured to stem the torrent which was foaming about hini it was a noble efvort and for a momient lhe seenmed to succeed but the eddy suidenly caught the great load whrich was uponi his back and turned him completely over dowvn went his head with all the baggagre and as hle was carried down the stream all i saw were his hind quarters and his long thin wvet tail lashing the wvater as suddenly however up his head came arain but he was now nweak and went down the stream turned round and round by the eddy until passing the corner of the rock i lost sihlit of him i saw however the leons with their lassos in their hands run dow n the side of e theorrent for some little distance but they soon stopped and after looking towards the poor mule for some seconds their eariest attitude gradually relaxed and when they walked towards me i concluded that all was over i walked up to the peons and wvas just oingr to speak to them when i saw at a distance a solitary mule walking towards us we instantly perceived that he was the piaeton whose fall we had just witnessed and in a few moments lie came up to us to i join his comrades lhe was of course dripping wet his eye looked dull and his whole countenance was de jected however none of his bones were broken he was very little cut and the bulletin of his health was altogether incredible with that surprising anxiety with which the miules all lhave to join the troop or rather the leadiing mule which carries the bell he continued his course and actually walked over the pass without compulsion although certainly with great caution the precedigt quotation certainly borders on the marvellous but in courtesy we are bound to believe it in our next number we slhall resuine the examination of

extinguished fiction the excitement that used to be sought in the pages of romance is 11nw founds in the letters of  our own correspo ndents at the scene of the conflict dressed twith the art of relprters skilful to make a good tstory or in the unvarnished tales told by the soldiers in their homnely fashion so much more r grapllic and effictive than the elaborated prou lictions of professional writers usually at this season the press teems with new novels per1plexing reviewers by their abuudance and the patrons of the circulating library by the variety of temptation set before them all is changed now rhere is no longer labour for eritics or choice for readers two or three novels in a mof n0th are the utmnost that the most enterprising publisher will adventure and we fear that even these few do not always reward the daring that produces them in defiance of public indifference at such a season if there be a chance of success for any fiction it will be for a romance that is as romantic as possible the sober incidents of domestic life as it is however skilfully preisented are tame anl flat compared with the stirring tales told by every newspaper the novelist enters on the race of competition with narrators who tell of things more strange anid wild than imagination has invented miss willianis has therefore done wisely to plunge at once into the fanciful and the unreal to revel in romance and to invite her readers by incidents that will keep them awake even though fresh ifrom the perusal of the last own correspondents letter in the tunes the plot of the secret marriniqe is not one of those mere pegs for dialogue and description so often seen by the lisappointed reader of which after perusal of the first chapter the end might be predicted by any person familiar with modern fiction but it is an ingeniouslyconstructed story carefully designed and wost pleasantly told it it is improlable it is not niore so than many of our most famous fletions there is no extravagant demand upon that credulity which to some extent mnust be given by every readler of a fictiou to its author for even novels that n cst claim to be truthful contain sometling which if closely criticised would be founl not strictly in accordance with flact miss williams knows how far she can venture with isafety and she has not trespassed beyond that boundary she wins and rivets the attention by unexpected incidents without offending taste by making them too improbable besides this attraction of a good plot coniplex and full of surprises the secret marriaye is iwritten with very considerable smartness it is instinct with spirit it never drags it is never tedious the dialogues are smart and rapid the deescriptions are graphic although great pains have been taken with the composition there is no trace of labour the history is of clara lisle whose birth was mysterious and whose life is a series of adventures we recolumenl our readers who have leisure to bestow a part of it upon the perusal of the secret marriage we have cornplained on previous occasions o0 the author of  mary powell for that instead of trusting to her own genius she should have condescended to mere mimicry being capable of better things the endeavour to write a book in imitation of writings of an age long past is not new nor has it proved successful in other instances but in the present case there was no need for disguise tle authoress was perfectly competent to sustain a fiction avowedly her own as she has since provedl by tales in which she has thrown aside her self imposed fetters and revelled in her own freedom this is remarkably shown in errs larinda sinyuleheart in which turning aside from the path sihe has hitherto followed so pertinaciously she tells a story of home life in plain english and without any affectation of an extinct orthography or past forms of expression her new novel is exempt fromn these she tells her simple story sinply with exquisite grace in the style of the writing and a wholesome tone pervading the work it abounds too with the purest sentiments eloquently expressed it is but a single volume and we recommend it to all who have leisure it is an excellent family novel for even children may read it with profit as all will with pleasure the heiress of llanydon is by a very practised pen but one that possesses very unequal power the author who writes a great deal miust write many things badly even the good homer sometimes nods  says the latin poet and novelists are not exempt from this human weakness mrs marsh has written some of the best novels our time has seen lbnt it must he admitted also that some of her fictions are not worthy of her fame it may be that sie writes too much the imagination is not inexhaustible as authors are too apt to suppose if continually worked it is liable to reproduce its own images and conceptions rest is necessary to the full exercise of i that faculty its creative powers flag if too often invoked as may be seen in the works of every writer of fiction who counts his novels bv two figures it is manifest in scott cooper james dickens and a multitude of lesser men it is visible in mirs marsh who hias brought forth a new novel almost every year not steadily iniproving by practice as might have been anticipated but beginning with her best work the i two old mlens tales then after an interval flhing upon us again with emilia wlyndham  then flagging for awhile  then proving her capacity by the prerisions of lady elyn and then falling back once more into comparative dullness we cannot say of the i1eiress of himywlaon that it is one of her best but certainly it is not one of her worst it is not the production of her happiest mood it was not thrown off in a moment of inspiration but it was not written as a wearisome task against the inclination the impression it has muade upon us is that the authoress wrote it as a matter of business three volumes were required and she set herself to i make three volunies and sihe applied diligently to the work andl put forthi her artistic skill to i make a plot and to tell a story and here it is this process of professional authorship is however a very different thing front that genuine inspiration whiel iproduces great works in such cases the author does not write because there is some external requirement but by the force of an internal impulse trhe imagination flashes upon him without his will thoughts come thronging words rush to his lips he must give them vent he sets them down to relieve his full mindl and the result is a work of genius amrs marsh has a written this with such an impulse of inspiration but she has also written mechanically and the fiction before us partakes more of the artist than of the creator rlie composition is excellent there is also her wonted beauty of description even more than her usual pathos and much briliant writing but neither in plot nor in character is any creative power shown the former is commonplace  the latter has been introduced to us oftentimes before by herself and by others albert and imogene eugene and laura the two couples who are made happy in the end after the usual variety of crosses are like all other heroes and heroines edward aubrey is the good sensible man of the story but he wants individualitv the only personage distinctly drawn is lady faulconer the bad person of the plot whose scheming it is the business of the three volumes to trace and to defeat sihe is well painted but still she wants originality we have met her before introduced by mirs trollope mrs gore and by mrs alarsh herself we thus freely criticise this latest performance of one of our best living novelists because i we tiink so higily of her capacitics she can do better than this and it is disappointing to find her riot doing her best hasty writing is as bad as hasty marriage it is a mischief to a reputation that cannot readily be undone it ra script1 nmaet too many will be inclined to judge the author more by her failures thani by her successes mrs marsh errs however in common with most of her contemporaries she writes too much and too fast timnc is not given for thought before writing or correction afterwarls hence the tendency with all of then to reproduce themselves in ldot character an1 expression hence the filling off so frequently i seen in their subsequent works instead of thiat improvement which experience maturity of nind and practice ought to produce we are desirous of directing the serious attention of our novelists to this besetting sin of theirs and we avail ouriselve of the example of one of the cleverest among them because if this error can thms affect the power of so accomplished an authioress asi mrs marsh how dangerous must it be with 1 those of lesser genius but though the ileiress f 1unooglifon is not of her best and worthy of her highest reputation it is nevertheless a work of great ahility aolt will be read with

the seven wives of bluebeard and other mar vellous tales by anatole france a translation by d b stewart lane 7s 6d netthis pleasant and apparently accurate rendering gives us one of the most delightful works of an author who loses relatively little through the process of translation partly because of the doric simplicity of his style and partly because of thc importance which he attaches to the plot and the intellectual gist the four fairytales for rationalists which compose the volume show m france in two of his more familiar and lovable aspects as a sceptic in philosophy and as one who puts no confidence in any feminine pretensions to chastity the story of the incurably bashful m montrgoux and the seven women he married in succession each time with disastrous results is perhaps the classic example of m frances theory of sex the second story supplying a new version of the legend of the three small boys who were made into pork by the wicked innkeeper and rescued from the saltingtub by st nicholas is one of the brightest of m frances ecclesiastical satires the third recreating  the sleeping beauty also contains a satiric element the fourth is a comprehensive satire on thc existing social fabric m france has always been regarded in england as primarily a satirist but at the same time he is read less for what he says than for the way he says it and for the form and sensuous colouring of his work we are grateful to him for the homage he pays to his rather material aphrodite  the seven wives of bluebeard and other marvellous tales by anatole france translated by d b stewart 7s 6d net john lane here are four stories by anatole france resplendent with that great writers wit irony and philosophy and admirably translated the first story is concerned with the rehabilitation of bluebeard monsieur de montragoux  justly remarkable for having married seven wives so far from being the accomplished villain of romance bluebeard m france is assured in his belief  was good and unfortunate and his memory has been overwhelmed by unworthy slanders  the miracle of the great st nicholas the second story is in the true voltairean vein the  story of the duchess of cicogne and of monsieur de boulingrin who slept for a hundred years in company with the sleeping beauty is the shortest and least important of the four the satire is now directed against the sceptic the unbelieving secretary of state who refusing to believe in fairies maintains in face of overwhelming events that  nothing exists which is not according to nature the last and longest story  the shirt takes us once more on the old quest in search of happiness in vain the kings equerry and private secretary seek the happy man whose shirt alone can restore the king to health rich and poor statesmen and soldiersall have the canker of unhappiness in their hearts at times we seem to be on the right scent and then the fatal barrier is interposed and when at last the happy man is foundwell the conclusion must be learned from anatole france himself,britain_contra

curiosity miriam on her part regarded the indian female with involuntary admiration she had scarcely passed the season of youth and her mature and noble figure at once dignified and graceful possessed that vigour and elasticity so peculiar to the natives of the forest while her regular features her soft and intelligent countenance expressed a mind susceptible of elevated sentiments and a heart warmed by the gentlest affections of her sex cushnminaw cautiously drew a mat over the aperture through which they entered and advancing close to his adopted mother with very earnest gesticulation entered into conversation with her when they had finished speaking the wife of mononotto approached the captives and taking a hand of each in her own she saiddo not fear white daughters aiioma will

before the youth delmaine has time to get into mischief he meets with a college friend changed in a short space into a grave thoughtful person who tells him an eventful storyall how and about the ruin of his fortunes and his hopes by an unlucky acquaintance with the salons of paris and concludes by warning his friend against their seductions scarcely had delmaine been in paris twentyfour hours when lhe was insulted by a young french count notorious as a duellist and a meeting took place in which he had the good fortune to hit his skilful opponents and escape himself this event brought him at once into a sort of fashionable notice and he became an object of admiration and jealousy to men and women a marquis de forsac particularly seeks his acquaintancea regular roueand who upon learning the youths connexions immediately gets up a plot against him and prevails upon a young lady of distinguished attractions whom accidentally and knowing nothing of her character delmaine had a few days before rescued from some imminent peril the scheme of the marquis was to detach delmaine from miss stanley by involving him in the seductions of the salons and himself to lay siege to her in the hope of carrying her and her fortune the insidious marquis commences operations by persuading delmaine to break an engagement for the theatre with miss stanley and go to madame costellos on the assurance that the beautiful being to whom he had been of such essential service would be present and was actually longing to make her personal acknowledgments to him the lady in fact fascinates himhe spends

the contrivance of the marquis they are seen by miss stanley and her friends this with some expostulation on the part of his old college friend completes his alienation and he gives himself up to his new con nexions the liaison is of the most intimate and absorbing but not of the common sordid kind for the lady she is very youngis deeply attached and does all she can to detach him from play but the arts of the marquis baffle her and he pursues his career till his purse is exhausted which he replenishes by borrowing 20000 francs for six months at fifty per cent the money is obtained from a common usurer through the agency of the marquis who himself pockets at once onehalf of the premium this very accomplished scoundrel has now an infallible plan for breaking the ecartd bank and he urges delmaine to join him in the execution of his scheme but the significant glances of the lady check the rising inclination and he consents only to go and watch the effect of the new plan refusing at the same time to take any money with him he is however soon convinced of the success of the plan and now begins to wish that he had brought his purse with him the marquis contrives to engage him with a lady and to get himself deputed to go to delmaines apartments and fetch it and finding delmaines lovely mistress alone is tempted to avail himself of the opportunity urges his passion and finally is just resorting to force when delmaine who had his suspicions of the mar quis rushes ininflicts summary vengeance on the marquis and in despite of assurances and protestations renounces the lady

among english hedgerows by c johnson illustrated macmillan  comr johnson ia a native of the united states who armed with a camera warm sympathies and an excellent eye for the picturesque and the oldworld ways of the english came among us as the latest disciple of washington irving he visited a large proportion of our show places frequenting by choice wayside inns village lodgings farmhouses small and great schoolhouses ancient churches and nonconformist meetinghouses  he was present at fairs in kent at markets in lincoln and at rural weddings his observation is fresh and quick thus he was rather surprised to lind that we bury our dead without glass in the coffin lids his elaborate and animated de scription of the manner in which we play i game called cricket which he prefers to the transatlantic baseball is worth reading row ing and football escaped his notice and of swimming he says nothing the charms of english landscape of pastoral scenes of hill crowned wastes of moorland the chalk down of sussex and salisbury plain and treeclad slopes of somersetshire so affected him as to put lightness glow and life into his notes nor is he insensible to the vulgarisation of every lovely spot which alas  attends popularity thus looking downon windermere he writes the scene was a very peaceful one but not eo on the roads for every highway was full of coaches carriages of all sorts cycles aud pedestrians the region was overflowing with tourists and sightseer and almost every other person seemed to he carry ing a camerai had never seen a mountain tam the noouday sun was at its hottest whoa i sturted and i had to go more than two miles along a baked country road before i cnnie to ihe path that climbed the hills numbers of other tourists wen making the same pilgrimage but the heat and th increasing roughness of the route made the weak willed and the fleshy lag and many turned back although his experiences were wide especially among the rural classes with whom he made himself so much at home that a simple rustie complimented him upon the excellence of his 44 english his information did not reach far among the more educated classes the best of whom he says study policy and statecraft or science or interest themselves in the affairs of their tenants and home villages 44but he adds  the large majority after being sent to oxford or cambridge settle down to a life of indolence or pleasure their greatest accomplishment is very likely to ride well after the hounds and their fi nert boast is of the times they have come in first in the hunt the writing on the whole justifies the praises the author received for his speech but now and then there is a phrase odd to our ears thus a travelling loafer named starkey is said to he attended by a small yellow dog that was very dismal and scrawny  and at  aylesford in the county of kent 44 which is on a little tidal river called the medway he speaks of  a queer old bridge that humps itself over though stream in the middle of the village in his peregrinations he met as might be expected with many queer characters and his delineations of them could hardly be improved for humour and vigour of these wordpictures none is better than the wholelength portrait of mr taplow expoliceman and village sexton who officiated in the latter capacity until the parson dismissed him because of his unreasonable and unseasonable partiality for beer mr johnson lays a heavy hand upon the drinking ways of our rural population but he suggests no remedy for them and makes even more of the evil than the occasion quite justifies on though whole the english reader will be amused with the aloof neal and naivete of this wanderer among 44 english hedgerows  who writes as one might do who for the benefit of europe and the united states had travelled around lake baikal or even around lake tchad before the arrival of the french in that region the illustrations which are evidently due to the travellers camera are clear and well chosen,britain
  old english fairy tales collected by s baring gould illustrated by f d bedford methuen the advantage that mr baring goulds collection has over others of the kind is that he has newer that is older stories to tell we are sure that at least half this volume will be new to every reader today who is not a student of folklore the conclusion to be drawn is not that he has told the ones that were not good enough to survive in popular favour the stories here are enthralling besides having the delight of novelty about them they are of the good old brand only some wear their likeness with a difference and that difference is in many caes a greater poetical distinction which seems to belong to the essentials of the tales rather than to their treatment lhe editor has had his will with them joining several together and introducing the episodes of one into another that seemed to want filling up but if you want to know the extent of his interference you need only turn to his notes  southernwood the shepherd of salisbury plain  desideratus and  he crown of white roses may be confidently tried on children and the heart is old indeed that does not warm to them we like mr bedfords pictures,britain
days stolen for sport b llliilip geeii ixjs id et t1 werner laurie after the big success of his book with the terrible title w what i have seen while fishing and how i have caught my fish it is not at all surprising that mr geen has made another volume about his many angling days  what i have seen etc etc was characterised by much genial breeziness of style and it was easy to gather that mr geen ways a true angler his new book which has a title that is a big improvement on that of its predecessor is a production of similar spirit and is as frankly unconventional as the other mr geen is not a  literary man  and hie has wisely refrained from introducing the stockphrases that are a feature of the output of too many of our  literary men  who write books on fishing one gets the impression that mr geens talk will much resemble his writing and one follows with a kindly interest his domestic details and his spirited accounts of adventures with fish and fly it is a refreshing book andi has many passages like this a although i am old in yearsthreescore and seven1 can walk the longest day and shoot as straight as ever i could thanks not so much perhaps to the stiffening of my loins by birchings as to the reason for their infliction stealing days has ever been a joy to me and i often played truant from school i had no compunctions at the itme and have had no regrets as vet for what i have learned in the fields and woods has been a source of lifelong pleasure,britain

a page from the diary of mr william hewer by s r crockett my name is william hewer and i am clerk to mr samuel pepye of the navy office whom all the world knows we go much about together lie and i and since he writes all down in his cypher books i also have made it my business to read and learn therefore i have a book of mine own and do write in it only in another cypher which my good master hath not time to under stand being too busy with his music and fallalling after women folk for me i see no good in suchlike they eat a iiians substance only i am heartsorry for my dear mistressthat is my masters wife whom her husband calls poor wretch but i at her request sweet cozin though indeed i am no kin of the flesh to mistress pepysonly he whomn she calls her bachelor she doth choose the ribbons for myl kneebreeches of the right blue which she will have dark on account of my eyes being of that hue ah a sweet yomng lady and much to be pitied is my mistressas on my soul i do pity her for though i help my master faithfully in all that concerns his business at home and in the house i am lieged to ally mistressaye and think it no shame for a poor young womnanin must ieeds have someone to stand for her and so she shall so long as my name is hewer though i do repeat i do serve my master faithfully alsoyes and shall yet i own i can never understand her exceeding jealousy of him our master samntuel is well and well enough but there be others with as tight a leg as straight a back andbut there wherefore should one search for the reasons of women she loveth him not greatlyno not to the rubbing of one copper against another save that is when she is jealous of him then her tongue goes like a millhopper and her words fall wide and foolishly till i am ashamed of the imaids hearing as they do from garret to cellar which is all very strange for she hath often told me of her griefs and how that she has found out better things than to fix her love upon such a man who will follow the flutter of a servingmaids kirtle across half london now for me i had liefer bide at home with my toes to the fire and watch my dear mistress at her french broidery or which is yet pleasanter hear her read tie maids tragedy or that french play in which she tripped up mi johii divdei himself finding his last at the kings house to be copied from it almost line by line now anm i resolved to keepi a secret diary also which in the evenings when i stay at home with headache i may read to my lady and when it cannot be otherwise to her chambermaids also at least the plainer of them for the prettier are not to be trusted being apt to be of my masters faction this i do because i hold it a pity that a poor woman should hear nothing exact of what goes forward about the court and in the townonly chatter of mantuamakers and the singing women whomi master plepys brings about the house this solitude will i strive to make easier for her yet must i be careful of my ilntelligences to my mistress for oftentimes she will fall into wild talk and inore than once accusiing of her husband she came nighl to letting the cat out of the bagthat it was i who had spied him out in coaches and slinking about alehouses up this blind alley and down that yet i count it no wvroig faithfully to serve a man and also as faithfully his wife even a poor wretch  must have some coinfort and if she have it at home and in one to whom she can speak freely how much better than gadding abroad so as to become like many others the talk of the town besides tis in all innocency and i hold it fitting that a woman yotung and mighty pretty shall have at least the comfort of being able to speak her mind to a kindly listener hence she speaks to iae and i tell her all that has happenedalso much that i have only heard only the business of the office and of my master i do lnot speak for i would be a faithful friend to botha thing w hich i count difficult but not impossible so then this being the third day of june and mir samuel pepys gone to deptford upon his affairs i lay a page between the folios of the book of requests and begin jtune 3rdthis morning the king walked in the privy garden with the duke and there was very merry declaring that his brother s confessors did nominate his ladyloves to him for a penance they being so plain of their featuresalso old at this the duke tooajl offence and turning on his heel was gone in a huff to the navy office into which he entered like a whirlwind while his brother stood still leaning on his cane and laughing then the kling betook himself to mistress frances stewart with design to pay court to her but she would do nothing but pull cherries from the trees of the royal garden and eat them letting one hang from between her lips by the stalk and calling upon his majesty to declare if lie did not think it desirable then dld she climb a cherrytree with the kings help and being freakish would have him follow to a seat beside her among the branches but this his alajesty refused though smilingly and as one who had it not been for the courtiers would gladly have yielded then came the queen out and so there was an end of the frolic for though her majesty hath need of patience and practises it yet in portugal her country is no jesting wvith such things yet beeause the queen also is fond of mistress stewart and cherishes her for her beauty and simplicity though not boldly witty like our nelly of the kings house there was no anger only the queen did shake her finger at the king and bade him think of his latter end rather than to go climbing trees after scapegrace maids to which the king replied lord madam that was the very thing i was thinking of which all took very well and held to be of a mighty pretty wit it was indeed rare sport to see how little stewart could flout the king and yet keep him more on the edge of himself than castle maine davis gwyn or all the drove of themwithal giving him no satisfaction but only saucy answers and all wvith such a mockery of civility that perforce the king laughed himselfyet methought with a wryish face but afterwards my lord of richmond and the chancellor smiled at her and she at thein so that it was easy to be seen how the three were of a very good intel ligence but the king guessed nothing of it only continued to make eyes at pretty frances till they fairly bulged out of his sallow faceas saith the proverb like the 1101s on a gooseberry fool this mistress frances is used to behave like a child knowin that when she smiles none can find it in their hearts to scoldher face being the most ierfect that ester was seven so much so that the king hath caused his maker of m1eldals john iloettiers to take a medal punching of it in the profile but it is her childishness which wtins upon voui for it is illmpossille to be angry with her she moves quickly like a bird nervous uand light as if ready to dart off in any direction at auy moment though she wears short gowns and those of grey there is always a look about her as of a trolic bird with glossy plumage which ones hand desires to caress but on a sudden lo she escapes from under and is at the end of the corridor laughing and twitter ing and looking back like a thing that always perched upon twigs so at least says the duke and i believe him and so much for mistress frances this day we saw not much of his grace for instead of abiding in the navy office he merely walked a little to and fro stamping his foot and so returned back as he came for this all in the garden wvere heartily sorry for it only made little stewart the more mirthful so that she kneeled anid denianded of the duke of york his fatherly blessing meaning thereby that the story which the lord brunker had told was truenamely that lie was a jesuit still it is a pity to see great men so used in public and the king himself looking on and laughing this doth not make the country respected but the contrary for all the while the french ambassador wvas writing in his tablets and i doubt not all goes to lewis as fast as spur and sail can drive it but after all was done and the king and duke retired once more mistress frances laid aside her spritely manners to talk with the chancellor and my lord richmond very gravely there was none to overlook and mistress stewart did give a hand to each as though mnaking some promise and even the stiff old chancellor set his lips to that which he held while as for my lord richmond he kissed his finger by finger like an holy relic it was by virtue of her maid who is of the country of wales having come hither with miss price that we get us news of the court at first hand of course being my lord dukes servants iv hear much of which i do not speak but what little ann hughes doth prate i think it no shame to tell for if i do not my master will and it is a pleasure to forestall him besides hughes being of the welsh folk doth most merrily invent there is no fear in her being miss frances stewarts favourite woman yet do i believe that for honesty there is none in the court like mistress stewart except only miss jennings who is so for interest and m1iss hobart bv nature and inclination the queen is also well advised of this and tis said little frances doth carry all her sweethearting letters to her majesty to laugh overwhich for a child such as she appears to be is very well thought on juite 4thtoday came the welsh girl ann hughes to our house and my dear mistress made her welcome to such supper as there chanced to be in the house the three of us were scarcely seated before that she clapped her hands and began to entertain us with the very latest news of the courtthe hearing of which gave us much joy there have been mighty fine doings she said all because of the fair at southwark on the common betwixt the abbey and m1argarets hill for nothing would set my lady yestreen but that she must go thither with mistress wells the newcomer among the maids both of them in the garb of saucy pages these they caused us to borrowthat is betty xwho waits upon miss wells and knows all the idle pageknaves in st james found no difficulty but as for me i risked my service and refused to go because of nty modestyand having one knee in and the other out owing to a fall out of my mothers arms long ago in my country but knowing the dangers of the town better than my ladies i did covenant with one rowland glyn a pembroke man and one that is to be trusted to follow them with a wise lad or two of my people anid as things turned out it was just as well for my madcaps being let out on the causeway could at the first do nothing but laugh so that their cloaks wellnigh fell off it was only the clearer dusk of even and no time for such pranks when the theatres are letting so many rambling gallants abroad and the very pavements are far from securesave that is in the puritanic city even so there was a great todo the rude street lads cryers of pampphlets horseholders linkboys and the like made mock onie there was who blasphemed the name of the lord if ever he had seen a sight like that nay he did pretend to faint being a shy knave and summoned his comrades to hold him up sinking into their arms as one overcome by vast terror and amazement but rowland glyn and his mate called for  prentices and the lads of the apron swarmed out of the booths so that my ladiei were briefly rid of these rascals and after this they walked quite close behind mistresses stewart and wells behaving like serving men but still holding their cudgels ready so that few dared meddle with them understanding well that it would be at their peril but when they arrived at the fair there were so many booths to examine and so many fine gentlemen elbowing hither and thither that rowland could by no means keep so close so it chanced that some of these jostling the ladies without intent as i believe miss wells pulled out her little rapier that was no more than a toy anid ait the sight of the naked steel mistress stewart began to weep so there was a great trooping to the spot and as illluck would have it my lord of rochester who is always to be found where mischief is would have them both into his carriage but by great good fortune rowland perceived the duke of richmond who is greatly in love with mistress frances only hides it for fear of the kings anger and he bade him come quickly for that there was a young brother of mistress stewarts just arrived from scotland and in sore need of assistance so richmond with george hamilton and the frenchman grammunt called the chevalier did set rochester at defiance and carried wells and stewart to their coaches and so back to whitehall without any scandal save that which rochester made with his tongue but my lord of bucking ham being willing to stand well with the queens ladies did take rochester aside in the park and say to him that if he did not hold his tongue he would kill him as he had shrewsbury and pray which of the two ladies would hold your graces horse this time  said rochestermeaniing that my lady shrewsbury had done the like while buckingham wvias killing her husband no matter wv hich said buckingham  so be you are lead and whether rochester was afraid or whether as sonie said lie owed his grace money wvhich lie could not pay i know not at all events rochester hath been very civil to the ladies illy mistress anl aliss wellsthe which was very far indeed from his habit however either because of his fear of the king or of buckingham lie had nought to say this was ann hughes tale and my dear mistress was much troubled at the doings of those in high places so after the welshwoman was gone and i returned from the convoy she did question me tightly of all those whom i knew and as to my masters conduct concerning which i made the best answers i could assuring her what is quite true that there is none at court to compare to her for beauty that ever i have seen and that mr pepys do always so uphold it and she was much comfortedthat is at first and i did sit and keep her company almost till her husband did return as lie said fromn working late at deptford and but for its ending this had been a good day and memorable to me in that my dear lady showed me much kindness far above her wont yet can i not cure her of the fits of fury she hath about her husband if he be halfanhour late in returning even if the poor man is but at his booksellers she will not believe but vents her displeasure at large which is but little profit and makes for the unhappiness of the house as for example this very night it happened to myself for mistress pepys was very severe with me because that i went as far as whitehall with the welsh girl ann hughes she was sitting crying when i came back and at first would not speak to me saying that nobody loved her or cared whether she were dead or alivethat it was like master like man for the one courted the mistresses and the other the maids and as for her that she would go to a nunnery to end her days nor would she listen to a word when i told her how that ann hughes was bespoken to the aforesaid rowland who was indeed her bachelor and kinsman she stood before me like a pretty fury stamping her foot and swearing she had done wrong ever to take notice of a clown fit only for the society of waitingmaids she bade me go find doll in the kitchen and in a storm of anger entering her chamber she shut and bolted the door tis eleven of the clock and my master is just come home perturbed enough when i told him what had befallen but presently up he goes to make his excuses as best he may yet do i thank the stars which had made me this night but plain william hewer a bachelor clerk anid not mr samuel pepys of the navy office         after a long interval i take my pen to write in my book which is lean by comparison with the stout quartos amr saml pepys ktaves at the office but yet contains much matter of which mr pepys is unaware now my dear mistress hath been grievously upset these last days because of deb willet concerning whom she need not have troubled herself dear soul for deb cares no more for my master than she doth for the king though indeed she suffers him about her as and the more is the pity all maids must who enter into condition in the house of a man like my master but deb is a right good maid as i do know come of respectable folk and with an aunt who comes here to take her news and lace necktrappings every monday yes i own itshe and i are very friendly when we meet on the steps near pauls churchyard by the bench under the yewtree where she do tell me her troubles and of our masters everlasting running afterherwhich is a shame in the house he having so many out of doors but tis little i can do for deb willet my duty lying to my mistress who as is her nature cannot abide her for indeed they are much too alike to agree of two pretty women in a house one must have the mastery and it is my lady mistress who will not bear with deb the maid is 1 think well enough content to have a lad of her own age about the house and doth confide much in me yea kissing me very kindly from the very first day as she had oppor tunity or i could make one but suchlike favours not being as yet so scarce with me i do not set them all down in shorthand lest i should never come by another as my master doth thinking poor fool  that nobody is the wiser for if my mistress be jealous of master saxiiuel and leads him an vail life by night in the daytime she is more than ever upon poor debs tofknot on iny account not that she hath any reason or even excusedeb and i understanding each other as well as ever did maid and clerk constantly in and out of one masters house yet must poor delb go and i wot as much upon my account as on that of mlaster samuel who doth think himself the sole cause and lets my mistress trample over him but this is no way with such a woman as my mistressperhaps not with any woman for ine i go immediately to the attic and begin to pack my chest to leave the house then in ten minutes at the most up comes my mistress to my chamberdoor crying and begging me to abide for my kind masters sakewhich i always do ah little he guesses what he owes me in the way of peaceful homecomings and cheerful readings of nepotisme which puts him and us all to sleep but there is no right gratitude in man mr pepys cherishes me chiefly because my summations are correct and that i do set his tangier accounts in proper order for binding yet he owes me much more than that and most likely will never knoow it yet i care not let others be mercenary an theyl will i labour for the virtue which is its own reward for last lords day i did hear mr giffords sermon on the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees which made nme think mighty well of myself especially since mr pepys cast it up to me seeing me wvith willet that i did cower like a thief and wear my cloak like a ruffian to escape his observation yet will he come at my umistresss request to my lodging and there eat a custard with deb willet to his hearts content looking from one woman to the other like a pasha which makes me laugh within meyea and outwardly too heaven forgive me when i did catch debs eye or my ladys for our samuel is ever jealous of the wrong fly in his apothecarys ointmentas formerly of posturing jack pembleton the dancing master and lately my mistress and i have sent a piping bombastical fellow named sheres across his bows as they say in the office to draw his fire he is so everlastingly dawdling after his knepps and worse that if any trim lad talks five minutes with my mistress or deb he will sulk for days for as the saying is as you do yourself so you dread your neighbour  but since i ceased to go to her fathers in longacre with my mistress mr pepys pays no heed to my comings and goings especially since i have entered upon the wvellfurnished lodgings of mine own which ve all find to be mighty convenient times and seasons being observed so little doth samuel know of the ways of women that he did actually send me with a letter which he had written to deb willet after she was gone calling her evil names at his wifes desire and to satisfy her so i did show the letter first to deb to break her of any folly that might be in her mind about a man who would not stand to his deeds but let the brunt fall on a girl then having served i brought the original back to samuel for his comfort onl first swearing my mistress to secrecy and the bridling of her tongue i let her know what mr pepys had sent me to do with the letter so though he hath great honour at the navy office and is the great man with my lord duke master samnuel is under sad eclipse where most he desires to shinethat is with his womenfolkthe reason being that lie is over subtle while a plain man though a clerk call take the wall off him by mere simplicity of dealing it gives inv mistress who hath a pretty teasing wit and is ever ready for revelige mighty pleasure to say to her husband when he comes home m2r pepys what a wonderful thing is providence today while out in the coach who should get in beside me you know how light of foot these travelled men are but master sheres or perhaps if it hath rained today being in the row buying green watered moire who should i light upon but mr sheres who most kindly walked home with me  all which is only a little tat  for samuels tit and pleases mi miistress mightily yet all this trouble i take for no advantage to myself but only that i may be a good chief clerk to my master and eke my mistresss most faithful bachelor because i do desire that my master reform his ways and cease to dance doll tearsheet corantos athwart london which indeed is most unseemly for the secretary of his majesty s navy surely the warning of mny mistress is not to be set down against ine as though i were a common informer as for our sins my master is old enough to know better and i young enough to repent when my time comesthough even now i wear my fools cap with a difference as to nmy dear mistress there is none like her for beauty she is worth all whitehall for wit the city cannot show her like had i such a wife wild horses would not draw me from home of nights but theresamuels gravelstones will not kill him much this side of a hundred and my dear ladys repute is as dear to me as my own credit for an honest man so i will abide by her yes for her sake and for a little of his own being as he is a foolish loveable inan i will abide by samuel ior niy dear mistress is hot of soul full of fine quick angers as often causeless as not and i love her for them as one may a child petulant and freshlipped if any try to hold her as like as not she will peck and bite like a wild bird caught in the hands none knows her so well as i being long of the house and as it were of her faction often have i desired to write fully of her thoughts and sufferingsaye and may do so some day because she had the daintiness of an english rose with the lightness and sparkle of her french epernay wineat once light heady and headstrong but it may be that between her husband and i we will keep her memory green for truth it is and i own it samuel also doth love her well perhaps in spite of his corantos better than any this credit i do him and with the more grace that i know well it is to me and not to him that she owes her chosen happiness for she calls me her sparrowhawk and when she beats up into an anger i fly into one ten times as fierce and sudden wxhen she vapours i overvapour her till she weeps when she scolds i storm when she is petulant i grow violent thus she loves me as save for her continued jealousies she doth never samuel yet for all that i cannot break her of these tempers it is pierce this and knepp  that if he comes in a quarterofan hour latewomen that are not worth the filip of her own rosy forefinger and indeed the poor man hath not the spirit to bid her go hang and mind her own businessas i should and do who am not her husband when she vexes me about deb willet but samuel sits like a calf behind a dripping hedge that waits for the storm to blow over poor man i have it in my heart to be sorry for him at times so simple he is and thinks himself so clever yet suffers my lady to ride roughshod over him which however is useful to me as pointing the difference between us making her prefer him who says go and be hanged i  and so slamns the doorto snailbacked samuel who crawls at her feet weeping as often as she hath caught him at his tricks so it was in this business of her tirewoman and companion deb it has been a grievous discomfortable time and the house barely fit to eat meat in for what with crying of rack and ruin treachery and vengeance from mistress elizabeth pepys and samuel on the crawl among the tablelegs beseeching his wife to tread upon him bah i it makes me sick to my soul and i do pet and confort deb every day and have found her a good convenient lodging and byandby she shall have a better place i took her box on1 my shoulder before the very face of my mistress who dared not vent her fury on both samuel and me at once but i do fear she banks it up all the more fiercely against poor debto whom however henceforward it will matter but little at saying of the final goodbye i did even take debs hand and set my lips to it this i did with intent because my lady looks best in a pretty french fury all white with scarlet spot on1 each cheekbone and her eyes sparking like mr hobbes lightnling machine ah it was a rare sight indeed and for a mall that could stand up to it something to be lived for but samuel who grovelled knew nothing about such pleasures how indeed should he for ever knighterranting hither and thither like a roaming grimalkin alas that i should write such words about my dear master or would i save in my secret notanda and to be upsides with him who doubtless doth grievously comb my hair in his many quartos but with deb round the corner and my mistress on tiptoe uncertain whether to embrace or poignard me surely i can afford to be generous yes a good fellow is sam of the navy office but in the matter of women he loveth not wisely but too many so is rightly beloved of none not knowing the art concerning which i william hewer his clerk could draw him certain sealed orders which poor wretch 1 he would not have the sense to act upon for true it is that once a gadabout always a gadabout and samuel follows one woman only until another croses the trail love with our samuel is no more and no less than a childrens game of crosstag led through london streets by players who have never seen each other before yet doth he serve his friends wellthat is so long as they be men and for the others i would rather not be a woman friend of samuels because of the reasons foreanent stated june 4th 1703i have just returned to my house in clapham from the vault near the communion table in the church of the crutched friars in which place i did make my eternal farewells to my oldest friend mr samuel pepys once my dear master the husband of my yet dearer mistress and of late my comrade and partneras he was good enough to style himselffor long dwelling under my roof and so deigning to accept the kindly gratitude of his ancient pupil and chief clerk when i glance at the leaves i wrote fourandthirty years ago i declare i do not know myself for the same man then i was an illconditioned selfconceited coxcombworthy neither of the consolatiomis of my dear mistress nor the lighter favours of mistress willet who in due time married her cousin archibald and died respected by all the landlady of the jolly postboy inn on the bristol road strange it is to think that deb kept her light head and easy ways so long above the daisies when within a year of my writing down all these fancies elizabeth pepys the like of whom the sun hath never since shone on was carried out to st olaves church in our parish of the crutched friars ave a broken man was her husband my master and as for me who was but her servant i never rightly cared to look on woman since and even unto this last year of grace two old men were used to steal in the grey light of the tenth of a london november to st olaves church and stand there a long while bareheaded he at the head and i at the feet now they two lie together wife and husband mayhap more contentedly than they ever did in their hot youth and i being left alone will go my pilgrimage from claphain twice a year instead of once on the day of his death and on hers yet do i think my master ever kept a little sting of jealousy against his servant perhaps as suspecting me of having revealed his doublings about deb and othersperhaps oil account of my dear mistress herself 1 know not for in his will he left me nought but fifty pounds and a mourning ring as he did to the very servants of my house but the truth is a man will forgive all differencesonerniig god man fortune doctrine angers politic and slights personalsave only the offence that cometlh like that first one of eden by a woman betwixt mans and man this is the sin unpardonable yet god knows it is with the kindest of thoughts in my heart that i turn my mourning ring upon my finger and set me as an ancient faithful clerk to carry out my masters wishes for in all save the eden apple the discord which came by a woman he loved me none better s b crockett,britain

the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,britain
new novels the heavenly twins by sarah grand 3 vols heinemann  the heavenly twins  is one of those books which it is difficult to criticise satisfactorily for in spite of its chaotic and haphazard arrangement and its unsatisfactory ending it is so full of interest and the characters are so eccentrically humorous yet true that one feels inclined to pardon all its faults and give oneself up to unreserved enjoyment of it the author is a lady who in the flippant words of the oxford magazine has come to believe in the mission of woman to civilise man to teach him to know his position and to estimate hers if he can but her ideas on the subject are dreadfully vague and though she gives some interesting cases of women who attempt the problem of readjusting the relations of the sexes their efforts are not crowned with much success there is indeed a shadowy personage called ideala who has organised a mysterious society for this purpose and for though propagation of a new religion and who it is hinted has obtained a solution of the difficulties but her utterances are too rare and dark to be intelligible the heavenly twins has been compared in a contemporary journal to 4 the story of an african farm the comparison is just inasmuch as both authors express a bitter sense of revolt against existing social arrangements both have a theory that to woman is reserved the future salvation of the world without any definite conception of how she is to accomplish it and in both books the intensity of feeling and the wealth of imagination are so great that the story is overburdened with a plethora of material which might with advantage have been distributed over several novels in this book there are at least two stories that of the heavenly twins which gives the book its title and that of evadne the wife who was no wife the twins angelica and diavolo young barbarians utterly devoid of ali respect conventionality or decency are among the most delightful and amusing children in fiction the conception of twosuch little monsters and the frank description of the superfluity of their naughtiness without encroachment on the domains of the improbable would alone have been remarkable  but to have made them at the same time lovable and to have related their unconventional escapades with the delicacy and good taste of  sarah grand shows something more than mere cleverness in the story of evadne which is really quite unconnected with the other except from the accident that evadne happened to know the twins the author has surmounted a great difficulty with success evadnes story is briefly this she is a thoughtful and clever girl of strong will who marries a man thinking him to be all that is good and noble on her wedding day she discovers that his character has been that of a  man of pleasure and she only consents to stay with him on the condition that they shall not live in the relations of husband and wife in spite of all protests from her parents and her friends and though it is represented to her that she might be the means of elevating him and she never swerves from her determination the difficulty lies not in making the reader intellectually approve of her position  the natural tendency would be theoretically to justify such a character but to regard her as almost repulsively cold and heartless especially as tne husband loyally abides by the arrangement and is represented as rather gentlemanly and pleasant than otherwise but in so vividly describing the state of her mind and the womanliness of her nature that the only feeling of the reader is sympathy and pity for her and this sarah grand has done she has created a true and delicate woman not a strongminded female made up of cold abstractions whom one instinctively thinks of ns wearing pincenez and short hair considerations of space permit us to notice one more point only in this bookthe quiet humour with which the author describes the characters she has the inestimable merit of hardly ever obtruding her personal views of them on the reader who is allowed to discover their peculiarities for himself gradually as if he were living with them this is especially the case with some of the minor characters mr hamilton wells for example the submissive father who makes tea and talks crude platitudes appears at first as if he were merely an insignificant bore  and that is how he would strike a stranger but closer acquaintance with him reveals the fact that he is a humourist of a high order and that the seeming platitudes are generally very much to the point in case another edition is printed it may be mentioned that either the author or the printer is shaky in french witness ilya deslonguers par envy dattaquer and the maxim given as  chercher la femme,britain
general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public interests were not so absorbing as personal talk and home side stones c w boase,britain
monsieur beaucaire by booth tarkington murray this little sketchwhether entirely supposititious or not it would be pedantic to inquireis handled with a lightness and brevity which do infinite credit to the american author it is a vivid account of the adventures of a french duke of the royal blood at bath in the eighteenth century and the brilliant audacious yet withal dignified attitude of this prince is most happily suggested without any superfluity of words he masquerades for his private purposes in this resort of fashion first as a gambling barber and then as the due de chateaurien laughing in his sleeve at the dullwitted englishmen who incited by the duke of wintersets personal animosity try to hunt him down as a laquais the scene in the pump room when his identity is disclosed by the arrival of his brother and the french ambassador to the consternation of his enemies and still more of the lady mary carlisle who had loved him until she was taught to scorn him as a servant is told with real charm and pathos the little book is furnished with some graceful illustrations  mojnsieur bfaucaire by booth tarkington illutrated 2 bd net mlurray we have here a pretty dainty little tale not very creditable teo our english manners in the elegant times of beau nash it is true but containing so excellent a lesson on the deceitfulrness of appearances that we must needs receive it heartily though at the hands of a frenchman if the adventures of the gallant duc dorleans be not founded on tradition it is skilfully and gracefully invented the book is ambitiously got up but the picture and decorations are better in intention than in execution,britain
the amateur cracksman by e w hornung 6s methuen the last story in this volume  the gift of the emperor is by no means they best but it redeems the book from the reproach of its being the greatest incentive ever penned to spirited youth to make a brilliant living by the burglars art tle two gentlemanly thieves have to give in at last to the svperior intelligence of mackenzie the detective but up to that point their careers were made just a little too fascinating for safety one ofthe cracksmenrather a poor thingoccasionally earned a little money by literature not enough to keep him honest there is something charming in the literary scruples of this not fiery scrupulous burglar i suffered from a persistent ineffectual feeling after stale verse i could manage but it did not pay to personal paragraphs and the baser journalism i could not and i would not stoop the other is a fargreater man he brought real genius to the pursuit of the calling of his leisure his ostensible interest in life was ctickethe played for the  gentlemen and it is interesting to learn that he thought one game a very pretty way of keeping your hand in for the other as for the stories we shall not retell any of them they should be read but only by strongminded persons warranted not merely safe from a hankering after their neighbours spoons but from hankering after the risky and successful capture of these spoons  fiction the amateur cracksman by e w hornung methuen  co 6s the modern story of crime its detection or its perpetration wherein the leading factor is ingenuity of plot probably deserves more critical attention than it has hitherto received it may not be the highest development of fiction but it is a form of literary artor rather to be cautious there is no reason why it should not be a form of literary art three things are necessary so g h lews has told us to good literaturevision sincerity and esthetic beauty now no one would deny that the sherlock holmes series for example has both vision and sincerity dr conan doyle  realises intensely and his best work is obviously and thoroughly sincere that his outlook is narrow and his characters crudely conventionalised is beside the point for all art is narrow when compared to life and all art must be more or less conventional without convention one could not have form where dr doyle and his imitators fall short is in the quality of aesthetic beauty of which most of them seem to have not the slightest perception it must be said however for mr e w hornung that his book does disclose a certain feeling for beauty his search for the precise epithet is sometimes quite successful and all his stories have a gracefulness of contour not often to be observed in this species of work mr hornung is avowedly an imitator or shall we say a  flatterer  of dr doyle yet he has his originalities his hero a j raffles possesses it is true the sherlock holmes attributes but he uses them for the commission of crimes not for their punishment of course he was not really a criminalonly an amateur though an amateur who could meet and beat most professionals he had a code of honour and stuck to it otherwise he would have been impossible as a hero  we shall have our work cut out was all i said 44 and do you suppose i should be keen on it if we hadnt cried raffles my dear fellow i would rob st pauls cathedral if i could but i could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasnt looking than i could bag the apples out of an old womans basket even that little business laat month was a sordid affair but it was necessary and i think its strategy redeemed it to some extent now theres some credit and more sport in going where they boast theyre on their guard against you the bank of england for example is the ideal crib and so on till all ones notions of right and wrong are turned topeyturvey a j raffles is successful in all his little affairs till the last one when a grim scottish detective who has shadowed him throughout brings him up all standing the amateur escapes with his life from a precarious position and probably mr hornungs intention is that at a future date he shall renew his doubtful activities the book is distinctly a good one it is perhaps inferior to its exemplar in that wealth of corroborative detail which convinces and that ingenuity of weaving which enthrals but on the other hand it has a lightness and brightness which dr doyle never attempted  notes on novels these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the amateur cracksman by e w hornung the dedication of this book runs thus  to a c d this form of flattery the initials stand for a conan doyle and the form of flattery is imitation mr hornungs oentral character being one taffies a sherlockholmes type of man who however not only detects crimes but also perpetrates them for the sheer fun of the thing a very readable set of stories methuen 6s  the amateur cracksman by e w hor nung methuen  co tins is a highly pleasing story of two young bloods who engage in the agreeable pastime of burglary in order to stave off the bankruptcy staring them in the face one of them as is natural is the mastermind while the other is the weak fool who allows himself to be driven though it must be admitted that he takes very kindly and skilfully to his novel business at first things go fairly smoothly but they make the mistake of getting entangled with some professional burglars and the cunning sleuthhound of the law tracks them down on a german lloyd steamer the different chapters are almost detached stories in themselves and have enough fun and adventure in them to satisfy the most exacting appetite this is certainly a much more amusing book than mr hornungs last volume of short stories,britain
poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,britain

yorkshire oddities incidents aud strange events by s baringgould ma in two volumes london  john hodges 1875 to ono familiar with the stories and traditions of yorkshire there is perhaps not much new matter to be gathered from this amusing compilation it is no slight acquisition however to county literature to have such biographical curiosities collected within the compass of two handy volumes and new interest is imparted to the subject by though literary skill displayed by mr baringgould in handling his materials he is very happy too in his attempts to reproduce on pajier the dialect of that part of the west riding with which he seems best acquainted among the less widelyknown characters whose history has been unearthed by mr baringgould is dr john hildrop rector of wath near ripon about the middle of last century he was a man of obscure birth who had worked himself up in the world by his talents aud great conversational powers the story of his presentation to the living is well worth repeating lord ailesbury the patron surprised hildrop with the offer of it at a time when he was regarding himself as utterly hopeless helpless and friendless amazed at such generosity he waited upon his lordship to express all decent and grateful acknowledgments but was roughly though goodnaturedly cut short with  sir pray spare your speeches and keep your compliments to yourself you arc under no manner of obligation to me for had i known a moro deserving man in england than yourself you should not have had it dr hildrop published anonymously many volumes and detached essays little known at the present time though some of them were clever and witty enough in their own day to be attributed to swift some very good anecdotes of this gifted man are told in these pages memoirs of remarkable clergymen indeed fill up no inconsiderable space in this enumeration of yorkshire oddities the living of leaseholme in the north riding was held by three successive generations of the wikeses for upwards of a century all of them men of great literary talents popular preachers eccentric in character and much given to the bottle the first of the family who held the living was presented to it by charles h not for any theological attainments which he possessed but as a reward to an old soldier of his father for wikes when a captain in the army of charles i had received a wound in his leg which incapacitated him from further active service and no more economical method of pensioning him could bo suggested another instance of rewarding bravery in arms by promotion in the church we have met with in the case of samuel drake vicar of pontefract after the restoration whose chief qualifications for though dignity of doctor of divinity appeared to bo judging by the certificates of his acquaintances his having served in the marching army or the garrisons of newark and pontefract throughout the whole civil war one of though most amusing portions of though book is the account of jemmy hirst a native of rawcliffe who used to wear a broadbrimmed hat of lambskin fully nine feet in circumference a waistcoat and breeches of many colours and yellow boots instead of pictures he would hang the walls of his room with bits of old iron and coils of rope in one place an old fryingpan in another a rusty sword a piece of a chair or a jug the eccentricities of this man having reached the ears of george the third the king desired to have an interview with him  the following report of the conversation which passed has been preserved his majesty  asked jemmy how he liked london  i like it weel enow answered the oddity   but i hadnt any idea afore yesterday and today there were sae niony fools in it   indeed  said the king  you pay us a very poor compliment mr hirst i did not know that we were so badly olf for wisdom in london perhaps that is an article in such demand in yorkshire that thero is none to spare for cockneys   why ill tell thee how it were said jemmy  when i come into t toun yesterday and to thy house today the streets were full o crowds of folks gathered as thick as owt to see me just a cause i happd to ho dressed different frae other folk  and as i were waiting out yonder i t forechamber there were one o thy sarvants burst out laughing at me but i reckon i spoiled his ruined shirt for him and punished his impertinence one o thy sarvants was a noble duke in attendance whose loss of gravity hirst had insisted upon treating as a fit of convulsions by dashing water in his face pulling his nose and using other pretended endeavours to bring him round again strict historical accuracy even in the humble matter of dates is hardly to be looked for in such a work  unless indeed we are to accept some of these characters as greater natural oddities than mr baringgould seems to bc awtare of himself among facts related of  nancy nicholson the termagant it is hard to believe that she was born in 1718 and died in 1854 aged sixtynine that she wrote a certain letter when seventyfour years old and that important events in her career happened on february 29 1845 an eminent pedestrian we are informed walked from canterbury to london bridge twentyseven years before he was born  while a distinguished blind joiner had but sixty years of life though he was born in 1808 and died in 1873 we feel the less hesitation in drawing attention to these curious facts as they are quoted from the second edition of the book and thus after an opportunity had been afforded the author of correcting them if untrue j j cartwright,britain

litetature daniel deronda daniel deronda by george eliot london w blackwood and sons we know not which to admire most in  daniel deronda the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as gwendolen and daniel deronda or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at derondas wedding feast  the entire cohen family with the one exception of though baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home in none of george eliots novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present one cannot lay down though last volume of  daniel deronda without some tribute of astonishment at though vast range of the authors powers it is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of english societya great work of course in either view on the whole perhaps ones impression is that in  daniel deronda george eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place and a novelist in the second the purely pictorial purpose in this as in others of her novels is subordinate to the ethical in  daniel deronda strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist the dominant motive as revealed in the last volume of the work is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time in its last pages instead of an invitation to esthetic or humorous reverie we seem to find a trumpetcall to young men and maidensto young men to take example by the noble gravity of daniel deronda and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of gwendolen harleth and its tragic consequences a protest against low sordid personal aims an incentive to a higher worthier more aspiring and humane life such would seem to be the ruling intention of daniel deronda wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are which may satisfy though flaunting gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities the earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of though elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes and the full earnestness of the authors purpose was not certain till the very last and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind this says much for though success with which george eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should as a whole point somewhere teach some lesson have some aspiration towards the infinite all through the skilful dissection of gwendolens heartlessness which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon we feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology by a most skilful professor of the social microscope this creature a product of the generation is dissected before us and put piece by piece under the glass wo look on peep in our turn through the instrument and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure professor eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments but having completed her pathological lecture she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature an undeveloped organ  note this i will return to it another time in though course of though exposition we have become deeply interested in this organ and byandby our curiosity is gratified we aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system it seems as if george eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of casaubon and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of gwendolen and mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and lightheaded conceit and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm there must be hundreds of girls more or less like gwendolen among george eliots readers and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies perhaps if george eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint she ought to have increased gwendolens punishment for after all gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles being left with two thousand ayear and a developed conscience and free to marry if she chooses a hearty handsome young cousin whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days but then gwendolens crime after all was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened and her wicked husband is drowned if grandcourt had turned np again or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning but it would have been too miserable besides that if sho had been left in physical misery we could not have had though same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration if gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period daniel deronda is equally an example to the young man of though period in the gravity and loftiness of his aims our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig and would jeer at his relations with gwendolen as impossible  and their judgement of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race his grave meditative nature his profound composure and selfcontrol his steady persistent passion are eminently hebraic and are meant to be so he is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin it is an influence too to which in our earnest moments we are not incapable of yielding ourselves and with the healthiest of results there is a something in it also which is repellent to the average common sense of englishmen that something is well expressed by sir hugo mullinger an admirably drawn type of the cultivated english squire i have long expected something remarkable from you dan  but for gods sake dont go into any eccentricities i can tolerate any mans difference of opinion hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic at this stago of though world if a man wants to be tikn seriously ho must keep clear of melodrama dont misunderstand mo i am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account i only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic especially if he wanted defending you have a passion for people who arc pelted dan im sorry for them too but so far as company goes its a kid ground of selection still sir hugo does not quarrel with daniel deronda for his innacy ho respects his earnestness and here again he is typical of his countrymen by far the most wonderful part of  daniel deronda its chief claim to admiration as an achievement is its picture of the jews its exemplification and analysis of different forms of jewish life some of them not so estimable as deronda and mordecai we have spoken of the cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work in the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of lapidoth mirahs father who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some musiclessons ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat  thc look of impudent suavity the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the hebrew race the interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond who has something of the character of charles mathewss awful dad and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated is very finely conceived there are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making lapidoths impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his sons stern rebuke  or who having done so would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek the humour of lapidoths subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to mordecai and deronda and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry is exquisite george eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly among the minor characters in  daniel deronda  there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is lapidoth when we think of all that there is in daniel deronda we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist still wthen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art we must admit that it has deficiencies it is a subepidermic subcutaneous kind of art the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology it is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness and that dullness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment the novel is not a work of art pure and simple but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts there is a want of courage in george eliot she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves she must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing what principles of their nature they are illustrating she is too professorial too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him nevertheless she is a great writer a great genius and if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum total  literature daniel deronda by george eliot edin burgh and london w blackwood  sons 187g independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections daniel deronda is eminently interesting because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light though merits as well as the faults of its writer merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated and are not as is too frequently the case blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of english letters on the one hand we are prepared to find and we do find an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character  a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade attitudes transient moods of mind complex feelings and the like which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer  an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims and a wonderful sympathy with humanity so far at least as it is congenial to the writer on the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and onesided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent to this black list must be added some decided faults in style in discussing a book which is in everybodys hands it will be well to show how the above points are brought out and how they affect the general merit of the book rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot in the matter of character then wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture the part of gwendolen harleth is throughout an overwhelming success and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch her selfwilled youth the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character which her selfconfidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her her instant surrender at though touch of material discomfort  the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit the helpless outbursts of selfpity of rage of supplication which follow that collapse  the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience  the torrent of remorse and final prostration of willare all imagined with a firmness and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence which cannot but command admiration the husband is almost equally admirable  indeed ones admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly and that the author would like ns to detest grandcourt yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait as he appears before us acting with strict politeness to his wife in no way violent towards ber if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language and employing for the purposes of his refined tyranny nothing stronger than the methods of  awful rule and right supremacy if he should appear to anyone all the more detestable it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival the more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them and an additional interest is impaitcd by the discovery that gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of dorothea animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy it might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that though soul of casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as grandcourt but these nro fancies the point of present importance is that though interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so of the third according to though authors design the first personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken the blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coatcollar continually who at the age of some twenty years wished  to get rid of a merely english attitude in studies  who in the words of his best friend was disposed  to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium   of whom it was impossible to believe in the still more graphic words of the friends sister  that he had a tailors bill and used boothooks who never does a wicked thing and never says one that is not priggishis a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike but refuse to admit him as possible only once perhaps is he humanwhen he persuades himself on all sorts of ethicophysicohistorical grounds that he should like to be a jew solely becauso as that very sensible woman his mother the princess discovers at once he wishes to marry a fascinating jewess we cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this  faultless monster  as hero though pleas put forward in the book that it is only though  average man  and the  dull man  that will not understand him and that the average man is not very clear about though structure of his own retina and the dull mans  dullness subsists notwithstanding his lack of belief in it in the first place the cases are not parallel for though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough and in the second place though dull man may fairly retort  if you are a great novelist make me believe in your characters in this dearth or rather distortion of central interest the minor characters do not help us much they are far less individual and far less elaborate than is usual with george eliot daniel deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of mdmes holt and cadwalladcr poy ser and glegg sir hugo mullinger with hans meyrick and his sister mab makes a shift to fill up the gap but it is but a shift lapidoth the unwelcome father is chiefly welcome to us the readers because ol the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers mordecai we must not we suppose call a minor character but of him more hereafter there is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which george eliot has accustomed us though account of gwendolens grounds of confidence  the charming etching of though wagon passing pennieote keeto ry the scene of thc first ride with grandcourt gwendolen nfl cr klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover the wonderful sketch of grandcourt sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature deronda in the synagogue the stables at the abbey  thc waiting at genoa for the princess  and lastly gwendolens retrospect of ofleiulonc are all effects ofthe finest in this kind but this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed as it seems t o us in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in themselves and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged might have freer play no one can read daniel de rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that though author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed we cannot away in a novel with emotive memory and dynamic quality with  hymning of cancerous vices  and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss with  coercive types  and  spiritual perpetuation still less with hundreds ol phrases less notable because bulkier xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough and they are all more or less intelligible to decentlyeducated people no doubt though truths of science mental and physical are here as elsewhere in our authors works rendered with astonishing correctness and facility but it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate in philosophy in politics in religion in art a novelist when he speaks in his own person should have no opinion should be of no sect should indulge in no argot if we are dissatisfied with though jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition we do not in the slightest degree feel  imperfect sympathy with jews and we hold that shylock had the best of the argument but the question here is whether the phase of judaism now exhibited the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle we think that it has not and we are not to be converted by references to the average man the average man has never experienced the passion of hamlet of othello or of lear he is not capable of the chivalry of esmond of the devotion of des grieux of the charity of the vicar of wakefield but he has experienced and he is capable of something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms now the  samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine to borrow a phrase from allon locke into which mordecai initiates deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human they aro not only  willworship but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling poetry could legitimately treat them indeed many of mordecais traits may be recognised as we think moro happily placedin though sephardo of the spanish gypsy they are no doubt interesting historically they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph but for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest of prose novels should be wrought it is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with though manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of mordecai probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic if though thing was to be done it could hardly have been done better assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive we should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion which characterise the subjects and situations of the authors earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present it is a timehonoured transition and one which has before now yielded excellent results but in reality the transition is not in this case great because the subjectmatter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment the book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of george eliots work which lurks even in the scenes of clerical life which is hardly in abeyance in adam bede which is though professed motive of the mill on the floss of the spanish gypsy and of romola which gives charm to the slightness of silas mar uer  to wit the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty hither than the op posing instinct all for love and the world well lost perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application but this is matter of opinion the matter of fact remains that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between gwendolens misery and the prosperity of the sleek deronda the same moral as we had in hettys catastrophe in the fate which punished maggie tullivers partial declension from the standard in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from duke silvas passion in the degradation and death of tito melema though same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of felix holt for a hero and of dorothea brook for a heroine the moral and the standard and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity and deal deserved rebuke to though lax pleasureseeking which has been considered a vice at all times and is not openly considered a virtue even yet in though illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits and much exquisitelydrawn surrounding but perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the

the draytons and the davenants a story of the civil wars new novels by the author of  chronicles of the schonbergcotta family nelson  sons the author of the  chronicles of the schonbergcotta family as a writer of agreeable and harmless fiction for girls has won and deserves to hold a place in public estimation considerably above the rank and file of our ordinary pro ducers of readable tales if she cannot be  is credited with originality and distinctiveness of  a thought she at least chooses her own guides  n and exercises private judgement in deciding as to the way in which she ought to regard whatever subject she writes about her purpose is always womanly and commendable and hitherto she has not given us a story that lacks signs of honest labour it is therefore with no ordinary reluctance that we utter an adverse verdict respecting  the draytons and the davenants a work in which mrs charles is found dealing with a subject that is altogether beyond her powers as indeed it would prove beyond the capacity of the majority of our living novelists if we put aside the indiscretion of this choice of subject the failure may be fairly described as the result of causes over which the lady could not in the nature of things exercise any adequate control she appears to have prepared herself conscientiously for her task by reading the orthodox authorities of these later day on matters pertaining to the great struggle for civil and religious liberty in the seventeenth century and having gleaned a sufficient quantity of information from historians and biographers she has reproduced it in a form that will not be acceptable to any numerous body of readers here and there the book is marked by cleverness a tone of feminine simplicity and goodness pervades every part of it but notwithstanding its redeeming points this tale of two families who espoused opposite sides in the struggle betwixt despotism and lawthe draytons being a gentle puritan family and the davenants a house of royalists and courtiers is tedious unreal and in no respect entertaining the story has to be picked out of the diaries of the two heroines lettice davenant and olive drayton who maintain a close friendship notwithstanding the political differences of the families and their own want of unanimity on questions relating to public matters and these diaries are so burdened with digressions into the history of the period and with reflections upon the conduct of parties and leaders that it is by no means easy to keep the thread of the romance in sight neither in thought nor style are the journals satisfactory reflections of the epoch the young women who kept them are not such damsels as danced at whitehall or prayed god to bless the patriotic endeavours of colonels hampden and cromwell but young ladies who have read carlyle and walter scott constitutional histories and the christian year at the outset of the book the author endeavours to imitate the stiffness and antiquated phraseology of commonplace seventeenth  century prose but long before the wearisome volume is drawing to a close her attempts at verbal simulation are discontinued and save that she occasionally uses  wondrous as an adverb or violates some petty rule of modern literary style she makes her young ladies write away just as young ladies are trained to write in brighton boardingschools here is a specimen of olives flowing sentences  still throughout that dreary winter negotiations went on between the parliament and his majesty at the castle of carisbrook more and more hopeless as more and more men became mournfully convinced of the kings untruth until in april 1648 when from the upper windows of our house i could see on the one side the trees bursting into leaf in st jamess park and on the other the river gleaming with a thousand tints of green and gold as it reflected the wooded gardens of the palaces and mansions from westminster to the temple when the fleets of swans began to pass by on their way to build their nests in the reedy islets by richmond or kew the news came from all quarters that amidst all this sweet stir of natural life the country was stirring with fatal insurrections from kent to the scottish borders the reader of pages upon pages written in this style finds it difficult to imagine himself perusing a diary kept by au english lady in the seventeenth century,britain
the laird of norlaw a scottish story by the author of  margaret maitland e 3 vols hurst and blackett thia is the story of three brothers who by the death of a weak and amiable father were left to do battle with the world of their love for their mother and their other loves their brave endeavour the success of one of them in working out the problem of their fathers life the final triumph of them all over the sorrows that stood whii their father died about the threshold of the house of norlaw the story is very natural and pleasant and the characterpainting quiet in its tone has truth and grace to recommend it,britain

the ratpit by patrick macgill herbert jenkins 6s net this is a welter of misery and squalor it is to the authors credit that the irish and the scotch surroundings of his characters are suggestively differentiatedmore so indeed than the personages themselves who are rather deficient in distinctive features altogether the volume bears the stamp of veracity and firsthand experience the technique shows considerable improvement on the last work of mr macgill but he strikes us as not yet having attained a proper distance from the life he describes there is little substance in the tale and it is not only spun out to excessive length but also liable to degenerate into melodrama as in the closing scene or in that meeting of brother and sister that recalls maupassants story le port the chief defect is this that the handling is not sufficiently objective to turn the book into a purely artistic achievement while on the other hand it is too impersonal not bitter enough to gain its fullest possible force as an indictment of certain social conditions lastly we venture to think that the readers sympathies will not be sharpened but blunted by such a litany of suffering instead of rising exasperated from its perusal and vowing vengeance on a system which permits such atrocities he will heave a sigh of relief and feel thunderingly glad that the heroine has at last thought fit to die now whose fault is that is it the authors yet defective sense of measure or the publishers determination to have so many unnecessary thousand words for this sixshilling venture  the ratpit by patrick macgill jenkins g the author of  children of the dead end  has given us a second powerful novel which contains eyren more sordid incidents and the sordidness is less relieved by gleams of humour in fact the danger of the author haunted himself with the misery in the yvorld passing on such an obsession to his reader is a very real one in a time of great tragedy we are more ready perhaps to welcome a novel yvhich helps us to adjust our perspective better than this book as a portrayal of the women counterparts to the men in his former work it may serve a purpose we are not unfortunately in a position to deny that the life of fallen women reaches lower depths of degradation than that of the vagrant class among men though yve shall cherish doubts concerning thc writers opening scenes of irish life as long as we can lt is not that wc do not believe that there are extremes of selfishness to be found among the irish priesthood and merchants who in outoftheway parts grind the poor but if these pictures are taken from actual life then mr macgill has neglected a duty in not furnishing the world with chapter and verse the worst evil revealed in recent factory reports is the practice of paying outworkers with goods instead of money ie trucking with outworkers but mr macgill makes no allusion to this,britain
  witclt stories collected by eliza lynn linton i chapman c halla more ghastly christinas book than this could not be imaginednor yet one more admirably calculated to keep readers awake at the hour when churchyards yawn a strange task to muster this terrible squadron of cruel and revolting dreams for the author of  realities the result is tiresome because of its monotony betwixt cowardice on the one side and craziness on the other there is only a plot of ground narrow as a monastery garden for any foot to tread threadbare the tales are all one like to the other the yearning ignorant creature greedy to extort from life that which life can afford to no one conceiving that by bribery and corruption and a mad bartering of his future hopes he might obtain a short reign of enjoyment or of vengeanceand finding in the moment of imaginary satisfaction the coveted fruit a mere growth of dead sea apples is in all of them prominent and of course by the dupe stands in the shadow the knave what makes such a book all the more sickening is the conviction that all our boasted advance in intelligence has up to the time present carried us only a short distance beyond the verge of that old world in which fanatical credulity was rebuked by fanatical cruelty the punishment of death it is true has ceased to be frequent the witchfinder with his investigating needles and judicial thumbscrews has gone the way of the ketches but the intense morbid curiosity the resolution to pry into all those mysterious relations of sense with spirit which ever and anon elude precise inquisition and may continue to do so until imperfect humanity shall be perfected are neither dead nor asleep,britain

dynevor terrace or the clue of life a    e  m ti iti i new n0vkls bythe author of  the heir of redclyffe 2 vols parker  sonwe may anticipate that the author of tlie heir of redclyffe will publish in course of time a little library of novels for quiet family reading not so striking in their interest as her earlier production but truthful vigorous closelycopied portfolios of social pictures each lending itself to the development of a simple drama the leading merit of these books is their general freedom from overwrought effects even the attempt to work every subdivision of the several stories up to a sort of false climax is natural and not suggestive of artifice or effort the author writes intently and freely forgetting few circumstances in the lives of her everyday heroes and heroines and telling her tale as though the reader were bound to appreciate the importance of every incident that occurs to any violet or virginia laura or lucy in the whole round of her unobtrusive romance hence arise at once the faults and the virtues of her style she never loses herself in declamation or tinsels her dialogues with tragic metaphors or swamps her scenery with aurora radiance or puts greek fire into the mouths of eloquent villains the characters have no appearance of being dressed for the stage they converse with ease and spirit above all there are few interludes of pretentious satire or philosophic rambling on the other hand the action is wearisomely slow the events are remarkably small and the moral is imperfectly fetched out from the level mass of personal and local details as in  heartsease there is scarcely any story only a placid surface painted with groups landscapes and interiors and now and then opening upon a passage of dramatic vitality writing less characteristic

the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn novels c by henry kingsley 3 vols macmillan  cothere is a strange family likeness pervading the novels of the two messrs kingsleycharles and henry both affectthe former may claim the honour of having inventedwhat is called  muscular christianity in both the ideal of goodness is intimately associated with a sound digestion strong nerves high spirits and a large development of the animal powers not only the mens sana but the anima pura must be lodged  in corpore sano for real pietywe refer chiefly though not entirely to the sterner sexto be dyspeptic is difficult to be  larmoyant would be impossible the characteristics are utterly incongruous charity indeed forbids them to lay down as a broad principle that no true christian can be subject to neuralgia or afraid of bronchitis or weak on his pins or less than four feet ten inches in stature or too feeble to fight the blacksmith and too timid to shoot a robber but the best that can be said for suchjfrail brethren is that appearances are strongly against them according to the kingsley theory the perfect christian should be recognizable if exhumed a thousand years hence by some theological cuvier of the thirtieth century by the size of his skeleton and the magnificent expansion of his os frontis living in our own day this species may be known chiefly by their vigorous vitality their endurance of fatigue the inextinguishable laughter with which they greet every crisis of suffering or adversity and the stalwart strength1 which upon adequate provocation they can impart to the extensor muscles of the forearm written upon these principles the romances of either kingsley are full of excitement and interest their heroes are apt to display all manner of feats of personal prowess and of course find innumerable opportunities for such performances the author of  geoffrey hamlyna younger brother we believe of the rector of eldertonnow makes his first appearance as the writer of an independent work hitherto his productions have been limited to a few u spirited  articles in frasers magazine describing the sporting capabilities of australia his present work relates chiefly to the same country with which mr h kingsley is evidently well acquainted and concerning which he has much that is at once novel and interesting to tell the family theory indeed prospers amazingly by emigration to a new country in our old and hotpressed society at home we are forced to confess that  muscular christianity  is somewhat out of place it is not altogether true and might occasionally be found inconvenient a muscular christian of the kingsley type would sometimes under contingencies that must now and then occur in england find himself entangled in rather disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by heury kings ley 3 vols macmillan and co mr henry kingsley follows with much vigour his brothers lead and iu the school of muscular christianity which his brother has founded he may prove better claim upon the rank of a head master than that of founders kin the author of geoffrey hamlyn not only talks about life in australis but knows it and as this field of exertion occupies a large place in the ethical system he is helping to develope bia australian experience is worth a doctorate to the new teacher there are four stalwart lovers of a wayward heroine who marries unwisely and at last finds herself an orphan with an infant at the breast her husband a transported coiner he was transported by the judge to a place where he became captain of a gang of bushrangers killed his own son snd wss hung most of the other persons of ths story are transported also by the author to australia there it may be that the compactness of the plot suffers a little from the full and fresh impression of the country that the author has to give lt is a defect not to be quarrelled with the sketches sro all free and lifelike here is for example a suggestion of the writers quality the story passes from the

good grass again we ought to start and get some store cattle mr henry kingsley hints sn intention to write more the public will be glad to read more for his power evidently is not of a kind to be exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the artificial precincts of three volumes post 8vo no matter who or what the interlocutors may be mr henry kingsley however has written a book which the public will be more inclined to read than to criticize and we commend them to each other,britain
when knighthood was in flower by edin cas koden 6s sands there could scarcely be a more temptirg subject for the writer of romance than the lovestory of charles brandon son of a simple knight of suffolk and the princess mary sister of henry viii nor could it we think be more charmingly set mr charles major edwin caskoden forth than in the quaint language of sir edwin caskoden henrys gay little 1 master of the dance only it is well to make it clear that the book is not an historical study it is a lovestory pure and simple and its appeal is to the readers heart rather than to his head it is the widest appeal however and no doubt the example of the fifty thousand americans who have already enjoyed the book will be followed eagerly by as many britons the beautiful and wilful princess has an imperious charm which few will be able to resist and her maid of honour lady jane bolingbroke is only second to her mistress to us indeed she is a more attractive character just as her gallant and determined little knight wins more of our regard than brandon himself who seems a trifle overpowered by the insistence of the princesss wooing the book is full of gaiety and vivacity for sir edwin kas an infectious lightheartedness the author is to be especially congratulated oal the personality of his  chronicler whose innocent and cheerful egotism is one of the most refreshing touches in a bright and delightful story,britain

traditions of lancashire second series by j roby mral 2 vols 8vo rich indeed in legendary lore is the county of lancashire and well for her traditions is it that they have fallen into such able hands as those of mr roby to a thorough knowledge of antiquarian learning he unites a brilliant imagination and is thus enabled to throw over the pile of hoar antiquity the light which renders the ruin so beautiful and attractive with the wand of the magician he stays the rapidly departing shadows  more than this he imparts a new substance and reality to them and gives relief and prominence to things but dimly seen  he rescues  the relics of the past from the oblivion to which they were hastening and by a rare union of the antique and the modern he illustrates manners and customs now obsolete by tales that however bearing upon tradition have still a distinct and separate interest to recommend them if his imagination is tempted to overstep her limits the severity of the antiquary restrains her flight and thus the keeping is perfect the style of the work is another of its excellencieswhether of humour or of pathoswhether of love or terrorwhether in the whirlwind of passion or in ladys bower in the conflict of the elements or in the placid lakenature in her summer beauty or the howling of the winters stormmr roby has appropriate language for each and all nor is it the least of his merits that in every tale there is a fine moral tone and a moral purpose while the impress of a pious mind is visibly stamped upon the whole it is true that we are constantly reminded of sir walter scott and this has been supposed to detract from the originality of mr robys work we do not think so for it is not in parallel passages or in characters for which we could find a prototype in the author of waverley  but we find ourselves perpetually saying  this is in scotts manner meaning that if scott had chosen the subject he would thus have treated it and this we consider as very high praise having thus briefly offered our opinion of the general merits of mr robys volumes we proceed to give extacts which will justify our praise premising that in tales none of which are of any length it is difficult to discover passages which can afford a fair specimen of mr robys manner the following describes the person of that young pretender to the crown of england in the reign of henry the seventh by some historians said to be lambert simnel and by others the unfortunate earl of warwick it was at the peel or castle of fouldrey that his mimic and motley court was first held before a long narrow table near the bed and on a highbacked oaken chair sat the young pretender he was dressed in a richly embroidered gown the sleeves wide and hanging down from the wrists like lappets on his head was a low cap surmounted by long waving feathers and his manners and appearance were not devoid of grace and gentility he displayed considerable selfpossession and wore his kingly honours with great assurance he was of a fair and sanguine complexion pale rather than clear and his hair clustered in heavy ringlets on his shoulders a rapid and somewhat uncertain motion of the eye and his mouth not weil closed showed that although he might have been schooled to the exhibition and could wear the outward show of firmness and decision yet in the hour of emergency and in the day of trial his fortitude would in all likelihood forsake him then we have portraits of his followers  at his right hand eat the priest in a white cassock and scapulary a black hood thrown back upon his shoulders exhibited the form and dismsition of his head to great advantage his features were large expressive and commanding the fire of a brilliant grey eye was scarcely tempered by his overhanging brows though at times the spirit seemed to retire behind their grim shadows to survey more securely and unobservedly the aspect and appearances without  swartz the flemish general a blunt military chieftain was at his side a black bushy beard some inches in advance of his honest goodhumoured face was placed in strong contrast with the wary pale and somewhat dubious aspect of the priest  kildare the irish deputy and lovel with several of the senior officers and captains were assembled round the table  the room was lofty lighted by a small pointed window and contained the luxury of a fireplace in which lay some blazing embers  a grateful and refreshing sight in that chill and ungenial atmosphere by the artifices of margaret duchess of burgundy a mysterious personage of gigantic stature appears and directs the councils of the rebels and is by them supposed to be supernatural this fact comes to the knowledge of the abbot of furness a loyal adherent of henryby dispatches intercepted by a halfwitted fellow dick empson and an attempt is made to turn this information to account and to induce tiie rebels to quit the castle of mr robys talent for the ludicrous not unmixed with the terrible we could not mention a better specimen than the tale entitled  the dule upo dun but we must refer our readers to the volumes where they will find much that is curious and all entertaining we will not repeat our praise of the work  we hope soon to find mr roby employed with equal talent on the traditions of other counties assured that so diligent a reaper will gather an abundant harvest wherever he shall put in his sickle his defence of tradition against the charges of the historian in the introduction to this series is a learned and clever dissertation,britain
tales of a cruel country by gerald cumberland grant richards 7s net salonique and the near east which is so strangely and elusively european is the cruel country  from which mr cumberland has brought us these swift and vivid little dramas twoandtwentv impressionistic stories each with its attribution to a friend each brimful of levantine spice and sun and each tender or cruel or both conveyed with masterly briefness and completeness katya the handsome sensual greek girl modified by a belgian convent school is one of the best of mr cumberlands spoils she appears and reappears and her creator paints her almost full lengtha subtle and intriguing novelty a figure of sophisticated comedy in the tragic manner loot dedicated to mr frank harris is perhaps the most powerful with its background of conflagration and its stage setting of horror and abduction but all these tales are well done and whether they tell of revenge in a gloomy bath or of an idyll on a sunny hillside they have distinction to justify their faciculated format and a tang of attic pepper to give point to their collective title,britain
other new books annals of a doss house by sydney hallifax mr hallifax writes from firsthand knowledge of a typical dosshouse which he calls the  phoenix located in a turning out of ratcliffhighway each of the ten chapters is concerned with a separate story  nearly all are sad and nearly all end with death perhaps this was inevitable yet we feel that a book of this description having in view a very definite humanitarian object would have gained in force by some presentment of the brighter side the festivities of a dosshouse are certainly as educational as its squalor its degradation its inevitable immorality but it must not be supposed that mr hallifax has produced a book on lines too common in such records there is no narrowness of outlook no inability to take the larger view mr hallifax has sympathy humour and also a healthy and confident optimism one never doubts for a moment the truth of the facts stated there they are set down broadly clearly and on the whole convincingly parson drew the  dossers  bishop  tear em liza and  gentleman jack  are all alive but we think the fictional form which mr hallifax has chosen detracts from their force so handled they make better reading no doubt but for philanthropic and reformative purposes a bare statement of facts would better have served the authors purpose these  annals however are a worthy contribution to the sociology of a subject which has been tinkered at for many years it is good for us to be presented with such narratives from the pen of a man who has both seen and understood george allen 2s 6d,britain

the aran inlands by j m synge dublin maunsel 5s net the aran islands it is probably necessary to remind the ignorant saxon are three small islands lying off the west coast of ireland about thirty miles from galway the largest is about nine miles long and the inhabitants who are for the most part still strangely primitive gain their living by burning kelp fishing and tilling their scant fields though the soil is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed in the following year and the straw is all the profit of his four visits to these islands mr synge the author of the playboy of the western world the play that caused so much disturbance at the abbey theatre dublin has written an attractive book which while relating his experiences simply and without literary artifice is rendered charming by tne authors sympathy with the kindly men and women of whom he writes  mr synge has a fine eye for colour and he has painted a truthful though sombre picture of the islands with their grey clouds and grey seas and slaty limestone rocks the men dressed in indigo and grey and the women in red petticoats with grey shawls twisted round their heads there is little division of labour on these barren rocks  every man is a good sailor an expert fisherman sufficiently wise in agriculture to till his poor fields clever enough with his hands to make a cradle or a coffin they dwell in thatched cottages whose chief room the kitchen has an earth floor and open rafters and two doors facing each other one open and one shut according to the wind in this room the men sit on the wet foggy days that are so frequent on these desolate islands drinking perhaps the grey poteen in a haze of turf smoke and listening to the wonderful tales of the old men or talking endlessly of tides and fish and the price of kelp in connemara but in all the speech of this simple folk there sounds a note of despondency a sadness of things passing for their growing sons leave the islands nowadays for america or the mainland unwilling that like their fathers before them they should spend their days in snatching a poor livelihood from the winds and the sea even here the gaelic seems to be dying out and the younger men are no longer ready to believe in the fairies whose strange hatred of the human race colours so many of the stories that mr synge has collected from the old men of the islands progress which may not spare either beauty or simplicity is reaching these primitive men and women at last and we therefore owe a double debt to mr synge for having written this book before it was too late and for having written it so well mr j b yeats contributes some clever illustrations,britain

say spare her mieaning the heroine i am earl of desmnorid and then quietly observes in a note as if the change of the one little word made none in the sense the substitution of he for me is the only alteration i have made in desmonds dying words historical facts in short are placed here or placed there just as it best suits what appears to the author the interest of 1her narrative this however is plainly overstepping the bounds of the historical romance no liberties should be taken with authenlticated matters  and it is quite superfluous for there must always be roomi enough for the play of fiancy in the deficiencies of records the subject of the tale is the revolt and ruin of desmnondthe prince of a large portion of the south of ireland in the reign of elizabeth the fitzgeralds and the butlers were hereditary enernies and the chiefs personal foes ormiond was a protestant a lord of the pale and in favour with the court desmond a catholic the descendant of a family of english origin but ipsis ilibernis iiicrnior the acknowledged chief of the catholic partythe opponent of the palethe resister of political oppression and of course in ill odour at court in a conflict with oimonds feudatories lhe was taken prisoner and conveyed to ormonds castlewhere in disguise his daughter gained access to him and first fascinated ornionds son and whence he was at last released uipon galling terms  wrung into undutifulness as he well expressed it by his enemies he entered into schemes for the rescue of his country and the gratification of his own revenge  but before the committal of any overt act lhe was entrapped by the queens troops and carried to londonwhither his daughter again followed him in his absence his friends pursued the plan and found themselves in a condition to propose terms to the government and desmond was dispatched by the government to dublin to confirm them treacherously treated or suspecting it desmond made his escape before the compact was signed and openly took up arms against the queen joincel by a few spanish forces and sanctioned by the pope though occasionally successful lhe was finally beaten in detailhis castles one after another destroyedand himnself a wanderer and dying of hunger was killed for the price that had been setupon his head his vast estates were lavishled among the courtiersamong some perhaps who had been mainly instrumental in pushing him to extremities of whom raleigh got 40000 acres spencer the poet had above 3000 wdith these for the most part historical details is mixed up a tale of no great interest from the dearth of incident consisting of the loves of desmonds daughter and ormonds son she is of course all that is beautiful and intelligent but with all her accomplishments and wisdom ardent and impetuous as the most uncurbed of irish maidens tilarles too is the observed of all observersthe preux chevsaliera most faithful and impassioned lover and one who encounters perils upon perils to prove bis devotion and win his ladys love but filial duty and the claims of patriotism bind her to her fathers destiny whose wanderings she shares and whose death she witnessescthe sight of which also added to previous exhaustion kills the unhappy maid herself the main object of the accomplished writer is of course to exhibit inl detail the miserable management of ireland in the reign of elizabeth and this is successfully done there can be little doubt the irish were driven into rebellion for the sake of forfeitures the queen herself when reports of the rebellion were brought to the council exclaimed if it goes on it will be better for you for there will be estates foryou all the most spirited parts ofthe work are the scenes where elizabeth figures coarse and imperious to the life the reader will of course take our opinion relative to this performanceone of no little pretension he may gather from its mag nificent prefacefor what it is worth but it is only fair to let him know that the work has been honoured by the approval of one of the first critics of the agethe right hionourable the lord rector of the university of glasgowthat is mr thomas campbell who it may be safely presumed by the importunity of the authors friends and his own has been forced into a complimentary opinion of what he probably scarcely glanced at,britain

any people w e fear if it be much longer cultirated our new works will be more calculated for the nursery than the library of a fullgrown and rational i gentleman in makingr this remark we by i no means wish to discourage iniquiries into the traditions however absurd or the prejudices however unjust of the people all we wish is that they may not be pushed too far f rom the sublime to the ridiculous is but one step as napoleon once observed and the renmark iarticularly applies to works of literature ithe author of the delightfiil little volume before us appears to have hit the happy mediumr he has not only given us some highly amusing tales illustrative of the superstitions of the irish peasantry but hie has proved himself an admirable r arontetur and eihibits a rery curious but striking picture of irish society for it cannot be denied that the superstitions of every people have a powerful  fluence on their conduc t 0d d antnenr of uti nking to m1ir crofton croker the author of the volume before us the world is already indebted for an excellent work on ireland he is not only a very pleasing writer but as a most intimate knowledge of ireland her traditions and the character manners and customs of the people indeed we know no writer of the present day whose information on such points is more extensive and we should almost designate him the sir wnalter scott of the emerald isle  his work contains some admirable tales illustrative of irish superstitions and his notes display a ery minute acquaintance with his subject wvith these remarks we shall select two or three of these irish legends the first is entitled the lrg end of bottlehill come listen to a tale of times of old come listen to me it was in the good days when the little people most impudently called fairies were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times that a farmer named mlick purcell rented a few acres of barren around in the neighbourlhood of the once celebrated preceptory of mourne situated about three miles from mallow and thirteen from  the beautiful city called cork mick had a wife and family they all did what they could and that was but little for the poor mans had no child grown up big enough to help him iii his work and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children and to milk the one cow and to boil the potatoes and carry the eggs to market to mallow but with all they could do twas hard enough on them to pay the rent well they did manacre it for a good while but at last came a bad year and the little grain of oats was all spoiled and the chickens died of the pip and the pi got the measlesshe was sold in m1allow and brought almost nothing and poor miick found that he hadnt enough to half pay his rent and two gales were due why then mlolly says lie  what 11 we do v  wisha then mavournene wlhat would you do but take the cow to the fair of cork and sell her says she and monday is fair day and so you must go tomorrow that the poor beast may be rested agaim the fair and what 11 we do when she s gone says mick sorrowfully  never a know i know lick but sure god wont leave us without him mick and you know bow good he was to us when poor little billy was sick and we had nothingr at all for him to take that good doctor gentlemen at ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk and how he gave us two shillinos and how he sent the things and the bottles for the child and gave me my breakfast when i went over to ask a question so he did and how lhe came to see billy and never left off his goodness till he was quite well  oh you are always that way molly and i believe you are right after all so i wont be sorry for selling the cow but ill go tomorrow and you must put a needle and thread  rough my coat tor you know  tis ripped wider the arn molly told himi he shouldl have every th1inhg righlit and about twelve oclock next dav he left her getting a charge not to sell his cowv except for the higlles penny mick promised to nliud it and went his way along the road he drove his cow slowly through the little stream which crosses it and rtins under the old walls of mlourne as he passel lie glanced hlis eves upon the towers and one of the old elder trees which were only then little bits of switches oh then if i only had half the money thats buried in you tisnt drivinx thlis poor cow 1 d he now why thenr isn t it too bad that it should be there covered over with earth and many a one besides me wvantingr it well if it s gods will i ll have some money myzself coming lack so sayigs he moved on after his beast twas a fine dav and the sunt shone brightly on the walls of the old abbey as hie passed under them  hie then crossed an extensive mountain tract and after six long min es lhe came to the top of that hillbottle luill tis called now but that was not the name of it thlen and jtust there a mnan overtook him g good morrow says he  good morrow kindly sas amick looking at the stranger who was a

and mlick retraced the road towards his cabin but lhe could not help turding back his head to look after the purchaser of his cow who was nowhere to lbe seen   lord between us and harm  said mick  he cant belong to this earth but swhere is the cow  she too was gone and iick went homeward muttering prayers and bolling fast the bottle and what would i do if it broke thought hie  oh  but i 11 take care of that  so he put it into his bosom and went on anxious to prove his bottle and loubting of the reception he should meet from his wife lbalancing his anxieties wvith his expectation his fears wviti his hopes he reached home in the evenina and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney oh mick are you come back sure you werent at cork all the way w that has happened to

hie ininded the old i inwas adviice loosened lis wifes gsp aud i the bottle again in his bosom poor placed tle bottle arain in him bosom poor lolly sat down crying while mick told her his story with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm his wife could not hell believing him particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest who indeed never liscouraged her belief in the fairies may be he didnt know she believed in them and may be he believed them himself she got up however without saying one word and began to sweep thfe earthen floor with a bunch of heath then she tilied up every thing and put out the long table and spread the clean cloth for she had only one upon it anl alick placing the bottle on the ground looked at it and said bottle do your duty  l look thiere  look there marnmy  sail his chubby eldest son a loy about five years old look there  look there  and he sprung to his mothers side as two tiny3 little fellows rose like liglht froin the bottle and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver full of the finest victuals that ever were seen and when all wvas done wvent into the bottle again alick and his wife looked at every thingr with astonishment they had never seen such plates and dishles before and didnt think they could ever admire them enough the very sight almost took away their appetites but at length amolly said come and sit down mick and try and eat a bit sure you ought to be hungry after such a good days work w hy then the man told no lie about the bottle lick sat down after putting the children to the table and they made a hearty meal though they couldnt taste half thle dishes now says molly  i wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these file things again they waited but no one came so molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully saying  why then mick that was no lie sure enough  but you ll be a rich mhan yet ialick purcell  mick and his wife and children went to their bed not to sleep but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want and to take more land amick xvent to cork and sold his plate and bought a horse and cart and began to show that he was making money and tley did all they could to keep thle bottle a secret buat for all that their landlord found it out for hie came to alick one lay and asked him where he got all his mnoneysure it was not by the farm  and hie bothered him so much that at last amick told him of the biottle eis lanidlord offered him a deal of money for it but mliek would not give it till at last lhe offered to give hinm all his farm for ever so alick whco was very irich thought hed never want any more money and gave limn the bottle  but mlick was mistaken  he and his famnily spent money as if there  as no end of it and to make the story short they became poorer and poorer till at las tipev hlad nothing left but one cow and mick once more drove his cow before him to sell hier at cork fair hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle it was hardly daybreak when lie left   1 home and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill the mists were sleep ing in the valleys and curling like snoke wreaths upon the brown heath around hin the sun rose on his left and just at his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured forth its joyous matin song ascending into the clear blue sky  till its form like a speck in the airinesn blending and thrilling with music was nmelting in light m mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark 1ut thinking notwithstanding all the time of tile little old man when just as he reached tfie summit of the hill and cast his eves over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voice well mick purcell j toll you you would be a rich man  nieed then sure enough 1 was thats no lie for you sir good morning to you but it is not rich i an nowbut leave you another bottle for i want it nowv as much w i did long ago so if you have it sir here is the cow for it an ad here is tthe bottle said the old man smilinr  you know what to do witiit c s4 oh  then sure i do as good right i have well farewell for ever mlick purcell i told you you would be a rich man and good bye to you sir said mick as he turned back  and good luck to you and good luck to the big hillit wantsa namebottle hillgood bye sir good bye so mick walked back as fast as he could never looking after the whitefaced little gentlenman and the cow so anxious was he to brings home the bottlewell he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw molly oh  sure ife another bottle   arrah  then have you  why then you re a lucky man amick purcell thats whifat you are  in an instant she put ev ery thing right and alick looking at his bottle exult inglt cried out  bottle do your duty in a twinkling two great stout men with bio cudgels issued from the bottle i do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they event again mlick as soon as be recovered got up and looked about him he thomudht and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him lhe wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to mick v well what do you want now nothing sir only i heave another bottle 01 ho is it as good as the first yes sir and better if you like i will slhow it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen c come along then so saying mick was brought into the great hall where he sat bis old battle standing hi h uwn a shep ah ihail says he to himself if may be i woat have you by and by tic now says his landlord show us our bottle mick set it on the floor and 4nered the words in a moment the landlord nvas tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaringr and sprawling and kicking and 5hrieking wine  cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out  stop those two devils mick purcell or ill have you hanged   they never shall stop said amick till i get my own bottle that i see up there at top of that slhelf 4 give it down to him give it down to hnim before wve are all killed  says the landlord m mick put his bottle in his bosom in iumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried them home i need not lengthen mv story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upoil i it ay and so twill be always bottle luill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story the next legend we shall quote is entitled tihe field of boliauns torn fitzpatrick was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who lived at ballincollig tom was just turned of nineandtwentywhen he met the following adventure and was as clever clean tight goodlooking a boy as any in the whole county cork one fine day in harvestit was indeed ladyday in harvest that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the yeartom was taking a ramble through the ground and went sauntering along the sunny side of a lhedge thinking in himself where would be the great harin if people instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all were to shake out the hay and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge specially as the weather had been rather broken of late he all of a sudden heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge dear me said tom  but isnt it surprising to hear the storieclhatters sinainry so late in the season  so tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if hie was right in his guess the noise stopped but as tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hledge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee dinny dony bit of an old man with a little innffy of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head and a deeshy daushy leather apron hangingbefore him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a ittle piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and thern sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heelpiece on a bit of a broglue just fitting for himself well by the powers  said tom to himself  i often etad toll of the cluricaune and to tell gods truth i never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest if i go knowingly to work i in a made man they say a body must never take their eyes off them or they 11 escape  tom now stole on a little farther with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse or as we read in books the rattlesnake does withl the birds he wants to enchant so when he got up quite close to him  god bless your work neighbour said tom  the little man raised up his head and thank you kindly said he  i wonder youd be working on the holiday  said tom t hats my own business not yours was the reply w jrell may be you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there  said torn i  that i will with pleasure said lhe its good beer b

there you re out i made it of hcath of heath  said tom bursting out laughint sure you dont think me to be such a fool as to believe that  i io as you please said he  but what i tell you is the truth did you never hear tell of the danes   and that i did said tom  werent them the fellows we gave such a licking when they thouglht to take limerick from us  hen  said the little man drily is that all you know about the matter  well but about them danes said tom  why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in mny family ever since  twill you give a body a taste of your beer  said tom  ill tell you what it is young manit wouild be fitter for you to be lookiing after your fathiers property thaii to be botherino decent quiet people with your foolish questions there now while you re idling away your time here theres the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corni all about  tom was taken so by surprise with this that lhe wvas just on the very point of turnincr round when he recollected himself so afiraid that the like might happen again hie made a grab at the cluricaune and catught him up in his hand but in his hurry hie overset the pitcher and spilled all the beer so that hie could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was isle then swore what lhe would not do to him if he did not show him where his money wats tom looked so nwicked and so bloodyminded that the little man was quite frightened so says hli 1 conie along n itll j11c a 0o111 le of fields off and ill show vvu a tvtw k jf gold i i i i i so they went and tom held the cluricaune fast in his hand and never took his eves from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog for the cluricaune seemed out of pure mischief to pick out the hardest and most con trary way till at last they came to a geat field all full of boliaun buies ragweed and the cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun and says hie  dig under that bohiaun and youll get the vreat crock all full of guineas tom in his hurry had never minded three bringing a spade with him so he thought to run home and fetch one and that hie might know the place again he took off one of h red garters and tied it round the boliaun i suppose said the cluricaune very civilly youve no farther occasion for me no says tom you may go away now if you please and god speed you and may good lick attend you wherever you go well good bye to you tom fitzpatrick said the luricaune and much good may do you with what youll get 6so tom ran for the dear life till hle came home anid got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the tield of boliauns but when hie got there lo arnd behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very identical model of his own tied about it and as to diggi g up the wnhole field that was all nonsense for there was more than forty good irish acres in it so tom cane horn again with

rodney stone by a conan doyle 6s smitb elder this must rank among the first four or five of mr doyles books perhaps only  micah clarke  and  sherlock holmes  surpass it there is a certainty and a power in his dealing with english history that he never attains to when he seeks his theme abroad rodney stone is a tale of the early part of this century and will probably have a sequel as the hero at the end is only at the outset of his career going off with nelson to trafalgar nelson is hardly needed for this story but he gives the colour of the period and we forgive any irrelevance if he is the link between this tale and the next it is the prize ring not the navy that is the inspirer of the book the ring is supposed just now to be very wholesome at least an admiration for its past is held to check decadence so be it the fighting scenes are vigorous enough to please such as are interested in the fancy though we think greater dignity would have been given to the sport had mr doi le allowed jim to take part in the famous encounter with wvilson no the blacksmiths nephew had been discovered to be the heir to a peerage and from  rodney stone smith elder and co the noble father refused his consent but for the sake ot the ring mr doyle should have forced him we confess to admiring the fighting scenes in ignorance we feel ourselves on safer ground in applauding the writers charitable and intelligent belief often and diversely expressed in the course of the story that beneath the foolish foppery and idleness and frivolous eccentricities of the bucks of the day lay the capability of something solid and noble and valiant,britain

the mixture as before mr lucas must be careful his fount of humour is running very thin he has successfully made many delightful volumes out of very little but he is here trying to make a delightful volume out of nothing in form the story is an annexe to  the vermilion box that set of   verena in the midst a kind of story by e v lucas 8s 61 net methuen letters exhibiting the minds of some typical people during the war it was everything we expect from mr lucas and it remains a subtle and invaluable footnote to history the present set of correspondents includes only one of the old the preternaturally wise protagonist or protoepistolist richard haven who is wiser than ever and a little less human the plot if plot it may be called is simple a lady of forts rich in money and friends has a spinal accident and lies in bed for months while her friends bombard her with letters after their kind mr lucas manages in his effortless way to sketch their characters between the lines of their letters  but it is all just a little too carefully arranged and made there are of course many lucasian  notions many delightful quotations and a pervading sunniness touched with a little healthy northeasterly irony part of the story is verenas difficulty in disposing of her money we offer mr lucas a suggestion there is a kind of person to whom he once refers not very sympathetically has he ever thought of the elementary schoolmaster harassed and weary with the difficulties inherent and gratuitous of his public service with comparatively long holidays to spend and nothing to spend on them  has the wanderer in venice and florence ever considered what wandering in italy would mean to such a man  verena might like the suggestion cf the verena holiday fellowships g s,britain
annals of a quiet neighboured by george mac donald ma author of  david elgin brod  ia three volumes hurst and blackett this is a republication of a story written for dr guthries sunday magazine mr macdonald has never published anything that did not sustain the credit he earned as a poet years ago when he wrote  within and without he is a poet with true spiritual insight into life a largehearted earnest man who is steadily and slowly winning his way to the public recognition of his power that is wide already but not yet so wide and so thorough as it will be when he fairly comes into his own his writings until now have all breathed naturally his own sound and liberal religious spirit but in this book he is rather like a man who has given up natural breathing and gasps under the constraint of stays or a tight neckcloth either the sense that he wa writing fiction to be read on sundays by scotch people who had thought the stories in  good words profane or the conditions under which he was required to work must be made answerable for the comparative failure the book is one that only a man of genius could bave written it is full of good thought and good writing but it is the work of an artist in fetters who is obliged to have a perfect incumbent for his hero and to give at least one of the incumbents sermons in the course of his tale mr macdonald struggles to break through the conventional sunday crust with some romance for which he makes apology wherever it appears and which does not cotna to any kindly growth he tries aiso to realise his own large wholesome notion of a pattern priest but after all full as it is of good we put the book aside as a mistake it was net a mistake in the sunday magazine where it gate to hundreds of dull people a few gleams of the light they seldom or never see but it was a mistake to reprint it for it will not range fairly with mr macdonalds works in which his genius was free and he was all himself this passage may represent something of the fine thought in which the book abounds and a little also of the overstrain that came of the present sense of a sour elder watchful for a shortcoming in the devoutness of his sunday

mmmtnt mis ehildaen t  annals of a quiet neighbourhood by george mdonald ma 3 vols hurst  blackett these annals of n quiet neighbourhood are very quietly told so quietly that the recital becomes at times monotonous the authors reflections aro those of an amiable unworldly and piously disposed thinker but they are often obscurely and ambiguously expressed the writer lacks the condensing power of our old and quaint writers who in a few words could give utterance to sentiments for which mr mdonald requires many pages the experiences of a clergyman in a quiet country parish must sometimes be of a more exciting character than can bc found in lengthy colloquies with parishioners or spiritual disquisitions on natural objects though authors first walk in his new quiet neighbourhood suggests to him an incessant flow of analogies drawn from everything on which his eye rests for instance he comes upon a bank bordered by pollards  now he complains  pollards always make me miserable in the first place they look ill used in the next place they look tame in the third place they look very ugly i had not learned then to honour them on the ground that they yield not a jot to the adversity of their circumstances that if they must be pollards they still will be trees and what they may not do with grace they will yet do with bounty that in short their life bursts forth despite of all that is done to repress and destroy their individuality when you have once learned to honour anything love i3 not far off at least that has always been my experience but as i said before i had not yet learned to honour pollards and therefore they made me miserable fortunately at this juncture an old countryman comes past who requests leave to look on the new 2rtwms face and the parson overhears a little child say he should like to be a painter  to help god paint the sky both these remarks  give rise to a renewal of moral reflections but j happily they are of a more cheerful tendency i than before the good man work3 very hard  and doubtless does an infinite amount of good  particularly to the poorer part of his congre gation but he is most anxious his readers  should know all his good qualities and being a very transparent character every feeling of  his mind is so visible that he might have spared himself and his readers the long explanations he so constantly gives of his actions and motives really he is however indefatigable in his attentions to his poor and we are quite glad for his own sake to hear what comfortable luncheons he finds in the vicarage between the services on sundays and how careful he is to have the church well wanned where he preaches such long sermons one of these discourses is given at full length and it is not a particularly original specimen of its kind some of the worthy incumbents ideas are certainly peculiar he considers it a great mistake to teach children that they have soulsthe consequence being  that they think of their souls as of something which is not themselves for what a man has cannot be himself hence when they are told that their souls go to heaven they think of their selves as lying in the grave they ought to be taught that they have bodies and that their bodies die while they themselves live on then they will not think that they will be laid in the grave it is making altogether too much of the body and is indicative of an evil tendency to materialism that we talk ns if we possessed souls instead of being souls no doubt this is very good in the abstract but sundayschool teachers would we think hesitate before adopting it without qualification  the story which carries though authors sentiments is a very slight one it is the mere connecting link of the thoughts and facts that present themselves to the authors mind it is not well sustained it is disjointed mid is perpetually falling to the ground there is an air of feebleness about it and a seeming want of practice is discernible in the recital that is somewhat surprising considering that the author has already exercised his pen in several previous works the annals of a quiet neighbourhood moreover can scarcely be called a novel the story is so subservient to the religious conversations  but as it was written originally for a sunday publication this was to be expected there arc two or three incidents that if well worked up might have risen to the level of the romantic and even of the sensational the characters are numerous among them is a decidedly disagreeablesome may think even a wickedold lady whose illused and of course beautiful daughter seeks a change from her magnificent but uncomfortable home by giving herself and ultimately her money to the worthy but prosy vicar then we have a pedantic and precocious child of twelve years of age who flings herself into a pond during the clergymans first visit to see if he will jump in after her and who talks bitterly of other peoples matrimonial prospects in a very unjuvenile manner these are the principals but they have numerous supernumeraries in the shape of old people who have prosy chat with their pastor and young ones who ask for his advice and do not take it the solemn pastor unbends occasionally once to the extent of giving a christmas party to his congregation in which are conspicuous countrydances carols plenty of tea and supper and wordsworths ballads this kind of book will probably find admittance into many a family circle where works of fiction do not generally meet with a cordial reception the intention of the writer is good but the execution falls short of the intent,britain

of his mortal sojourn being however a inan of no profession with some remains of activity he is miserable for want of something to do and after long dobating finally resolves on a literary courseproposing to furnish a publication  which should throw some light on tihe manners of scotland as they were and to contrast them occasionally with such as are imow fashionable in the same country

women now are goes about working wonders mr horace smiths old woman is not a gipsy like the great original mistress margaret merriles nor is she a washerwoman like coopers old woman but she is an old woman in blacknot a black bonnet but a black gown  and she appears at all times and in all places where she is least expected or desired crying out u anathema maranatha  to the unspeakable consternation of the hearers lor why we know not these words arc words of great force and give a terrible and sublime character to thc speaker at least so the author obviously imagines we shall not attempt to describe the plot of this novel because nothing is more wearisome both to the writer and the reader than the description of the plot of a dull tale which this is if ever there was a lnll tale in this world suffice it to say that the scene of the story is laid in england france and the united provinces the time that of the commonwealth and charles h the characters of course roundheads and cavaliers the hero is the son of an old cavalier against whose house the old woman in black has conceived a mortal enmity she haunts the old cavalier says  anathema  maranatha to him discovers his plots against the government of cromwell and denounces him until the end of the third volume of course we do not find out the cause of all this pother when however we arrive at that part of the book where secrets can no longer be kept the old woman becomes communicative and explains her actions her motives and other important mysteries toa stranger in consideration of his performing a certain small service for her which she could not perform for herself and what was that service  that we must state  for nothing so absurd was ever before conceived we think in the brain of a romancer the old woman tells a certain youth whom she meets with in her walks that she has collected with great pain and toil an immense pile of faggots for the express purpose of burning down the old cavaliers uninhabited house merely for the fun or the spite of the thing now she says if you will promise to set fire to thc sticks a thing which she could not do why we dont clearly see i will tell you a great secret in return for so important a service the youth readily perceiving that the old woman who had collected the faggots had not the power of putting a lighted match among them does as he is requested and sets fire to the pile  but there being some gunpowder in the vaults when enjoying the blaze they are both suddenly canted up into the air and blown into a thousand pieces so that though old woman was only just able when she fell down again to say how she carno by her misfortune and to tell the whole history over again which she had told in vain to the young man that was blown to sticks and then she died we have read many cartloads of novels in our time but such stuff as this we never met with before indeed it is difficult to conceive how any mau of ordinary capacity could sit down and deliberately commit to paper and print the pitiable trash before us it is scarcely possible to open these volumes at random without observing some example of extraordinary nonsense which is rendered the more offensive as it is put forth by the author with an air of infinite selfsatisfaction he thrusts a silly conceit on us as if he were presenting us with a gem of the finest water we take thc first sample of nonsense that occurs to us  when the sounds of trumpets and kettledrums gave notice that the procession was about to commence every street window cornice projection and housetop through which it was to pass became thickly studded with heads whose eager eyes gmttkium in thu sun looked like the countless dewdrops that hang upon the forest leaves as they sparkle in the first rays of morningvol ii p 21 it is a pretty bold flight to march a procession through windows cornices projections and housetops but that little blunder wre must set down to the account of our authors want of skill in grammar the other stroke is however a studied conceit and of matchless absurdity what mortal but mr horace smith would ever have thought of describing the eyes in peoples heads as glittering in the sun a child must perceive that this is sheer crazy nonsense and really the follies which this author commits to paper are of so very gross a kind as to astonish those who are unfortunately too well prepared for thc occurrence of foolishness in works of this order in one place he tells us that cromwell practised his troops in hardy exercises by encouraging them to throw pillows or cushions wc forget which at each others heads this is naked nonsense sometimes he disguises it in an abundance of words wc will give an example of this kind a young lady not mad is made to express herself thus on the subject of reciprocal love  reciprocal love must indeed sublimate the soul almost to an antepast of thc celestial beatitudes when the heart can find it sweet to make sacrifices and encounter perils for the object of its secret attachment even where it feels the passion to be unrequited nay even where it knows the affections of that object to be devoted to another the author goes on to say constantia had spoken with enthusiasm for she had been giving utterance to her own deep feelings she had pressed her hand upon ber heart for she had been converting its pulsations into language as we have so generally condemned this book wc cannot pass over any approximation to a merit that may be discovered in it and therefore we must not omit to say that there is one character in it that of bevcrning a dutch merchant which is drawn with some degree of cleverness but here we trace the besetting sin of thc author antithesis  his whole art of writing consists in setting up one thing and then counterbalancing it with another all his periods are seesaws bevcrning on this plan is made a man of the most opposite qualities isle is somewhat like one of sir jonah barringtons irish characters which are commonly thus seesawed liberal but mean cautious vet rash active but indolent fickle yet constant faithful but false c before we take leave of this book wc must entreat the author in his future productions not to make so unmerciful a use of the word egregious as he has done in these volumes egregious is incessantly occurring and is almost always improperly applied perhaps however this is intended for wit we know that drolls endeavour to raise a laugh by the eternal repetition and abuse of some one word,britain

  new novels checkmate a novel in three volumes by j sheridan le fanu hurst and blackett checkmate is a very well written novel of its kind and the mechanism of the plot is constructed with most wonderful ingenuity an illegitimate member of an old and wealthy family commits a murder of the thurtell type and then of course goes abroad where he meets with a skilful surgeon who cuts his face into a new shape thus disguised lie inherits a large fortune and returning to london appears upon the scene in the character of a thirdrate count of monte christo his energies and his wealth are however devoted to a most laudable object for we find him endeavouring by fair means or foul to marry a daughter of the house with which lie has a sinister connection and to restore the family to its original splendour by settling upon her the million or two of which he stands possessed the design is a meritorious one but in the execution of it the hero bungles dreadfully partly because he is rash enough to commit a second and absolutely unnecessary murder and partly because he employs as his agents several very low jew moneylenders at the very moment when his schemes seem most likely to succeed he is checkmated by the production of some most marvellous evidence as to the remodelling of his features which conclusively identifies him as an escaped assassin to be arrested for murder would indeed checkmate most men but the janus of mr lo fanu has the ingenuity to convert  checkmate into a stalemate by poisoning himself in prison and leaving his princely fortune to the lady upon whom in the most outrageously illegal manner he has been endeavouring to force his hand such a life i indeed  arduous and direful there is some ingenuity or rather novelty in the notion which is the hinge of mr lc fanus plot of  criminal who baffles the detective police by submitting to the taliacotian operation and the various crimes with which the story brims over are certainly very skilfully manipulated but we have at present far too many novels of this kind and are hardly disposed to welcome another very heartily however well it may be written or however ingeniously constructed no matter how skilfully the l newgate calendar  may be dressed up it remains the  newgate calendar after all novels nf this stamp are interesting no doubt in a certain sense  but such merit as they have is even at its best of alow order dumas is facile princeps in his school and the  count of monte christo is a masterpiece which no one need regret to have read once the same can hardly be said of dumas other works and it certainly cannot be said of the productions of our english school of melodramatic novelists anyone who has read twenty such novels as checkmate has contrived to waste a very great deal of time which might easily have been better spent even if such reading does no harm it certainly does no good and it would seem as if the taste for this highlyflavoured kind of fiction like the taste for opium and for drams grows with indulgence mr le fanu shows undoubted ability and it is a pity that he should not exercise it in i higher field the labour involved in halfadozen such melodramas as  checkmate  might produce one work which could be read not only with interest but with pleasure and even with profit for the present we have had enough and more than enough of murder bigamy forgery and so forth and it is almost time that a good writeras mr le fanu isshould essay something a little less transpontine life is or ought to be the province of the novelist and life consists of something more than a perpetual attempt to evade the grasp of a detective officer,britain

far from thc madding crowd by thomas hardy london smith elder  co 1874 far from the madding crowd is so clever a novel so original in atmosphere and in character that its brilliant qualities are likely to neutralise the glare of its equally prominent faults the writer has the advantage of dealing with an almost untouched side of english life his scene is laid somewhere in the country of mr freemans favourite seaxsaetas in a remote agricultural and pastoral district of southwestern england among peasants who look on bath as a distant and splendid metropolis it is likely that much of the old country existence lives on undisturbed the country folk in the story have not heard of strikes or of mr arch they have to all appearance plenty to eat and warm clothes to wear and when the sheep are shorn in the ancient barn of weatherbury the scene is one that shakespeare or that chaucer might have watched this immobile rural existence is what the novelist has to paint  in comparison with cities he says weatherbury was immutable the citizens then is the rustics now in london twenty or thirty years ago are old times in paris ten years or five in weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present and nothing hiss than a century set a mark on its face or tone five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter the embroidery of a smockfrock by the breadth of a hair ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase in these nooks the busy out aiders ancient times are only old his old times are still new his present is futurity no condition of society could supply though writer who knows it well with a more promising ground for his story the old and the new must meet here and there with curious surprises and our world may find itself face to face with the quaint conceited rustics of shakespeares plays such a story might be written as george sand has often told of the vallee noire sober characters and simple might appear in the foreground of scenes exquisitely quiet and harmonious in our opinion the writer of far from the madding crowd has only partially succeeded in making the best of his theme and though his failure is more valuable than i many successes he has been misled by attempting too much in his way of looking at his subject he rather resembles george eliot than george sand he contemplates his shepherds and rural people with the eye of a philosopher who understands all about them though he is not of them and who can express their dim efforts at rendering what they think and feel in language like that of mr herbert spencer it is this way of writing and thinking that gives though book its peculiar tone the author is telling clever people about unlettered people and he adopts a sort of patronising voice in which there are echoes now of george eliot and now of george meredith thus there aro passages where the manner and the matter jar and are out of keeping there are three circles of interest in this storyfirst the rural surroundings the effects of weather and atmosphere the labours of beasts and men as the lambing of sheep and such mild struggles with natures storms and rains as m victor hugo would scarcely find dramatic enough for his tremendous canvas next there are the minor charactersa sort of chorus of agricultural labourers very ready with advice very helpless and very much taken up with themselves as was the way with the ancient chorus last there are the main persons of the dramathe people in whose passions and adventures the interest ought to centre of these three component parts of the tale the first may bo pronounced nearly perfect and worthy of all praise we might instance the description of norcombe hill by starlight in the beginning of the second chapter as an original and admirable treatment of natureof nature which is more and more tending to become a main interest in our modern fiction we prefer to quote the enumeration of the signs by which the hero detected the approach of a storm because the quotation includes the sheep whose birth and death in this tale are narrated with great minuteness  the sheep were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes and the first peculiarity observable was that on the sudden appearance of oaks head over the fence they did not stir or run away they had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man but this was not the most noteworthy feature they were all grouped in such a way that their tails without a single exception were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened there was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar to which thc clump of furze bushes stood in the relation of the wearers neck  this was enough to reestablish him in his previous opinion he knew now that he was right and troy was wrong every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change but two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions apparently there was to be a thunderstorm and afterwards a cold continuous rain the creeping things seemed to know all about the latter rain but little of the interpolated thunderstorm while the sheep knew all about the thunderstorm and nothing of the latter rain when the thunderstorm bursts it is described with much pictorial effect and is a quite disagreeable enough trial to oak the english gilliat and contender with nature coming from though scenery to the chorus we are a good deal puzzled few men know the agricultural labourer at home and it is possible that ho is what mr hardy describes him the labourers are all humourists in their way which is a very dreary and depressing way odd scraps of a kind of rural euphuism misapplications of scripture and fragments of modern mechanical wit are stirred up into a queer mixture which makes the talk of henery fray cainy ball jan coggan and especially of that preeminent bore joseph poorgrass do labourers really converse like this  i look round upon life quite promiscous do you conceive me neighbours  my words though made as simple as i can nmy be rather deep tor some heads   oh yes henery we quite conceive ye  a strange old piece goodmenwhirled about from here to yonder as if i were nothing worth a little warped too but i have my depths ha and even my great depths i might close with a certain shepherd brain to brain but no oh no hero is another specimen of rural speech   for a drunk of really a noble class and on the highest principles that brought you no nearer to the dark man than you were afore you began there was none like these in farmer everdenes kitchen not a single damn allowed no not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there would have been a great relief to a merry soul   true said the maltster  nature requires her swearing at the regular times or shes not herself and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life and so on shepherds may talk in this way we hope not but if they do it is a revelation and if they dont it is nonsense and not very amusing nonsense leaving the servants and coming to their master and mistress we cannot say that wo are greatly fascinated with the persons or much concerned in their fortunes nothing could be more true or more careful than the study of troy the handsome sergeant with his half education his selfishness his love which he only finds out to be something like true love under the influence of remorse when the soldier erects a costly tomb to the woman whose heart he has broken and plants flowers on her grave in such a way as to wound to the quick the woman he has married we recognise an insight and a touch like that of flaubert but we cannot easily pardon bathsheba the heroine for losing her heart to troys flattery and to the glitter of his brass and scarlet indeed we have some difficulty in being much moved by bathshebas character and mischances when wo first see her she is stealing a look at herself in a mirror unconscious of the presence of young farmer oak when she hears that oak has asked her aunt for leave to court her and has been discouraged she runs after the exemplary man and explains that she is heart free then she sends a valentine with a seal marry me to farmer boldwood and so fascinates that apparently calm but really passionate rustic meanwhile oak fails as a farmer and bathsheba having become a farmer in ber own right takes him on as shepherd and has  curiously confidential passages with him at last the gay sergeant fixes her fancy with a display of swordsmanship and sho drives alone at night to bath and is married to him we feel inclined to say to her as mr buckstone does to galatea in the play  youre sure its innocence   the young ladys misfortunes deepen as troy spends her money and takes to drinking thero is a very powerful and strange scene between them when she opens the coffin of her dead rival fanny robin and her husband kisses the lips of the corpse and tells his wife that he only loved the dead it is a situation worthy of the drama of webster or of ford and wild as it is is lcd up to in a perfectly natural way this part of the tale including fanny robins terrible walk to her rest in the workhouse is ominently tragic and is not improved by the commonplace tragedy of the denouement we leave bathsheba wedded to the worthy oak a capital overseer and a husband who may be trusted we hope the babies were  put in the papers every man jack of them as mr oak promised when ho wooed bathsheba is so seldom on though level that her troubles with her husband raise her to that wc feel she does not decline on oak and have no sense of her as wasting her sweetness it is unlikely that even her remorso for having tempted boldwood would lead her into her foolish latter relations with such a man and on the whole we cannot look on bathsheba as a firmly designed character in spite of this want of success and of incongruities of tone tyar from the madding crowd displays undeniable talent which has scarcely as yet found its best and easiest and most natural expression in taking leave of an interesting provoking and clever story we must say a word in praise of though graceful illustrations a lang  far from the maddlng crowd far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy author of  a pair of blue eyes smith elder and co without making minute comparisons between mr hardy and any of his contemporary novelists let it suffice to say that this last work of his at once lifts his name above the crowd and gives him a position among the eminent few which it rests with himself to confirm or to diminish mr hardy is not a novelist to whom the exercise of his art is a bywork or a recreation it is clear that he has given his best energies to its service and has worked with faithful and patient zeal for his reward it is pleasing to meet with work that is so obviously the outcome of high aims and one should not be grudging in expressing ones conviction of the artists thorough success far from the madding crowd is not mr hardys first novel but it is so much more mature and powerful in every way than his earlier efforts that in them he seems rather to have been exercising himself with a view to obtaining a command of his materials this is particularly true of under the greenwood tree published some two years ago which the author called  a rural painting of the dutch school and in which he depicted rural life in an english county with the most loving minuteness and intimate fidelity of detail  a pair of blue eyes mr hardys next effort was not so exclusively pictorial it was a study of a more tragic kind with more complex characters and a more stirring plot but the evolution was none the less deliberate and every situation was worked out with the same painstaking and searching method both under the greenwood tree and a pair of blue eyes are very remarkable novels which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation and pictorial and narrative power of the writer but far from the madding crowd is not only an advance upon them in freedom and firmness of handling but it excels them also in concentration of interest and in spacious breadth and solid truth of proportion when the first chapters of  far from the madding crowd appeared in the cornthill magazbine a supposition was started that this must be a new novel by george eliot and the point was very generally discussed indeed if those chapters stood by themselves as a fragment of unknown authorship no conjecture could be more plausible they deal with the kind of life that george eliot has more than once chosen to describe to which in fact she has almost acquired a prescriptive right and the opening description of farmer oak is a portrait very much in her manner if the critic cared to go into minute corroborations of such distinguished parentage he would find them in the incidents of bathshebas unpacking the mirror and taking a survey of her beauty while waiting on the top of the cart and her higgling over twopence with the tollkeeper these little incidents have a delicate spice of malicious truth to nature which one often finds in george eliots pictures at the same time if we had read mr hardys previous novels we need have had no difficulty in tracing the authorship of  far from the madding crowd for mr hardys style is his own and sufficiently distinctive to be easily recognised one might mistake a detached portion of his work for george eliots but when it is viewed as a whole it has a good many striking points of difference mr hardy is not such a master of language as george eliot his style has not the same freshness nor the same eloquence and momentum and this difference of style goes along with a more deeplyseated difference of matter mr hardy is much less of a preacher than george eliot his interests are more exclusively dramatic he is absorbed in delineating character and tracing the workings of passion by minute touches and does not withdraw from his dramatic work to deliver his soul of pentup reflections with all george eliots impartiality towards her creations and her desire to represent each ones life truly as it is nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice the heart of the preacher is to be detected in her choice of subjects her characters derive a large part of their interest from their opinions and views of life now the drama in mr hardys novels is in no sense a warfare of opinions or ideas it is a warfare of persons persons moved by the primaeval motives of love and jealousy far from the madding crowd is concerned with no deeper mysteries than womens hearts and how they are lost and won its story lies in country fields and farmhouses and occupies itself solely with the secular and social life of the inhabitants whether we regard this as a merit or a defect or a matter of indifference depends entirely on our conceptions of art and its functions but if we hold no dogma concern  ing the functions of art and approach mr hardys novel simply as a drama willing to believe that it need not be frivolous because it has no great lesson to teach it is impossible not to recognise the novelists power the plot of far from the madding crowd is of the simplest kind mr hardys art does not lie in the multiplication and complication of incidents but in the searching and complete way in which he traces the effect of each incident upon the thoughts and feelings of his personages the central figure all through is bathsheba everdenea marvellously welldrawn and difficult heroine who unites ha iunlits of her biblical namesake to an inner nature  is     i ius maut vl inne fak curiously compounded of shrewdness strongmined irankness and courage and decorous imperious wayward womanliness the two little incidents that occur on her first introduction to us her satisfied selfinspection in the mirror and her obstinate refusal to give the toilkeeper what he askedat once give us the clue to two sides of her character the novel may be viewed as a history of a struggle between impulsive womanliness and worldly good sense all bathshebas troubles coming from her beauty and consequent waywardness and vanity and the rectification coming from the homelier side when we first see her she is on her way to live with an aunt in whose neighbourhood lives a shepherd farmer named gabriel oak oak was a sturdy capable fellow neither ugly nor particularly welllooking who had raised himself by thrift sobriety and superior knowledge of his work from being a common shepherd to having a farm of his own he naturally fell in love with bathsheba and the account of h1i drein before going througlh the momentous ceremony of making a formiial proposal for her hand will give an il1ca of the diflicultv the

  esther waters esther waters is not the turning point in mr george moores literary career in several recent utterances it might have been read that the turning point was reached some time ago that he had worked out his old inspirations or was getting such new light on them as would transfuse them into something new only till now he has had no prominent opportunity of showing the changes in his aims or in his expression of these esther waters will then stand to mark the place where he turned off and sought other things than of old not that he has forsworn all his former methods or his former self but these are made to subserve the impulsive dominating force of the new spirit what mr moore set out to do in this story was to relate the life and adventures of a poor little kitchenmaid whom an unkind fate forced into the household of a racing betting squire and afterwards cast adrift on london in poverty and loneliness the circumstances of such a history are suggestive enough of ugliness meanness and vulgarity and mr moore it must be said has not heretofore been slow to make use of such opportunities well  esther waters  is not an idyll exactly but plunging boldly into the harsh unclean tawdry cruel life of london squalor of racecourse and publichouse glitter he has drawn up the essential reality and behold there is nothing in it alien to heroism of sturdy growth and purity that is inherent honesty courage and wholesome sweetness are hardy blossoms that stand and endure and bloom in poisonous air  esther waters the most vigorous denunciation of gambling that ever was written has been laid it is said under some kind of modified taboo it would be well to discuss this point of view if one could bring ones self to understand it it is easier to conceive of its striking readers as showing a moral purpose far too insistently from beginning to end it is pervaded by a sense of the everlasting usefulness and beauty of moral effort but though the purpose is always evident and near the surface mr moore has reached his particular result mostly by a refining and a ripening of his artistic perceptions the heaping up of detail and circumstance the pride in gathering all the material possible for scenebuilding the photographic method of  include everything as it comesit must be right if its there was an interesting stage in modern fiction accepted by some as a final artistic inspiration while as a matter of fact it was only science putting its spoke in begging art to take life seriously and look it in the face without fear half the behest was based on a complete misunderstanding of the temperament and the uses of art the other half was intelligent but the whole was obeyed for a time with conscientious literalness art is now recovering a sense of its own essential differences and conditions but it has retained a respect for common life and the understanding that such life can be used for artistic purposes mr moore has gone through the discipline he keeps the habit of minute observation some of the old pride in lack of fastidiousness and a belief in the uses of the camera but these he is not mastered by now  esther waters  is a democratic novel through it there breathe not only sympathy with life at its hardest but a hearty and altogether unpatronising respect for the strugglers mr moore exaggerates just as little as he idealises you see no giant tyrant consistently threatening and opposing and killing help friendliness kindliness are lights that stream into betting holes and burn down area steps and amid squalor and low aims for all his french sympathies mr moore has read the english heart aright he has seen the springs that keep it wholesome divined the consolations that keep it from being altogether debased the emotional protestantism of the little sects that gather into their narrow folds so much fervour and tender passion is shown as a living force and not only without cynicism but without patronage  i esther waters by george moare w scott and co there is little of beauty in circumstance or setting mr moore is wonderfully sparing of prettiness indeed his hand is a hard one in only a few passages does the beauty of the world shine through and this is one of them esther has been taken into kent to make friends with the relatives of her lover fred the religious stationer fred was on a ladder shaking the branches but he came down when he saw esther and harry his brother took his place esther and fred filled one basket then yielding to a mutual inclination they wandered about the orchard stopping on the little plank bridge they hardly spoke at all words seemed unnecessary each felt happiness to be in the others presence they heard the water trickling through the weeds and as the light waned the sound of the falling apples grew more distinct then a breeze shivered among the tops of the apple trees and the sered leaves were blown from the branches the voices of the gatherers were heard crying that their baskets were full they crossed the plank bridge joking the lovers who stood aside to let them pass a red moon rose behind the hillside into a dark leaden sky when they entered the house they saw the old farmer who had slipped in before them sitting by his wife holding her hand patting it in a curious oldtime way this is a glimpse as rare to the reader as it was to esther she did not marry fred after all a life with him was the brightest prospect she had ever had but duty with its roots in the past seemed to point away from the paths of comfort and even of strict morality  one doesnt do the good that one would like to in the world one has to do the good that comes to one to do this is esthers philosophy not a bad one faithfully adhered to to be in keeping with his subject mr moore has adopted a very plain diction he has held himself in there is nothing grandiloquent either in sentiment or expression there is no fine writirg at allto tell the truth there is a good deal of uncommonly poor writing but blunders and carelessness apart it is artistic in its methods and its tone it is painstaking plain and detailed like the life it paints there are shorter ways for poets and a poet mr moore is not but poetry after all while making us realise the misery and the heroism as a whole might have obscured what he particularly desired to showthe daily buffetings hourly

sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in such a state as to admit of philological guesses but folktales and not philology are the scope of mr wratislaws interesting and useful book which we feel sure will be heartily welcomed bv all folklorists as it is the fashion to call them w r morftxl,britain
the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the time watched by three brahmin priests in disguise at the taking of seringapatam john hernoastle an english officer is met by one of his relations at the treasury of the palace and under rather suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for which he exacts a remarkable vengeance he leaves to his niece rachel verinder lady verinders only daughter the diamond and itis taken out of the bank in london where it was deposited for safe custody that it may be presented to rachel on her birthiday by her cousin franklin blake franklin atrives at the house in the absence of his aunt and cousin and hearing that three indian jugglers have been seen about the place he starts for the neighbouring town a few miles off and deposits the moonstone with a banker there by the time the birthday iarrives rachel has refused another cousin godfrey ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them sergeant cuff an eminent detective is brought down friud london but rachel refuses to give him any information and strange to say she completely onto her old lover and will hold no communication with him sergeant cuffs suspicions point to rachel herself he thinks that she has used the diamond for the purpose of raising motey to pat her debts and thae she has been aided by rosanna spearman one of the servants a deformed girl who had been brought up as a thief and whom lady verinder had received from a reformatory xnny circumstances point to rosainna as the guilty person the newlypainted door leading to rachels sittingroom has bean smeared and the smear must have been made by thi thiin the night clothing of all the servante is found eorredt but rosanna is known to have purchased sode cloth at the vtiaseand to have been engaged in her own room making aomethi in addition the detective discover that she bhs bought a tin box and chain and sinks them i the shivering sads on th coast and not

mysterj unexplained in time however all is cleared up a oommunicative assistant to a country doctor had whilst his master wine delirious taken down his ravings and got at the fact that one of the gentlemen at the birthday dinnerpartywe will not disclose the authors secret by saying whowas drugged with opium the assistant is of opinion and finds his view fortified by a passage from carpenters

tried in the presence of witnesses and a sham diaeod is tva in the same way that the real one had been but be d affording some proof not very strong that the suspeted indivml was not a thief the meas adopted are rsultflss as the sleoini drops the piece of glass upon the floor and sinks off to shop rachels solicitor andl friend 3fr bruff however has good reason for suspecting that the diamond has been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old steward had less to say about robinson crusoe miss clacks narrative is intended to convey the idea of a meddlesome fanatic but it is merely a broad burlesque of the character,britain
godl and the king by marjorie bowen methuen and i co 6s with  god and the king  miss marjorie bowen has now completed the third and last volume dealing with william of orange the passage of history chosen in the present instance is the time of williams sovereignty over the english people and probably because of the more prosaic nature of the period the story lacks something of the glamour of the stirring times in  i will maintain when the young prince was fighting and overcoming all obstacles in his endeavour to save his country williams love for and devotion to his wife are brought out very strongly in the book as is also his great grief at her death there is always a certain feeling of sadness in reading about the declining years of a mans life especially so when those years are lonely and spent amid surroundings which are in no way congenial as was the case with william iii for he was not a popular monarch miss bowen has expended a good deal of earnest thought upon the characters in her trilogy and together they show the result of painstaking and indefatigable labour  god and the king by marjorie bowen methuen  co this book completes miss bowens trilogy dealing with the life of william of orange  and it is worthy of note that the last volume sustains if it does not surpass the interest of the previous parts in this william is shown amid the intrigues which subsequently placed him on the throne of england and his life as king is also included in the sketch the canvas is full and vivid it is as we have had occasion to remark before almost as a piece of history and not as a novel that we read miss bowens work she has an eager admiration for her hero yet she paints him once again with all his defects if this be not the real stadtholder it is as flood a portrait as we are likely to get so too whether authentic or not the character of sunderland is graphically realized indeed the gallery of portraits is large and brilliant perhaps the best scenecer tainly the most ambitious in its subdued emotionalismis that which pictures the death of the queen and the collapse of the king miss bowen makes the reader feel throughout sympathy and admiration for william rather than affection and she is justified by history we congratulate her on a fine achievement,britain

the old and the young bv luizi pirandello trans lated by c k scott moncrieff 2 vols 155 chatto  windus this long novel of pirandellos is surely one of the loosest least amenable works of fiction written since victor hugo died it has extraordinary merits its mere range is undeniably impressive but it has long p 3sages of boredom passages which are almost journalistic so topical are they in their appeal and occasional lapses into a melodrama hardly excused by the books subject it is a novel of sicily in 1892 when there was a rising in tha island which had not benefited as it hoped from the victory of the risorgimento pirandellos sympathies are racial rather than politicaland the nonitalian reader will gather little from the book except a conviction that the whole life of rome and the provinces was thick with bribery and corruption there is an astonishing collection of characters in the storyfrom the bishop to the wild old body servant from the eccentric archaeologist to the ardent politician from the greedy capitalist to the unbalanced overseer of the sulphur mines in the dreadful scene when the overseer and his mistress are killed by the strikers the novel reaches a really impassioned height of feeling and in the scene between the old statesman and his young wife pirandello reminds us of the deep pity that his plays can arouse in the portrait of robert arvisti he has achieved a little masterpiece in the portrayal of weakness masked as strength and in that of lando lauretano an admirable picture of the path of the idealist in politics the translation is as consummately done as all mr scott moncrieffs but we hope his occupation with stendhal and pirandello does not mean that he has abandoned his task of interpreting proust,britain

sons and lovers by d h lawrence duckworth and co 6s a strange book this full of haunting memories which perhaps if not entirely successful must yet be welcomed as an achievement it was evident from the authors first book the white peacock that here was a writer who not only had something to say but who was gifted with an unusual sensitiveness and receptiveness of sympathy and observation sons and lovers confirms the impression it is full of good things full of charm full of truthful delineations of character if a little rambling a little overlong a little meticulous in unnecessary detail there is a sentence in the book which would seem rather apposite in these days in a conversation between the man and the woman he loves she says so a man can give au himself to a work whereas a woman can only give the unimportant part of herself if it is true she says it is a great shame the book in a way is built round that theme the woman whom the man loves and who passionately loves him he does not marry when finally he asks her whether she will have him to marry and she asks him whether he really wants to he replies not much it is the end the work of life to him is more than its illusions it is in little flashes like this that lawrence excels but the book has much more in it than this the descriptions of mining life the study of the rough rather sodden father and that of the refined and sensitive mother above her station in life is a remarkable piece of writing all through the characters are most carefully thought out and distinctively edged in so much so that one has to read the book very carefully to grasp its charm and truthfulness which is one of the great qualities of mr lawrences work then again there is great beauty of expression a wonderful sympathy with nature and flowers and the hidden springs of humanity and a fine understanding of the lives of these mining people he depicts this is certainly a book which stands out far above the ordinary novel it brings the authors reputation very high it makes one think that mr lawrence is going to be a great writer as it is of all the young writers he is quite the most promising  i sons and lovers by d h lawrence duck worth and co 6s in this book mr lawrence has given us a very curious study and at the same time one that is far from pleasant we are introduced at the outset to mrs morel as a central figure and through her are made to realise the inner life of her son paul who later on takes the centre of the stage and struts uglily in company with two women between whom he wavers he is unable to love either and apparently the only love of which he is capable is that for his mother for her death leaves him derelict these are humble people for pauls father was a collier and paul himself was a clerk in a surgical appliance factory though he evinced a capacity for the arts in that he painted at times the author renders these things with such clearness that we believe in them and feel the characters of the book as real persons we feel too that mr lawrence strips everything naked there is no delicacy nor reticence about his work but he probes and searches and analyses in ruthless surgical fashion finding never a bit of soul but sense and passion and brutality and cruelty evidently he has found life a very bitter ugly thing with no joy in it nor any warmth but the warmth of lust his people are animalshighly developed it is trueand very fine mentally but throughout all the book there is no glimpse of spiritpaul and the circle of people among whom he moves live by sense and sense alone the only fine quality in the work is mother love the rest is naked ugliness on the whole it is a very fine study of the cruelty of life and very depressing in its effect,britain

husbands pair off as a matter of course with other peoples wives but they do not even take the same trains as their lawful partners moreover the food and the pictures and other luxuries of a decadent civilization are all to be found of the very best at this smartly unconventional establishment poor  mr james the dramatic character evidently not being wholly at home in such a smart set is naturally somewhat impressed and rather shy at the prospect before him but he very sensibly determines to make the most of a unique occasion by going about with a mental not ebook and an inquiring disposition  and he does not lose an instant j in beginning for at the station he sees a mr long whom he had once or twice before met at the same house but who had always hitherto consistently cut him at other places this gentleman he had consequently put down as a fool but on this occasion long recognises him with some warmth and the change is so remarkable and surprising to  mr james that he immediately assumes that long has become quite intelligent and devotes his inquiring mind through the rest of the book to trying to find out how such a change has come about he has not arrived at the end of his train journey before he has elaborated a theory in collaboration with a mrs brissenden who of course is travelling down without her husband and who in the wellknown way of smart poople habitually calls this husband  poor briss the theory shadowy as it is seems to be the chief point of these pages so we shall leave anybody who is sufficiently interested to find it out for himself to find confirmation for it 44mr james has a merry time of it with all the other characters of the book he goes about button  holing all the men generally opening with my dear man to show his intimate knowledge of polite society and even the ladies of the party have an occasional my dear woman tossed to them he does not impart to any of them his theoryhe is far too subtle for thatbut he tries to lead them by the most terribly long  winded conversations into admissions of a position of which they are supremely unconscious to do them justice most of his interlocutors are supremely bored by liim and have very little scruple in telling him so  you cant be a providence and not be a bore says one of the good women plainly enough to him but if his interlocutors are bored what must his readers be  for not content with writing out all these subtly incoherent conversations at length he sometimes interrupts them for four or five pages on end to explain the portentous signification which his imagination sees in a droop of the lips or a movement of the hand the book ends up with a conversation of about one hundred pages with mrs brissenden it takes place in the drawingroom after twelve when most of the ladies have gone to bed and the servants have been squared another subtle and characteristic touch of smart society to leave the lights on as a result of this terribly improper conference in the full blaze of the electric light it appears that not only is mr jamess  theory incorrect anyhow but that it is absolutely gratuitous as the fact which it should have explained is not a fact for long turns out to be as great an ass as ever the whole book is an example of hypochondriacal subtlety run mad the characters in the book are simple stupid english people direct and comparatively uninteresting and  mr james becomes simply a bore besides being vulgar in his absurd attempt to read into them subtle conditions of soul of which they are totally incapable  fiction the sacred fount by henry james heinemann 6s had anyone but mr james written this book his admirers might well have cried  oh tis sacrilege but since mr james himself is the author what can we say but that he has in his own brilliantly tedious way with his own inimitable art and with his own occult knowledge of what the lifting of an eyebrow or the movement of a back may meansucceeded triumphantly in an elaborate satire on himselfthat is on his own obsession  everybody knows what mr jamess obsession is and after achieving the last page of this volume it is evident to us that mr james also knows with him as with the character without a name who tells the story the vision of life is an obsession to him for real excitement  there are no such adventures as the intellectual ones  in every word or action of his fellowcreatures he perceives motives that like the lines on a railway siding have no beginning and no end mr james has never carried his analysis of the daintily unimportant further than in the sacred fount and never before to our knowledge has he after incredible labour with bricks of gossamer and mortar of sunbeams blown down the dainty edifice with such a goodhumoured series of puffs the last page brings a vision of mr henry james stepping forward and saying with a profound obeisance   you perceive how prodigiously i know myself the sacred fount we may say without more ado is youth the theme of the book is the hypothesis that youth has the power to rejuvenate and vivify age but at the cost of the oozing away of the sap of youth from itself but mr james is not a believer in his own theory or only to a certain extent he turns tail he allows his speculations to be derided and the end is more smoke than fire or perhaps it would be fairer to say that he uses his hypothesis merely as a means of showing to what prodigious lengths the analytical mind can go it is as if the princess in the fairy tale from the suggestion of the presence of the pea beneath her mattress had created a market garden of flowering shrubs the pea represents the cell from which mr james as master nurseryman has produced his garden of exotics a day and an evening cover the period of the story which passes at newmarch a country house of liberal ease and delightful appurtenances there a few choice guests are gathered among them is the narrator with his passion for embroidering on things and his genius for seeing a hundred complex reasons behind a cursory remark or a chance movement the way you get hold of things says mrs brissenden sometimes she is called mrs briss  is positively uncanny it is here is an example of just how much the nameless narrator we must restrain ourselves from the temptation of identifying him with mr james sees in a glance something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to hi in at the house he had met his wife she had in 8 me way dealt with him he had beeu with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him we have not space to quote the many things this rontgenrayeyed guest saw in mrs brissendens back but we can assure the reader that a page of the book does not cover them his awakening is due to mrs brissenden she patiently refuses to play the part of a pretty fly refuses to walk into the parlour to put a pretty copingstone to his palace of gossamer instead she fires her bright artillery at him and the concussion shakes down the palace of gossamer he has been elaborating his theories at infinite length and her comments are   how can i tell please what you consider youre talking about    you see too much    you talk too much    you overestimate the penetration of others     youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build upyou build up houses of cards are we extravagant in suggesting that this is mr henry james in a grimly humorous mood turning his analytical mind on himself the skill of the story is enormous  the triumph of its artistic presentment is indisputable only mr james could have written it so much we grant willingly but since an authors power of being able to interest his reader in his story as story must depend on the temperament and predilection of the reader we will give our personal verdict by slightly modifying one of mr jamess own locutions the narrator in the pause that follows some remarks he has made to mrs brissenden thus soliloquises oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it we would saythe transposition is slight oh how intensely we didnt like having to read our way to the very end of the sacred fount if mr james hadnt so handsomely put into it all his delicate talent and thus illumined the tediousness of the story we should not only have made a wry face but yawned ourselves away to the company ofwell of john silver or captain kettle,britain

delineation of character if a drama an inartificial plot or an epie a stupid story if an essay it may be dull if history confused but still he will be sure to say much that is worth reading and to set

they never wasted force nor lost irreparable time professor aytoun is undeniably a clever inan a wan of masculine understanding with a close gtrip on his su1aject a man of thought learning patience

into nothing better than threadbare cant but however manly in intention and expression a political novel is a tremendous venture and needs the most lelicate treatment nothing less than the wit of disraeli or the eloquence of bulwer can make it palatable and in professor aytouns hands it becomes simply a ore unredeemod and irredeemable no smart descriptions of parties or brilliant links of interest forged between principles and passions sentiments and charactersno clever intertwining of polities and plotso that the one helps to elucidate the other and neither can be taken away without the whole thing collapsing the professor who writes of n orman sinclair knows nothing of these higher flights of his craft and his work suffers in consequence it has no intellectual life very little romance and quite as little human interest and yet it is a clever book and the book of a strongheaded man who has however in this instance run his head against a walland a thick one tooand has only

a lifts secret by mrs henry wood 2 vols wood whitten six years since for though pages of a serial this story of love amongst the rich and strikes amongst the poor is now for the first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living novelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a novelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no good puri posethe very thing which she wishes us to think that she has left undone,britain
the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to us we have seen the silken courtiers to whom these people are as dogs bound by no ties of love among themselves the marquis bas left the reception room of monseigneur devoting him to the devil he has run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always the same with you people he cannot pay something   he has paid all monseigneur he is dead  well he is quiet can i restore him to you   alas no monseigneur  but he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass well  monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass again well she looked an old woman but was young her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  monseigneur hear me monseigneur hear my petition my husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want again wen can i feed themt u monseigneur the good god knows but i dont ask it my petition is that a morsel of stone or wood with my husband name may  be placed over him to show where he lies otherwise the place will  be quickly forgotten it will never be found when i am dead of the  same malady i shall be laid undw some other heap of poor grass i monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much  want monseigneur monseigneur j the valet had put ber away from the door the carriage had broken n into a bruk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left fg far behind and monseigneur again escorted by the furies was rapidly  diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau i  distinctly present to the taney of the writer must have 11 g ly  been that scene of the taking of the bastille which is here is j made present to the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to the story of doctor manette as to the history of france here again is a little picture of saint antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sance to wretched bread  yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarges wineshop parted with its  last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door  at last it is come my dear f eh well returned madame  almost how admirable is the picture of the rise of power io the doctor when the day comes that makes the great horror of his life a means of blessing to his child by giving him influence as a bastille prisoner over the storm that threatens shipwreck of her dearest hopes he relapses when a second wave against which all bis skill is powerless breaks over her head aud the knot is at last solved by sydney cartou the exquisite poetry of the touches which detail to us j the manner of his sacrifice with the honour and trust  of an innocent girl to strengthen him in his last moment is worthy to be the close of a tale nobly sustained to the latest word a few touches here and there may be in excess  we are hardly content for example that it should occur to miss pros at a critical moment to compare madame defarge s eyes to bed winches  but

to the lighthouse by virginia woolf 7s 6d hogarth press we hope that all the readers who were troubled and confused by jacobs room saddened and even a little confused by mrs dalloway will read  to the lighthouse for here they will be neither troubled nor confused and if they are saddened their sadness will be filled with beauty we hope too that all who care for english literature but have somehow missed her other works will read this mrs woolfs masterpiece and appreciate one of the most subtle and sensitive minds now expressing itself in the novel mrs woolfs prose is written in the mood of poetry she is intensely interested in the outsides of things but only as they express the inner beauty the hidden reality of the mystery we call life she has never tried to reach her goal by easy or pedestrian methods her steed has always been pegasus winged and fiery springing toward cloudcapped towers she has tried to rule him in her own way and has not always succeeded sometimes he has escaped with her where we could not follow sometimes she has missed her goal but here she has mastered him her book is a poem in prose her difficult method which shows us life through the minds of her charactersthose minds in which emotion and thought are for ever blending changing with every impression of the senses and changing those impressions to feelings and ideasno longer seems to distort life but to show it more intensely and clearly like a landscape seen through the diminishing glass of a painter  to the lighthouse is a study in the reactions of one temperament on another the ebb and flow of feelings especially of the feelings of her family and friends to mrs ramsay the beautiful the masterful the loving mrs ramsay who is like a natural force almost a personification of the beauty the strange persuasion the broken comfort of what we call  nature it is a study in the difficulties of love of friendship beauty informs this book as the sunlight informs a summers day as a reflection  fills the river with the green hillside  fiction to the lighthouse by virgina woolf hogarth press 7s 6d in observation and mastery of prose mrs woolf ranks very high she could be among our foremost novelists but she prefers to exploit a theory of writing which leaves her story nowhere important incidents being summarised in brackets as if they were a tedious necessity the lighthouse which provides the title is the aim of a trip by sea which attracts the ramsay family it is proposed put off and not achieved till the end of the book when mrs ramsay is dead her character is a fine achievement at fifty with hollow cheeks and white hair she is still beautiful stll strangely attractive and round her revolve various persons including her husband a mooning professor blind to ordinary things and in spite of his egoism inspiring pity and gratitude in his wife she looks after the shabby seaside house and their host of children the important moments of the book come in obscure broken hints attempts to recapture the meaning which for no reason at all as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or ringing a doorbell descends on people making them symbolical making them representative  this transcendence of symbols is pictured in a deliberately interrupted style meant somehow to reproduce it,britain

folk tales of breffny by b hunt macmillan and i co 3s 6d net the story    bears greater resemblance to the work of a poet than to that of the popular novelist who is thebourgeois of literature states the introduction to this work whether male or female b hunt is as dogmatic as a suffragette but we incline to the opinion that the great novelists of englishand for that matter of other languages as wellwill bear with one who displaying none of the imagination which is lauded in this introduction sets down a portion of the folklore of cavan and leitrim adhering as far as possible to the original style of narration commonsense forbids us to agree with the author in that these stories must rank among the aristocracy of literature while fictioneven of the highest orderis set down somewhere between the professional and artisan classes to give books a species of human classification setting aside this emphatic utterance on the part of mr or more probably miss  b hunt we find the book very interesting several of the stories notably that of  the enchanted hare and in a less measure the kings daughter of france are reminiscent of the legends of other countries but the true celtic turn of mind is here and well expressed at that misswe conclude it is misshunt has given us a little work of sufficient value we should have thought to enable her to dispense with that vicious dig at the popular novelist  folc tales of breffny by b hunt macmillan 3s 6d net those who have an interest in the stuff at the back of literature and who like seeing that stuff firse taking shape in the intuitive imagination of simple men will value this book in its simplicity it has a quality so rare in both meanings of the word that it should occupy a permanent place on the shelf with the very few other books of its kind that exist the tales differ greatly in value some of them in fact taper away and just disappear with an inconsequence that defies the mind looking for a conclusion to things but that is part of their nature miss hunt had them told her by an old man who said he had more and better learning nor the scholars a breffny man from that part of connacht covered by county leitrim and a part of county sligo collateral tales to these will be familiar to those who have met similar men in other parts of connacht but miss hunt differs from others in that she has gone to the pains of putting them carefully down and as we judge trimming away the amplifications with the result that reading her pages in their wonderful naivete one comes closely into touch with a vivid imagination at work in a people living near the source of wonder purging itself through centuries of renewed wonder the graphic drama of the telling is largely lost but that must needs be for the printed page will not compete in such matters with the kindling eye and the cadence of voice but what has been retained will if justly caught make the appetite more than a little impatient of problemnovels,britain
  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival,britain

the deud secret new hovels by wilkie collins 2 vols cranbury  vanswo injustice will be done to mr colling if we trace the outline of his story before estimating its qualities as a work of art  the dead secret is no secret to a numerous class of readers nor will it long remain a mystery to those who set out in search of it for the first time perhajw it is doubtful how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage becomes transparent in the opening chapters to all resent and to come therefore be it known that porthgenna tower with the premises adjoining is the tomb aud temple of n great family mystery captain and mrs trevertonthe former the lord of lands and monies the latter the daughter of an actress have there their local habitation  with them resides their only child rosamond mrs trevertons servant is called sarah leeson and in the first scene this woman is summoned to the deathbed of her mistress she is compelled by her domestic allegiance to write a letter to her master which the wife signs anil the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of porthgenna towera chamber lost amid labyrinths of corridors and suites in a neglected part of the building then afterother precautionary devices she vanishes and the place in cornwall knows her no more years elapse rosamond is married to a blind mr frankland her father captain treverton dies in the antiguan waters  she and her hatband determine to take possession of the mouldy timetinted tower of porthgenna including the wealthbestowing appurtenances of the treverton prc perty and they set out upon a journey to that deserted domain upon the road at a humble inn among strangers of every degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the

time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both

other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead

new issue of the dead secret in our literary summnzar last week  btit a niore detailed criticism is called for alike by the justly eminenit positwn of the author and the sterling character of the work itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

anna lombard by victoria cross  i see in victoria cross the possibilities of a future marie corelli so wrote the heady critic of a contemporary in reviewing an earlier story by the lady who writes under the penname of victoria cross in this volume the scena of which is laid in india she imagines herself to be a man i was youngnot yet thirty though sometimes possibly the result of much severe study my brain and nerve having seemed singularly old i had some five years before come out head of the list in the indian civil service examination as a child anna lombard so she told the herolady  had walked on the seabeaten sands repeating her lessons in the classics to the wild wet winds that were busy blowing the colour into her exquisite skin john long 6s  anna lombard by victoria cross long it is unfortunate that victoria cross has chosen to narrate this novel in the first person under the character of a man the fact is that victoria cross however much or little she may understand women has very little conception of a good mans characteristics  her hero is evidently meant to be admirable for his patient fidelity to the object of his love hut the fidelity is not comprehensible in a decent man when one considers the horrible creature anna lombard is represented to be and the fidelity is still less comprehensible when one realises the purely physical nature of his passion as becomes apparent from the selfrevelation of the man the fact is that the hero is a miserable edition of des grieux without even that poor creatures honesty and without his compensations anna lombards illregulated sensuality is disgusting and her deceitfulness is pitiful the author evidently means one to admire both her and her prurient lover but they are not admirable  still less are they consistent or probable people it is an inartistic book,britain
my ideated john bullesses as others see us by yoshio markino illus trated constable and co 6s net in his introduction mr markino is very indignant with some of the western people he is not content with being himself received as a very welcome guest in our country we must like and embrace his whole nation there must be no  west is west and east is east as he puts it and as for the idea of the  yellow peril he pathetically tells us that it hurts his heart he assures us that as a  little kid he could never get away from the portrait of an english girl given to his father by a dutch officer and hung in his childhoods home the men and women young and old rich and poor all of them worshipped this picture a criticism of this statement when it first appeared in the english review pointed out that it was a refutation of the theory held by professor karl pearson to the effect that the human instinct unconsciously obeys the law of  like to like  some socalled scientists stupefy people bitterly laments our japanese friend i have not read professor pearsons book yet and i shall never read it either for i hate reading books  i am so astonished that there are many people j who do nothing but follow after the theory of a few books which they have read and they ignore the true facts which are before their eyes thus speaks the artist and it is the chapters dealing with art and all appertaining to art that are the best in the book from the life spent by the children in kensington gardens our author passes on to the great love of sport inherent in english men and women it is not until we read a criticism of ourselves and our manners that we at all understand how very strange they may appear to a foreigner tradition and custom have so much to do with the characteristics of nations and individuals that it is quite good and even necessary to have a little kindly searchlight thrown on our habits now and again and the instrument in this case is handled in so gentle and steady a manner that the most sensitive and shrinking john bulless can be quite certain that the rays will not scorch or even make her blink when a lad in japan mr markinos idea of the english dance from a moral point of view was similar to that held by the two american missionaries who came to england a few years ago to  convert our backsliding people a fourteen years residence in the country of the john bullesses has convinced him that a ball is not a degrading but a healthy spectacle perhaps after a few more years spent in the fogs and mists of this western island he wfll emerge to the truth that the abolition or alteration of laws and  votes for women  will not do away with unkindness and crime and that it is sometimes necessary in the interests of the many to temper the help that might spontaneously be rendered to relieve the sufferings of the few mr markino thinks that the difference between the arts of the two nations england and japan shows clearly the differences of the two peoples that whereas the english study the effect a picture is going to present asa whole the japanese pay so much attention to each separate detail that the whole painting is often out of all reasonable proportion he carries this simile to account for the carelessness of some of his john bullesses friends with regard to their toilet our charming young friend has many privileges but he must be careful not all english women will confess to smearnig lampblack on a white lining to hide a bit unstitched or that they are held together in the region of the waist with  two dozen pins but he shows so sincere a heart in all he relates and is so joyful and happy with all his friends that we are quite certain that not one of them will like him a whit the less for putting them in his book both in the text and the dainty illustrations,britain

mmdlemarch  jfiddlemarch a study of provincial life by george eiiot in four volumev blackwood 1 many theresas have been born who found for them i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with t he meanness of opportunity perhaps a tragic failure f vhich found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion 1 with dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness for these laterborn t1cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other k oudemned as a lapse we need to recall those sentences in the prelude  to  middlemarch  in order to reconcile ourselves to its finale in which our last glimpse of george eliots modern theresa is as a comfortable matron very properly devoted to her second husband and only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother any other novelist would have ended the novel differently and with a good deal more stageeffect but george eliots finding is the true one and if we part from dorothea with somi regret that her first great failure as the wife of mr iasaubon should have no better compensation than the very prosaic success of a marriage with will ladislaw it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befall the worthiest natures while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy the most carefully mwrought out of all george eliots novels with the exception perhaps of romola  middlemarch  is also the most uelancholy in its tone it is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of haracter that go to make up our commonplace society and the impression left by this  study of provincial life  is one of pftinful but healthy sadness there is nothing of the misanthrope in george eliot if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world she does so altogether in order to help on their correction and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preachers sermons but we have no more right to look for shallow merrymaking in her books than to seek amusement from  ecclesiastes or  lamentations she does not preach that  all is vanity and vexation of spirit or that  the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied  but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered it is with others in their various ways as with dorothea whose later life is the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions among the ay oek a her mises it was never maid in t ighborood of middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own ageon modes of education which make a womans knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondlyasserted beliefs while this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe there will be collisions such as those in dorotheas life where great feelings will take the aspect of error and great faith the aspect of illusion dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in mid dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round we see her first in striking con trast to her simpleminded sister celia and her as simpleminded uncle mr brooke as a highsouled young woman  enamoured of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes the rashness causes her to embrace mr casaubon the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness until all her  vague ideals  have to give place to  the common yearning of womanhood in noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change we have seen how gradually dorothea loses faith in her husband without swerving at all in her duty towards him even as the most exacting purist might define it and how as gradually the way is prepared for her devotion after her husbands death to his cousin will ladislaw it is not easy to like young ladislaw one is tempted to think that in marrying him dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying mr casaubon how much pleasanter it would have been for lydgate to be her husband but unfortunately things do not always go pleasantly in real life and the fate that befalls dorothea is very natural though not very welcome lydgates fate is harder than dorotheas this portrait of the brave man of science whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallowhearted beauty is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of dorothea lydgate and rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of  middlemarch and in tracing their history george eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an illassorted marriage not the consequences with which novelreaders are familiar in which the silly wife runs away from her husband or the husband is a brute to his wife but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken perhaps george eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show  oh it is hard says dorothea to him that all this should come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways there is no sorrow i have thought more about than thatto love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail if selfish rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to dorothea unselfish mary garth is a no less complete foil of another sort the really pleasantest portions of  fiddle march are those that recount the sayings and doings of lmary and her father caleb garth and caleb garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent welldoing that makes no pretence tovirtue asexcellent in itswayisthe study of nicholas bulstrode the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied bulstrode3 downfall is described with great i ability and perhaps the best part of the description is f this which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she  has heard of his wrongdoings and of the worse doings r attributed to him t she locked herself in her room she needed time to get used s to her maimed consciousness her poor lopped life before she  could walk steadily to the place aotted her a new rgicbin light had fallen on her husbands character and she could not j ge him leniently the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit he had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal but this imperfectlytaught woman whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork had a loyal spirit within her the man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life and who had unvaryingly cherished hernow that punishment had l fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him tihere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul withering it the more by uloving proximity she knew when she locked her door that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow and say of his guilt i will mourn and not ixcproach but she needed time to gather up her strength she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife when she had resolved to go down she prepared herself by t ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker tiey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation she took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1ack gown and instead of wearing her muchadorned cap and large bows of hair she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b netcap which made her look suddenly like an early methodist bulstrode who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well had spent the time in an agitation co aal to hers he had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others and had acquiesced in that probability as something easier to him than any confession but now that he imagined the amelnt of her knowledge come he awaited the result in anguish liii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him and tiiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him he had not touched it he felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery perhaps he should never see his wifes face with affection in it again and if he turned to god there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution it was eight oclock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered he dared not look up at her he sat with is eyes bent down and as she went towards him she thought he looked smallerhe seemed so withered and shrunken a moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair and the other on his shoulder she said solemnly 1 t kindly look up nicholas he raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half damazed for a moment her pale face her changed mourning css the trembling about her mouth all said  i know  and her hands and eyes rested gently on him he burst out crying and tiny cried together she sitting at his side they could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim or of the acts which had brought it down on them his confession was silent and her promise of faithfulness was silent openminded as she was she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire she could not say  how much is only slander and false suspicion   and he did not say  i ani innocent the charity of middlemarch is as notable as its wisdom in every way it is a book to be glad of and if it does not enhance george eliots fame it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians   i i  middlemarch saturday march 30 1s72 literature by george eliot book iii waiting for death blackwood  sons the third instalment of  middlemarch ends in doubta doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form old peter featherstone not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind is dying fast and vulturelike the featherstones and waules close round him with testamentary purpose brothers solomon and jonah and sisters martha and jane take bodily possession of stone court where are also installed mary garth of right and mrs viney and her son fred by mr featherstones request that the featherstones should hang together against the vineys is natural still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves and that there should be a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him no scrutiny however can open the secret of old peters iron box true to himself the old man snaps and snarls at everybody is oracular as to his will and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power in the night alone with mary garth he dies he has it seems made two wills of which he wishes to burn one but both remain  and upon their tenor hangs fred vineys life for fred has borrowed money with all belief in his powers of repayment  having the superfluous securities of hope at his command and mary garths father has backed freds bill and fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh and  not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people is now in most unhappy plight seeing himself in his true light as a pitiful rascal who is robbing other people of their savings but it is not for fred and mary alone that the plot is thickening lydgatehow or why it would be as hard to say as in real life  finds himself engaged to rosamond viney and mr viney who is expecting stone court for fred has given his consent to the arrangement  with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch for  the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action and mr viney has discovered that old featherstones death is only his  demise and  considered as a demise old featherstones death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity1 and besides lydgate and rosamond dorothea too claims our interest as mr casaubon is too clearly dying fastindeed has a fit which can have but one meaning and dorotheas future is still further perplexed by the fact that mr brooke who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men has asked young will ladislaw to stop with him  feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas and more than all exactly as  old and young put the riddle of which the answer lies in  waiting for death so in  waiting for death  a riddle is put in the thirtieth chapter the answer to which is even harder to guess and ought to be the hinge of the tale for the rest  middlemarch is itself celia is to become lady chettam and is very full of happiness mr brook is more happily vague than ever his advice to casaubon after his fit being  yes yes get dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings and shuttlecock now i dont know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime i remember it all the fashion to be sure your eyes might not stand that casaubon but you must unbend you know why you might take to some light study  conchology now  i always think that must be a light study or get dorothea to read you light things smollett roderick random humphrey clinker they are a little broad but she may read anything now shes married you know i remember they made me laugh uncommonlytheres a droll bit about a postilions breeches we have no such humour now i have gone through all these things but they might be rather new to you and we have one or two new actors such as mr horrock the horsedealer  whose costume at a glance gives him a thrilling association with horses and whom nature has blessed with  a face which by dint of mongolian eyes and a nose mouth and chin seeming to follow his hatbrim in a moderate inclination upwards gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind and when accompanied by adequate silence likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding an infinite fund of humourtoo dry to flow and probably in a state of immovable crustand a critical judgement which if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it would be the thing and no other and with mr horrock is mr trumbull the auctioneer who is  an amateur of superior phrases never using poor language without immediately correcting himself aud who if anybody had observed of him that mr borthrop trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that still more heavily outlined is solomon featherstone who  thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellowmen inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there  coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others and there is also mrs plymdale who  doesnt think that marrying is everything and indeed  would have a girl first seek the kingdom of god  but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters and so holds that  a girl should keep her heart within her own power what the end of  middlemarch may be we hardly wish to guess its chief interest is as a study of english life the action does not absorb us as in  adam bede and the mill ou the floss there are too many actors for that and too many threads woven into the one strand  but as a thoughtful anatomy of english habits and english modes of thought full of dry quiet humour waiting for death is worthy its author whether  middlemarch as a whole will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails remains to be seen certainly as yet each part has been perfect of itself,britain
fiction the spoils of poynton by henry james heinemann the works of mr henry james are a series of exquisite disappointments to say that they are exquisite is to say what all know each phrase is sought out and each shade of character finely observedhave not many reviewers said it  he is admirable in his cleverness his conscientiousness and his right selfrespect he seeks the phrase but he is never the fool of the phrase no bright and dluring collocation of words like some dancing lignt has ever misled him ho does not go out with his gun potting at the gonerol publichas never brought down hts brace of tall curates with the two volumes fired in rapid successionand they mako bigger bags in the crockett cabbageplot mr henry james writes for the few and belongs to though very few it is indeed almost a pity that so many dunces have been banged bullied and frightened into saying that they like though work of mr henry james but that he is really too subtle it is a pity because in the first place no dunce ever liked though work of mr henry james and in though second place because the trouble with mr honry james is that he is not subtle enough for instance he seems to have feared at times that his style wanted warmth geniality spontaneity and thus fearing ho gives us an occasional didnt for  did not this is not subtle and it misses its effect his horoos and horoines again tako that course of action which best satisfies good tasto and feeling but though rejected tlio other course is considered they deliberate they choose they aro painfully anxious to have tlio good approval of everybody thoir most spirited action is discounted by nervousness and long selfcommunion we find ourselves liking thom less than we ought to like them they are all right but they have to take so much trouble to bo all right mr henry james is subtle enough to work out the difficult sum correctly but not subtle enough to rub out though working on his slate and loavo only though effective answer his characters are not marionettes they do live and move and havo their being but they know all the time that mr honry james is looking they aro not sufficiently disengaged and projected if he were half as good nobody would mind and six lines of stereotyped approval for he woidd still be good would be his portion but he has a point of view an insight a right judgment a hatred of the common u stylo ho makes and uses his phruso liko a niastor and lie takes caro wore his gifts and his conscientiousness less ho would disappoint less as it is ono cannot forgive him the least thingsuch forgiveness would be an insult it is perhaps possible that his croativo faculty and his critical faculty work simultaneously each to the prejudice of the other  and that it would be better if he first made and then corrected however that may be his work i always exquisite and yet always something of a disappointment  the spoils of poynton  are furniture objects of art they have been collected through long years with tove and knowledge by mrs gareth and her husband poynton is a beautiful treasurehouse a little heaven mrs gareth is now a widow when her son owen marries she will have to give up poynton and all that therein is to him and his bride and to retire to ricksa lesser place formerly the residence of an aunt and furnished as all aunts always furnish now mrs gareth is the real collector these spoils are almost her reason for living she loves them understands them respects them to one who could equal her affection and appreciation to one worthy of these beautiful things she could surrender them her haunting horror is that she will have to surrender to mona brigstock of the brigstocks of waterbath of whom owen appears to be becoming fond if poynton is a little heaven waterbath so far as the house is concerned is simply hades without the picturesquenesscheap tasteless full of gimcracks mona is beautiful wooden expressionless grasping knows that the spoils are very valuable and is incapable of considering them or anything else otherwise than commercially owen is a handsome heavy honest fool of ponderous probity but also of an almost incredible weakness and fleda is the other girl worthy as mrs gareth knew of the spoils and worthy of far more there is the germ of the book most of the people and some of the motives when mr henry james makes out a little list of his achievements and it would be difficult to imagine anything more unlikely he must not omit mrs gareth he has seldom if ever given us anything better the character is clear objective original she is a woman of refined taste and is sometimes almost slangy sho is capable of great sacrifices and is guilty of conduct thatwell the brigstocks say its simply stealing says owen plaintively and we are inclined to agree with the brigstocks yet only at the end do we remember that there are things in her which baldly stated and at first sight might appear paradoxical throughout sho has boon quite true and convincing it is the misfortune of mr henry james that he draws those people best whom he does not quite like there is much that is good in the delineation of owen and fleda but they do not convince as mrs gareth convinces the story contains at least two strong dramatic situations the humour is delightful the style is mr henry james if it disappoints it is for want of a little moro warmth and humanity because though reader cries out for someone who shall bo admirablo without being nervous and hesitating and nover finds that person if though prosont writor may add a personal noto on another point it is a pity that mr heinemann should dofaco by an absurd stamp on though titlepage such a book as thi3 when ho sends it out for review  the spoils of poynton new novels by henry james i heinemann tne first impression produced on the reader by mr jamess latest novel is that he is looking at things through glasses not quite suited to his focus the next that it must have cost though author a deal of trouble to writo if you debar yourself from theuse of 44 spade 4 implement of husbandry or 44 adjective shovel it is not always easy to find an english phrase that will legitimately denote the article and when you do find one the chances are that your render will not be sufficiently in thehabit of associating it with the object indicated to be able without conscious effort to proceed from it to the idea of that object and conscious effort is just what the novelreader does not want the odd thing is that the story is really simple enough mrs gereth is a widow who has spent her married life in making a palace of art at poynton the bouse and all the pretty things in it have become her only sons property and the question that torments her is whether he will marry some one not only capable of appreciating her  lordly pleasurehouse but also willing to allow its1 creator to continue in undisturbed enjoyment of it unfortunately he being a person of dull perceptions settles upon a girl who has been brought up in an atmosphere of opulent bad taste but is sharp enough to see that mrs gereths bricdbrac is worth holding fast to mean time that lady has pitched upon a damsel who combines the qualifications which she requires in a daughterinlaw and the story amounts practically to a narrative of the contest for the spoils of poynton between mona brigstocke and mrs gereth fighting behind her protigie fleda vetch we cannot exactly congratulate mr james this time on his taste in nomenclature the situation is further complicated by the fact that the elder lady when retiring from the house in consequence of her sons engagement carries off a large and important selection from the portable property contained in it the struggle is well balanced and the reader is never justified till it is over in anticipating one end or the other to it the more obvious characters owen gereth and mona are concrete enough if not very interesting they are the matter mrs gereth the force is decidedly more of an abstraction and not wholly a pleasant one if we rightly decypher the plau of campaign which she enjoins upon fleda as for fleda herself well the mind and heart of a girl such as mr james seems to have in his eye is an unexplored region to any man so anything may be put there and no one has any right to say it cannot be there the only real fault in the construction of the book is the fire at the end a catastrophe of that kind has no business in a novel unless it be either cause or effect now here so far as the story goes it is neither,britain

  the napoleon of notting hill by gilbert k chesterton lane humour in our day is so scarce and humourists are so few that mr chestertons farandole of farce may easily be wrongly praised it is farce but not pure farce for it often drops into buffoonery this vehement jumble of styles is fatiguing for the kingdom of humour cannot be taken by violence however brilliant farce is the staple of mr chestertons humour he is a farceur with ideas now farce is an excellent and an english thing by all means let us revive it but let us remember that humour has its laws as well as poetry or mathematics what are those laws alas humour still awaits its blackstone perhaps the best code of humour is that which is suggested by mr wattsdunton in his articleon  the renascence of wonder in chamberss  cyclopaedia of literature he points out that there are two kinds of humour absolute and relative  while in the case of relative humour that which amuses the humourist is the incongruity of some departure from the laws of convention in the case of absolute humour it is the incongruity of some departure from the normal as fixed by nature herself applying this test to mr chesterton we find that his humour is as a rule relative the incongruity which amuses him is a departure from the convention of monarchy the convention of municipal routine the convention of behaviour the convention of clothes he invents men who violate these ordinances in england eighty years hence the king is chosen like a juryman by alphabetical rotation the lot falls on auberon quin an alleged humourist in whom we recognize with the help of mr graham robertsons illustrations a shadowy likeness to mr max beerbohm humour doubtless deteriorates on a throne if king auberon were a real humourist he would not spoil the ripe humour of royalty by devising feeble practical jokes his humour is no laughing matter these imaginary borough councils with their provosts halberdiers banners and flamboyant ceremonial are not nearly so humorous as the real borough councils with their pompous mayors who glory in robes and chains of office not one of these visionary cities is so absurd as that actual city of westminster which emblazons its pride on the walls of its very lavatories this is a case indeed in which truth is funnier than fiction rich as is the humour of the borough councils there is something which is richer stillthe humour of the lord mayor and the city aldermen the incomparable humour of gog and magog not until adam wayne enters does mr chesterton reach the true realm of farce the conception of a man possessed by a devouring passion for notting hill is really farcical and the battles between the patriots of pump street and the municipal reformers who desire to annex it are full of that mockillusion that sham gravity which is the attribute of farce the kings dispatches as war correspondent of the court journal are capital fooling and the burlesque of the style of the late g w steevens is very amusing the gas and water strategy of the napoleon of notting hill is deliciously farcical like all empires notting hill is sapped by success its decline and fall lead to a philosophic dialogue between the sham king and the sham napoleon which lifts the farce into the higher region of irony   suppose i am god said the voice  and suppose i made the world in idleness suppose the stare that you think eternal are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy suppose the sun and the moonare only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant opened alternately in a neverending winksuppose t am god and having made things laugh at them   and suppose i am man answered the other and suppose that i give the answer that shatters even a laugh suppose i do not laugh back at you do not blaspheme you do not curse you but suppose standing up straight under the sky with every power of my being i thank you for the fools paradise you have made suppose i praise you with a literal pain of ecstasy for the jest that has brought me so terrible a joyi ask you in the name of heaven who wins  this passage certainly comes near to being absolute humour it propounds a kind of spiritual pantagruelism as an answer to the irony of an ironic god the idea of course is not new it is as old as the hillsor as the athenaum for more than a quarter of a century ago it was put forward in our columns  the humouristis so perpetually overwhelmed by the irony of the entire game cosmic and human from the droll little conventions of the village pothouse to those of london of paris of new york of pekinup to the apparently meaningless dance of the planets round the sunup again to that greater and more meaningless waltz of suns around the centrehe is so delighted with the delicious foolishness of wisdom the conceited ignorance of knowledge the grotesqueness even of the standard of beauty itselfso overwhelmed is the humourist with the whim of all thiswith the incongruity that isof the normal itselfwith the almightyjoke of the cosmos as it isthat he sees nothing  funny  in departures from laws which to him are in themselves the very quintessence of fun and he laughs the laugh of rabelais and of sterne  for he feels that behind this rich incongruous show there must be a beneficent showman he knows that although at the top of the constellations sits circumstance harlequin and king bowelless and blind shaking his starry cap and bells there sits far above even harlequin himself another being greater than hea being who because he has given us the delight of laughter must be good and who in the end will somewhere set all these incongruities right mr chesterton does not see higher than the harlequin god he does not see the  beneficent showman but he does see that in the ideal man the humourist and the idealist are two lobes of the same brain he finds this ideal man like tolstoy in the ploughmanthe common man whom mere geniuses like you and me can only worship like a god but does the common man really see the ridiculous as the sublime and the sublime as the ridiculous  if so the world is peopled with chestertons and infinitely more amusing than many of us find it the book is at any rate evidence that mr chesterton might do capital work in fiction if he would take adequate time and trouble  for his narrative moves easily and he has an immense romantic gusto,britain
  a room with a view au  by e m forster arnold this story of the loveaffairs of a commonplace young lady and her two commonplace lovers is too flat for sustained enjoyment the dialogue is amateurish and the author who takes pains to make some of the characters revolt against  conventionality nevertheless thinks an elderly and esteemed acquaintance and his son  abominably impertinent for offering their services to two young ladies as guides over an italian church occasional passages such as that describing an english tourists italian form a welcome relief,britain
the herkomers by sir hubert von herkomer 7s 6d net macmillan last spring sir hubert von herkomer published for private circulation  a sumptuous volume giving an account of his family and himself the main purpose being a study of the artists father and the relations between father and son the book was enriched by 28 admirable fullpage reproductions of paintings and drawings relevant to the subject apparently a good deal of public interest was aroused for we have now a reissue of the work by mac millan  co though reduced in size from the original elition and containing only six of the twentyeight illustrations it forms a handsome volume and cannot fail to prove acceptable to all interested in character and art as the original edition was fully reviewed by professor john adams in the mlay i910 number of the bookman it is unnecessary to go into further details as to the subject matter a point of some interest is that while the original edition is boldly marked volume i there is no indication in this reissue that there is to be a sequel it is true that the last words of the book  it may be as well to break the story of my life here may be held to promise that there is to be a continuation but on the other hand the work is certainly complete so far as it goes and there is no suggestion of the broken shaft probably sir hubert will finish the book for his own satisfaction and for private circulation if this be so there is very little doubt but that a companion volume to the present will be called for by alessrs macmillan and welccwed by the public,britain
beatrix of clare by john reed scott e grant richards to those who enjoy a good historical romance we can thoroughly recommend mr scotts new novel the period is that of richard iii the hero being one of his body knights and the heroine a beautiful countess in her own right a ladyinwaiting to the queen the author has made good use of his opportunities the story is pleasantly told in a straightforward way and though the plot is not particularly original the characters are well drawn and the interest both personal and historical is maintained the four coloured pictures by clarence f underwood are good  beatrix of clare by john reed scott e grant richards 6s   the hero of mr scotts new novel is a young knight in the service of the duke of gloucester and consequently richard iii is adorned with many virtues which the historians have not seen fit to allow him sir aymer de lacy however is his enthusiastic follower from the moment he is tended by beatrix countess of clare to the end of a story which conveniently stops a short time before the battle of bosworth field historical novels are written very glibly nowadays and it is seldom that a writer can avoid the use of the wellknown ingredients  beatrix of clare  begins with a highway robbery sir aymer being the victim and the scene is conducted with a chivalry that does credit to all concerned beatrix the richest heiress in england meets the wounded knight and the result is love at first sight of cgurse there is the bold bad rival and when the heiress is kidnapped by the wicked lord darby sir aymer proceeds to rescue herby a series of daring exploits space is found however for suchhistorical incidents as the crowning of richard theexecutionsof hastings and the duke of buckingham and the deaths of the princes in the tower on the whole the book is interesting mainly because it makes no great tax on the imagination  and mr scott writes forcibly and with an enthusiasm for the mediaeval that suggests an american origin in this connexion the reviewer is tempted to point out the incongruity of a spelling which though for the most part american occasionally drops into the employment of the obsolete words like  traveler and  favour  arefollowed by  gaiety  and  gayly this is a fault that will irritate the observant reader however  beatrix of clare  can be recommended to those in search of a readable novel there is almost as much colour in the prose as there is in the illustrations of mr clarence underwood,britain

the voyage out by virginia woolf duckworth fe co 6s there is some good work in  the voyage out not to mention erudition the favourite reading of the ships steward was huxley herbert spencer and henry george while he turned to emerson and mr hardy for relaxation the central idea of gathering a small company into the isolated world of a passenger ship and later in a south american island and leaving them to explore each others natures is full of possibilities the author has sketched her characters with a few deft strokes but the incidents are too loosely put together and there is a great deal of superfluous material the language is not always grammatical and sometimes forcible to the verge of coarseness but there is a considerable amount of shrewd observation and clever cynicism the pathos of the heroines death is the more poignant for the restraint with which it is treated and such egotism as that of the young man who says of his novelwriting   i m good secondrate  about as good as thackeray i should say is delightful in its frankness  the voyage out by virginia woolf cs duckworth it is the detail and intricacy of this essentially human lootlk that gives it its strength and individuality the man characters with their various and distinctive ersonalities miss w oolf describes so intimately and with so sure a touch that the reader is made familiar with each one in turn onscious of eat hi trivial affectation and all the lights and shades of the different natures our first acquaintance with the principal characters in the story is made on their journey out to south america in a small cargo steamer the captains daughter is a girl of twentyfour whose innocence or rather ignorance of the world and its ways is equivalent to a childs and the author tells of her awakening and development cleverly and sympathetically the conversation is perhaps the only thing in a very realistic book that somewhat lacks realism but it is so sparklingly vivacious so witty and entertaining that we are likely to forget the fact that the average individual has neither such a quick understanding nor such skill at making epigrams and similes as the human beings who people mliss woolfs story and enjoy the dialogue just because it is brilliant and humorous the keynote to the book is the authors clear and complete knowledge of her fellowcreatures and an alertness for the minor things of lifethe tangled undergrowth of little incidentsthat make each separate existence at once so commonplace and so unique,britain
new novels at ale villa ro8e by a e w mason hodder  stoughton an elderly dilettante in the gay world of aixlesbains lends piquancy to the story of murder and its detection for which mr mason has deserted the field of romance he is a great improvement on the stupid characters or rather puppets who form the usual foil to the clever detective and the intricate deductions of the mind which solves the problem are decidedly ingenious it is obvious by all rules of sentiment that the pretty young lady who has disappeared from the villa cannot be guilty of the murder and we think the expert will detect at least one of the culprits pretty early but the expert is not the reading public which should be well entertained by the surprises of the mystery and grateful for a style of writing which shows both ease and an excellent sense of point,britain

a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen  co realism is so often an excuse for immorality in what is called art that one can gladly praise mr arthur morrison for a realism which deals frankly with dirt brutality and crime his story is without plot a mere straightforward chronicle of a mt of life in the lowest class at the eastend of london it is told with great vigour and with powerful simplicity the author must no doubt seem to many to dwell too minutely upon details of fighting and to be tempted at times into exaggeration in the following horrible account of an affray between women the reader can hardly fail to mark the zest of the narrator norah walsh vanquished champion now somewhat recovered looked from a window saw her enemy vulnerable and ran out armed with a bottle she stopped at the kerb to knock the bottom off the bottle and then with an exultant shout seized sally green by the hair and stabbed her about the face with the jagged points blinded with blood sally released her hold on mrs perrott and rolled on her back struggling fiercely  but to no end for norah walsh kneeling on her breast stabbed and stabbed again till pieces of the bottle broke away the human frame can bear a great deal but if this description is taken literally it is pretty clear that sally must have been killed on the spot at another place it is said that a constable was laid low by a firegrate adroitly let drop from an upper window laid low may of course mean killed but if so the author for once fails to choose the plainest word if it does not the exaggeration is palpable many pages are devoted to elaborate accounts of free fights and one chapter describing a single combat furnishes the most disgusting passages in the book what is the object of it all those who have to pass their time in police courts or in the central criminal court know very well that villainy such as mr morrison depicts and worse exists in london the clergy of all denominations the officers of the chanty organisation society mr waughs society for protecting children and other societies and many philanthropists who work in the eastend have certainly not uah remiss in letting the world know what jsj on in places like the jago mr sorrison has nothing new to tell he is lycastic about the philanthropists who surely do not deserve his sarcasm if his aim is to beguile novelreaders into taking interest in the slums it is not to be commended the facts are known attempts have been made to attack the evils by rousing excited sentiment better directed efforts are not wanting and those who are in earnest must deplore the method of the novelist who dwells upon revolting details of blood and blows if the example of dickens is pleaded as a precedent it must he remembered that dickens went straight to a definite point and had something to reveal with mr morrison it is not so fortunately there is one bright spot in his pages he sincerely admires his father gturt who labours without much success hut with fine courage and perseverance the dedication of the book to mr jay the vicar of holy trinity shoreditch suggests an explanation of the word  jago  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen mr arthur morrison has drawn upon fresh material for this powerful and unequal story it is a steep desoent from the mean streets to the jago one to be indicated by a considerable deepening of the tints upon that lurid map of mr charles booths it means all the difference between respectability as an ideal rarely attained to and respectability as the memory of an ideal long ago forsaken for in the jago for one hundred years the blackest pit in london you touch the very bottom of the social scale the ultimate dregs and offscourings of humanity dealing thus as it now does with the extremes of filth and rapacity and cruelty mr morrisons style has dropped something of its old effectiveness powerful it is still and grimly humorous and scrupulously faithful but the quality of tragic restraint so noticeable in the earlier book has hardly fair play among conditions where the sheerest fidelity of expression can only read like extravagance tragedy indeed is wellnigh impossible in the jago for want of that conflict between good and evil out of which tragedy essentially springs there is no good at these levels to count for anything we are bound to say that we think there are passages in mr morrisons book where the brutality exceeds the limits of art the account for instance of the street fight between sally green and norah walsh is a thing which like certain scenes in le debdcle and one or two exceptional stories of mr kiplings stirs not the imagination but the gorge nevertheless it is in many ways a book of extraordinary merit for the remorseless vigour of the descriptions and for the dramatic power with which the writer has conceived entered into and maintained throughout the jago point of view to put this squalid record of robbery and murder as they are side by side with the fagin and bill sykes scenes in oliver twist is to get an object lesson on the difference between the realistic and the romantic conceptions of fiction mr morrisons genius we think is rather for the episodic than for the epic the book would have held together better if attention had been concentrated throughout upon dicky perrott who is admirably done and not divided as it is at the end between him and his villainous father mr weech the   fence who narks  and gets the reward of a  nark is a creation conscious that his picture is lacking in high lights he has introduced an heroic parson the rev henry sturt but the rev henry sturt has as little to do in the book as he was able to do in the jago and his real function seems to be to afford an opportunity for mr morrison to express his preference for the methods of the church in the slums over those of general booth or of toynbee hall  a child of the jago0   people are so very genteel arent they     but hang it all men like ourselves neednt talk as though the world was built of hardbake its a mighty relief to speak truth with a man who knowsa man not rotted through with sentiment by the mouth of the jago surgeon mr morrison has expressed his own attitude the mild sugary speech of philanthropists the comfortable complacency of westend slummers the blind absurd enthusiasm that looks to make the eastend into paradise by culturehe turns and rends them all for he knows that they have not seen have not dared to see the black slough of sin and cruelty and unspeakable wrong that lies beyond their efforts and their courage woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing  because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered mortar say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye 0 great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it it is an attitude only tolerable to the courageous it is a knowledge that would kill if it were forced on the feeble but the attitude and the knowledge must be a part of any true understanding of the world as it is made it is a recognition of a state of things desperate but not entirely hopeless he gives us dicky a young thief a man of the world an evil world at ten yet staunch spirited responsible and he sends father sturt in our way probably to show the kind of temper that has any chance of redeeming the dwellers in such a place of crime and misery sturt has no illusions he knows the worst of the district he has tenacity courage a keen sense of humour and cannot be humbugged it is no use paying mr morrison compliments at this time of day on his vigour and his unusual ability these must be everywhere acknowledged they are acknowledged by us very heartily but this new book of his has pages which it is almost impossible to read we do not combat his general attitude at all he does not pretend to tell the whole tale of eastend misery which has its genteel sides of course but he tells one awful chapter of it and we respect his sense of responsibility in doing so however much he shatters our complacency and our shallow convictions that alls right with the world we do not accuse him of exaggeration and as to his excesses of realism we can at least understand the temptation but to understand does not take away the right of protest and we do protest against the useless riot of brutality the orgies of physical violence which we are made witnesses of if we read the book through zola has never outdone some of the pages here in their horrible defiance of any sensitive feelings we may have but we declare our right to have these feelings respected if not pampered and our opinion that an unblinking perusal of these tales of brutal fights would show much more morbid efleminacy than any shrinking from them would do they are no necessary part of mr morrisons strenuous and courageous purpose but we must not part from the book with a censure for dicky the hero must be given his due in the midst of the sordid cruel desperate jago he grows up unashamed of it accepting its conditions ambitious of its honours a plant of the hideous soil yet a sturdy not unwholesome plant he has affection loyalty and endless courage mr morrison killed him not for the sake of his pathetic deathscene we are sure but because he loved him and his heart  1 a child of the jago by arthur morrison 6s methuen revolted against the thought of the lads ingenuity hardening into ugly craft his brave philosophy into callousness his daring into insolent crime and so he lets the child of the jago die in no odour of sanctity to be sure but round the little outcast from all that is respectable he has woven a halo of charm,britain
i the jtiflg8 agent by arthur paterson 11einemann we have read with pleasure mr patersons wellwritten and exciting story built up round the fascinating personality of john churchill first duke of marlborough the author has been at pains to make himself well acquainted with that great man and his times and if he has fallen under the spell of his hero who certainly appears in a most favourable light we do not blame him the kings agent is williams confidential adviser and spy a coldblooded plotter a noted duellist a libertine and a villain and yet with a human side which excites our sympathy in skilfully drawn contrast is his rival for the hand of a charming girl a simple impetuous young soldier the plot centres round their struggle for her hand in which marlborough and the great mrs freeman the young ladys selfconstituted guardians play a large part the plotting is deep and cunning as befits those days of unrest and uncertainty but works out easily and naturally included are by pictures of william himself ii a little brownfaced man with keen eyes and a huge nose dressed in a claretcoloured suit that did not fit him of the princess anne and her stupid but goodnatured husband and of a lord tottenham a typical nobleman of the period which show no little care and penetration on the authors part the interest is well sustained till the last page and we recommend this as a thoroughly interesting specimen of the historical type of romance,britain

the odd women by george gissing 3 vols lawrence  bullen as might be expected mr gissings new novel the odd women is intensely modern actual in theme as well as in treatment amidst the vexed social questions that surround us on all sides and seem to defy solution he has chosen one of real interest and has turned it to clever and original purpose the problem of the odd woman and what is to be done with her presents in truth a grim enough aspect as treated by mr gissing the interest is of almost too painful a character yet it is full of suggestion and significance those who know him best recognise that his manner and method are generally vivid and to some extent individual though by no means enchanting here as in former novels we have pages of something more resembling the reporters than the artists touch the story is anything but crude or unsympathetic yet in the telling it is often a little inadequate journalese is conspicuous not by its absence in spite of this the book is better than merely readable it is absorbing one feels that the author is more than master of his subject that he has turned it about and around and thoroughly knows its capabilities as a novel it is decidedly uncheering the outlook is in some ways even more dejressing than in  new grub street yet atent in it all is an element of hope a something that encourages the idea that with time and effort the baffling problem of the odd women may be successfully solved many of the characters and episodes are extremely well drawn the dialogue is of the right sort natural and to the purpose mr gissing has not perhaps on the whole written anything stronger or more striking,britain

bircter tows by anthoot trollope i author of t the warden 3 vols london longman and co ightshade a novel by wm johnston mva london bentley tec rival suitors a novel by mrs hiibback 3 vols london skeet continrations of fiction are always failures that it as compared with their predecessors cooper and bulwer are not exceptions although their attempts were more successful than any others the cause is not difficult to i discover if the first fiction is a good one it is complete in itself it has a catastrophe and there we leave it and if we think of it at all we like to remember it as a whole a continuation of it cannot revive an interest felt long ago we feel it to be a sort of desecration to bring the same personages before us in some new shape in new characters and costumes they are not the same to us and no skill can make them such they are strangers in borrowed manners and dresses aping the looks and tones but wanting the spirit of reality and truth mr trollope has not succeeded better in this endeavour than those greater novelists who have gone before him barchester towers is a continuation of the warden with the same heroine widowed and marrying a second time but apart from the difficulty of the attempt to coin a plot out of such materials there is the ame want of skill in the invention of a story which we had noticed in the warden m1r trollope however like his mother does not write novels for the purpose of telling a story but to exhibit character and illustrate certain phases of modern society that is the aim of barchester towers it is levelled at the religious feuds of our daythe parties that divide the church and satire is unsparingly levelled against such as do not accord with the authors opinions or iympathies mrs bold the widow the eleanor harding of the warden is courted by three suitors who are thus contrasted with one another and we are introduced to high church and low church parsons and an evangelical bishopmr trollope tendencies being strongly against the low church which he does not omit to present in the most unfavourable aspect as a novelist always can if he pleases and for which reason it is that we have systematically denounced polemical fictions as an unfair method of warfare ad a perversion of the design of fiction which is to teach virtue by example not to introduce controversy or dogmatism in the form of a narratlive apart from this objection barchesfer towern is entitled to critical praise it is clever in its sketches of character and in its somewhat malevolent satire as a satire it is amusing but it will convince nobody mr trollope has powers which applied to a more genial theme would give him a high place in fiction the same objection only to a still greater extent applies to nightshade it is an attack on roman catholicism and more especially on jesuitism the tale if it may be so termed is the attempt to convert two orphan sisters to the romish church partly for the sake of their souls but chifly for the sake of their fortunes to this end the jesuits forge a will and by forcible abduction carry off the two sisters to the continent where they are conveyed to convents first and afterwards to dungeons one charles annandale a protestant of course comes to their rescue releases them from their thraldom exposes the jesuit plots and restores the young ladies to home and fortune such is this absurd and improbable fiction contrived purposely to enable the author to give vent to extremely unchristian emotions and hatreds which he does in the style and manner of a schoolboy  the wifes sister  was mrs hubbacks most successful novel it was remarkable for its vivid portraiture the personages who played their parts in it lived and moved before usrealities and not abstractions this recommended it to favour in spite of many faults of structure and composition the rival suitors preserves the merits and avoids some of the defects of its predecessor it is a better plot and the writing is nore natural and unaffected while the characters are equally of flesh and blood mrs ilubback has profited by practice and experience be ginners are always too anxious about what they think to be style  they are not content to put their thoughts into plain words and so let their style adapt itself to their tlitughts as naturally it would and thus become their own but they must nees go out of the way to look for a dress in which to clothe their ideasand usually they copy the dress of some author already famous and so appear to the world as poor imitators if mrs ilubback continues to improve as she has done she will take a very high place in fiction we can commend tde rival suitors to the libraries it will not sleep upon the shelves  i rmiadar towrs by anthony trolione antlw a i the warden three vols longmian a co bdow the swffe a tale of english country ife three vol smith elder and co the sister of charity by mm chalile two vo bentley mr anthony trollope has found more to tell of his friend the gentle warden of hirams hospital at barchester  of the various members of the wardens family it m be remembered that in the story of the warden mr pr centor harding ready to distrust himself had meekly accepted the decree of  the jupiter  newspaper that be wo an abuse and had resigned his charge of the old men who were maintained in the mismanaged charity thereupon as we now learn his disinterested conduct won for him during a few weeks the plaudits of the press the hospi tat funds were then taken in hand by parliament and the plan of the charity remodelled the post of warden with the salary reduced from eight hundred to four hundred and fifty pounds and with its duties augmented waited to be filled up how it was filled up and before it was filled what wars were waged under the shade of barchester cathedral towers between bishop and bishops wife chaplain archdeacon and all other magnates of the church of bar chester it is the purpose of this sequel to the warden to relate the new story is so far complete in itself that acquaintance with or recollection of its predecessor though desirable is not at al essential the former tale was good but this is better in the warden there were certain characters developed carefully and their creator by the time the book was ended had made the best of them real to his own mind in barchester towers we begin with them as real they speak for themselves and make themselves known promptly to the stranger without need of formal introduction the story however is quite new and most of the characters are new beginning with the new bishop of barchester whose palace is the centre of the plot for with the death of dr grantly the new volumes begin and with the true grief of his son the archdeacon whose energy and love of command mingle a natural desire to succeed to the bishopric with a yet more natural sorrow the ministry is changing when the bishop dies and the archdeacon sure of the support of the outgoing premier telegraphs news of the death to london without loss of time but he is too late the ministry has pased into new hands the archdeacon remains archdeacon to the end and the bishopric is given to dr and mrs proudie people professing liberality unfriendly to cathedral music and to all those highchurch tendencies which would be most to the taste of the chapter of barcbester cathedral they are rigid sabbatarians they meaning the lady who is both the bishop and the bishops wife the ladys pet preacher mr obadiah slope a descendant of the famous dr slop with an e appended to his name for love of euphony is made the bishops chaplain but slope has an ambition of his own to play the bishops part the question of the appointment of the new warden of hirams hospital is soon made the battleground of the contending factions into which the clerical society under the shade of barchester towers becomes quickly divided mr slope struggles with the bishops wife for mastery over the bishop and if the bishop never bad to lay his head upon a pillow with another pillow by the side of it there might be hope for the chaplain he almost succeeds the busy archdeacon cannot soil his dignity by entering personally into a contention with the hateful chaplain who has taken the first opportunity to sound from the cathedral pulpit a loud note of war but he makes use of his patronage to give a barchester living to a distinguished high churchman mr arabin competent to play very good dog to the chaplains cat moreover there is the family of dr stanhope a nonresident prebend who has been brought by the exercise of gentle episcopal pressure to reside for a few months in barebester stanhopes family is cleverly described and his daughter the beauty with the crippled feet who is the siren of the story and lures mr slope into a whirlpool is an odd character most skilfully worked out eleanor the precentors daughter widow of john bold and mother of a precious baby is the heroine of barchester towers with her for her money or her beauty or her worth three persons seek marriage the deans death opens a greater vacancy at barchester before the mighty question of the appointment of a new warden is settled mrs proudie triumphs of course over all meddlers between man and wife our old friend mr harding does not return to hirams hospital as warden and because he does not so much as know what a deans duties are in his determined conscientiousness and honesty be refuses to be made a dean but although not destined to be a deans daughter eleanor becomes a deans wife and the archdeacon attributes much of the good end to which everything is brought to his own activity in waging war against the bishops chaplain we have thus indicated what is the subject of mr trollopes novel of barchater towen but we should add that it does not depend only on story for its interest the careful writing the good humour with a tendency often to be shandean in its expression and the sense and right feeling with which the way is threaded among questions of high church and low church are very noticeable and secure for it unquestionable rank among the few really wellwritten tales that every season furnishes below the surface is another novel dealing with tvxed social questions of the day and giving much prominence to the antagonism between bighchurch and lowchurbh tu it has two hero sir regnald clinton a rocaholic with a lost son whose mother had been entrpped into a madhouse and oliver nugent of the 3aorbound farm a country gentleman by birth yeoden and working farmer by necessity a brave and congoientious man with strong religious feelings evangelical so to their colour he marries a young wife and is troubled first by the phenomenon of a hot dinner on sunday then by a croys over a mantelpiece and evangelical works in a ooalscuttle then by an unaccountable intimacy between his relative sir reginald clinton and his wife whom he refuse to distrust until a parcel found under her bed which really serves in the end to identify clintons lost son in a poor boy whom he has cherished and harboured seems to be demonstrative at once of his wifes unfaithfulness to evangelical religion and to him a story of this kind winds through many interesting details to a happy end the details are chiefly such as bring out views of english ouintry life of abuse in the management of workhouses and lunatic asylums details of life on a farm cottage scenes riots and the calling out of yeomanry with many matters of the kind the novel is one that keeps attention fixed and it is written in a genial often playful tone so that although containing much that is romantic in its incidents there is so strain for effect anywhere visible the temper of the work is throughout excellent from these two novels we pass to yet another in which social questions are discussed the siter of charity by mrs challice this is inferior in execution to the two works we have been discussing but deserves a fair position among novels of the day it deals especially with the hard lot of women who exposed to sore temptation fall into a pitiable sin  bareheskr towns by anthony trollope 3 vols longman  co enerlno the episcopal palace of barchester we find at once that  the warden was an uncompleted story mr harding is again upon the stage with eleanor tom towers and the jupiter there is however a new bishop of the diocese dr proudie successor of dr grantly with mrs proudie of evangelical ambition supplemented by a loosejointed lowchurch chaplain obadiah slope but we again make acquaintance with the loud clearvoiced overbearing archdeacon the tyrant of his father and fatherinlaw who has a theory about oblong diningtables and sets down any obnoxious brother asa beast thus mr trollope baa not to contend against the difficulty of interesting us at the outset in his personages or in his narrative wc are by no means strangers in barchester but he has perhaps to meet a worse difficultythat of prolonging successfully the interest of a tale which seemed some time ago to have been brought to a natural conclusion yet we doubt whether  barchester towers is not a more satisfactory book than  the warden it is certainly more dramatic in its construction the characters are more varied an infusion of romance gives lightness and brightness to the ecclesiastical picture it may still be said indeed that mr trollope has a happier art of drawing sketches from life and striking off pungent sayings hot and vivid upon the page than of elaborating the action of a novel nevertheless the incidents that lead up to the marriage of eleanor if to some extent conventional are yet contrived with skill and will engage the sympathies of other readers than those who appre date the excitement kindled in a cloistered city whenever a bishopric or deanery is vacant parallel with the many wooings and one love of the youthful widow moves the tearful tragedy of obadiah slopetragic in all but its consummation for though oily obadiahbeaten thwarted slapped in the face confuted confounded detected in the act of kissing a married ladys white hands discarded by his querulous patroness and driven with shame from the eden of virtnal episcopacyis comforted at last contracts an offensive and defensive alliance till death them do part with the opulent relic of a sugarrefiner including a house in baker street mounts a metropolitan pulpit and ripens in the golden warmth of patronage until the soul of sweetness enriched within him suffuses his plump rotundity and he ages and mellows and excites the envy of the irreligious and the poor this reverend slope is the low church personified and it is mr trollopes pleasure to mock his ral hair large hands weazel eye and sardonic intonations perhaps some of this sarcastic finish is unfairly applied but we are to take  barchester towers for what it isa satire on men and opinions in a certain corner of the eeclesia and if mr trollope makes low church ridiculous he does not make high church sublime to say the truth the entire establishment as here represented is but a worldly wellspread table with a hundred covers for baked meats purple and amber juices glittering in globes of crystal and all the spiced dainties of samarcand and lebanon to tempt the taste of the shoeless and the scripless no stirpliee1 party in england can complain that though novelist insults it by flattery to go a little further human nature itself has not much excuse for being aggrieved on that scoreunless it be the unpolluted babelike nature of the exwarden who is satisfied that he should not holli his wardenship and that he should not accept a deaneryor the warm honest crystaltransparent nature of eleanor bold who has to rebut the courtesies of obadiah slope with a tingling blow from her ivorywristed handto reject the explanations of bertie stanhope with sweet tears from her eyes and who ultimately takes up a definite position in her mortal state as mrs arabin wife of a blameless doctor and a dean bertie stanhope is a caricature the mundaneminded dr stanhope stands dimly in the background  but the signora herself with her loveliness and her wiles her fascinating insolence and ready points of repartee is brought out with singular force and fancy with respect to the other characters signora neroni last but one of the neros in reality however only a stanhope is the most conspicuous siren among the sinful she has a beautiful face and a perfect bust but has been crippled by the violence of an italian castaway her husband infidel philosophy and sensuous vanity occupy her remaining days and with almost harrowing humour mr trollope describes the victory of her sensuous charms over the conscience the worldly scruples the heart encased in carrotcoloured flesh of chaplain slope as an example of mr trollope s boldest method ot writing we will connect two passages relating to the passionate interview between mr slope and signora neroni  mr slope as was his custom asked for mr stanhope and was told as was the servants custom that the signora was in the drawingroom upstairs heaccordingly went he foundher as he always did lying on her sofa with a french volume before her and a beautiful inlaid writing case open on her table at the moment of his entrance she was in the act of writing ah my friend said she putting ont her left hand to him across her desk  i dkt not expect you today and was this very instant writing to you mr sloe taking the soft fair delicate hand in his and very soft and fair and delicate it waa bowed over it his huge red head and kissed it it was a sight to see a deed to record if the author coidd fitly do it a picture to put on canvas mr slojie was big awkward cumbrous and having his heart in his pursuit was ih at ease the lady was fair as we have said and delicate every thing about her was fine and refined her hand in his looked like a rose lying among carrots and when he kissed it he looked as a cow might do on finding such a flower among her food she was graceful as a couchant goddess and moreover as selfpossessed as venus must have been when courting adonis oh that such grace and such beauty should have condescended to waste itself on such a pursuiti was in the act of writing to you said she but now my scrawl may go into the basketand she raised the sheet of gilded notepaper from off her desk as though to tear it  indeed it shall not said he laying the embargo of half a stone weight of human flesh and blood upon the devoted paper  nothing that you write for my eyes signora shall be so desecrated and he took up the letter put that also among the carrots and fed on it and then proceeded to read it cracious me mr slopesaid she i hope you dont mean to say you keep all the trash i write to you half my tune i dont know what i write and when i do i know it is only fit for the lack of the fire i hope you have not that ugly trick of keeping letters at any rate j dont throw them into a wastepajhr basket if destruction is their doomed lot they perish worthily and are burnt on a pyre as dido was of oki with a steel pen stuck through them of course said she  to make the simile more complete of all the ladies of my acquaintance i think lady dido was the most absurd why did she not do as cleopatra did why ditl she not take out her ships and insist on going with him she could not bear to lose the land she hail got by a swindle and then she could not bear the loss of her lover so shu fell between two stools mr slope whatever you do never mingle love and businessmr slope blushed up to the eyes and over his mottled forehead to though very roots of his hair   a nd so she continued to insult him and he continued to bear itsacrifice the world for love  said she in answer to some renewed vapid declaration of his passion  how often has the same thing been said and how invariably with the same falsehoodfalsehood said he  do you say that i am false to you  do you say that my love is not real v false  of course it is false false as the father of falsehoodif indeed falsehoods need a sire and are not selfbegotten since the world began you are ready to sacrifice the world for love come let us see what you will sacrifice i care nothing for nuptial vows the wretch i think you were kind enough to call him so whom i swore to love and obey is so base that he can only be thought of with repulsive disgust in the council chamber of my heart i have divorced him to me that is as good as though aged lords had gloated for months over the details of his licentious hie i care nothing for what the world can say will you be as frank  will you take me to your home as your wife  will you call me mrs slope before bishop dean and prebendaries the poor tortured wretch stood silent not knowing what to say  what you wont do that tell me then what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice for my charmswere you free to marry i would take you to my house tomorrow and wish no higher privilege  i am free said she almost starting up in her energy for though there was no truth in her pretended regard for her clerical admirer there was a mixture of real feeling in the scorn and satire with which she spoke of love and marriage generally lam free free as the winds come will you take me as i am have your wish sacrifice the world and prove yourself a true manmr slojie should have taken her at her word she would have drawn hack and he would have hod the full advantage of the offer but he did not instead of doing so he stood wrapped in astonishment passing his fingers through his lank red hair and thinking as he stared upon her animated countenance that her wondrous beauty grew more wonderful as he gazed onjjt ha  ha ha she laughed out loud come mr slope dont talk of sacrificing the world again people beyond oneandtwenty should never dream of such a thing you and i if we have the dregs of any love left in us if we have the remnants of a passion remaining in our hearts should husband our resources better we are not in our premilre jeunesse the world is a very nice place your world at any rate is so you have all manner of fat rectories to get and possible bishoprics to enjoy come confess on second thoughts you would not sacrifice such things for the smiles of a lame ladyit was impossible for him to answer this in order to be in any way dignified he felt that he must be silentcome said shedont boody with me dont be angry because i speak out some home truths alas the world as i have found it has taught me bitter truths come tell me that i am forgiven are we not to be friends and she again put out her hand to himhe sat himself down in the chair beside her and took her proffered hand and leaned over herthere said she with her sweetest softest smilea smile to withstand which a man should be cased in triple steel there seal your forgiveness on it anil she raised it towards his face he kissed it again and again and stretched over her as though desirous of extending the charity of his pardon beyond the hand that was offered to him she managed however to check his ardour for one so easily allured as this poor chaplain her hand was surely enough by far the larger proportions of  barchester towers is ecclesiastical in its interest but we have quoted that which will show that mr trollope is not occupied only with the dialogues and dealings of church men or church matters it should be added that tom towers oracle of the jttpikr is an ally of obadiah

peveril of the peak literary notices by the author of waverley c whatever the extent of the genius and invention of the author of  waverley we know not that it is a whit moro surprising than the singular aptitude with which he stimulates attention and the felicity of manoeuvre by which he tantalises curiosity we question if a committee formed pf lotteryoffice keepers and patent medicinevenders could exercise this species of ingenuity with more dexterity  good wine says the proverb  needs no bush but it is a homely proverb and altogether out of fashion especially in scotland the convenient incognito the baffling equivoque the insinuating rumour diffused in order to be contradictedall are employed upoju system and with the success which if usually received by those who descend to such expedients in their cultivation of the art of moneygetting of these we are weary however we may feel in respect to the works the popularity of which they are intended to enhance whatever the comparative excellence of the younger offspring or of one mental bantling with another it would be futile to deny that genius abounds in the meanest of them and that tn felicity of description portraiture tf manners and spiritedness of characteristic sketching this writer always prepares a pleasant repast if not an absolute banquet it is beginning to be suspected indeed that with all the merit of the caterer the feast is more showy than substantial as also that by a light and dexterous employment of garnish and sauces the same dish is served up in a variety of disguises as thia is unavoidable in all who write much we must not complain nf it in one of the most entertaining of defaulters  nor should we have been tempted to allude to it at all but for the enacting spirit of which we have been complaininga spirit that allows mammon to make sad work with the dignity of genius and the paltry feelings of clanship to prevail over all decent attention to kindred merit past present or to come the introductory chapter to  peveril is partly the cause of the foregoing observations r fbr although jest offensive in ita artificiality than that which preceded uihih

of the author sir geoffrey peveril is a good portrait of the hospitable but despotic country gentleman of hia day abounding in feudal prejudices and a plentiful lack of brains his puritanic neighbour major bridgnorth is but so io and he somewhat unaccountably diverges from a calm man of sense into a gloomy fanatic without a sufficiency of predisposing canse for the alteration the countess of derby is raised from the dead to little purpose except to give motive to a most inexplicable villain of the name of christian whose brother she had executed for treason in her petty sovereignty of man attention is exceedingly roused by this character but it is entirely in the excitation of a curiosity by a species of unaccountable versatility which is very poorly accounted for the hero julian peveril we have already said is nobody  and his counterpart alice however lovely in description is in action nothing at all and is this ailby no means for how could the author of  waverley dispense with the agency of a something mysterious and fantastic  in the present instance the personification is peculiarly grotesque the intriguer christian has a natural daughter by a moorish female whom if we un derstand the story fright he disposes of in her infancy to a dutch tumbler but afterwards redeems on a supposition of making her useful to his purposes this girl ie ted to hekere that his executed brother is her father and in eon sequence is induced to counterfeit deafness and dumbness in which supposed state she is received as a sort of elfin attendant on the countess of derby whose destruction is sought and whose most secret intentions she thereby gets at without suspicion this feasible scheme is however defeated by her imbibing an uncontrollable penchant for julian peveril who being related to the countess ia brought up with her son the young earl of derby and in consequence thrown in the way of this mysterious attendant when therefore he is induced to take some dangerous packets to the catholic friends of the countess during the ferment created by the popish plot she attends him from time to time as a kind of esprit follet until at length we find her a woman of wit speech and spirit although doomed to love in vain and to intrigue to no purpose either for her father or herself the dark moorish yet piquant aspect the slight symmetrical person profusion of dark hair and almost supernatural agility from her education in the tumbling line altogether make up a perfect nondescript and we fear not a very happy one the general conception approaches to j extravagance and the action assigned to it is almost ridiculous only think ladies of a girt agreeing to act deafness pand dumbness for several years and to be pitied and durwarded m such by the man she adored i eran in romance there should be some verisimilitude  upon the whole we think that  peveril and  nigel jjnjr rank pea on a par although charles ii falls tar tefamd jamesil in happiness of

ruinous mill the working of which was according to their sanguine notions to sup ort the one during his law studies for that was the profession which lie had selected and the other who was intended for ti e church at college george thle elder was farmer par excellence he could read fielding or smollet but preferred his gun or planting and draining sir thomas borringdon had two daughters clara beautiful and serious and frederica buxom gay and pretty there was also a consumptive son called david who entertained strong feelings of friendship for charles and philip welstead the young people were almost constantly together and a strong attachment grew up where suchl might have been naturally expected but the various rides in which they were met did iiot filii to attract observation nor were people wanting to observe upon it to sir rhonas and lady borringdon the consequence was an immedliate rupture between the aristocratic nabob and the kindhearted old m1arcus and the departure of philip for oxford and of charles for his chamibers in london not however till after vows of ailection and constancy had been exchanged between the young people the law of nature being muade to assert

about the same time george tihe farmer married the repudiated i1arriet frodshain a dcnoitcnicnt which seems more like a desperate attempt to make all parties happy than an act of justice necessary to

pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political emergencies before his accession to the throne of england and the sole business of the story is to relate nis fortunes tn a journey to london to induce honest king james to repay it here we roust

best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in

of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all

while physically accurate is certainly imaginatively disgusting contrary however to all anticipation abe does not prove to be the heroine and the lady who is so is after all only a diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public will be extremely

the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,britain
new novels the golden bowl by henry james methuen  co thb theory of impressionism has been summed up in the dictum of monet that light is the only subject of every pioture the theory of mr henry jamess art might also be put in a formula  human thoughts are the sole material of the novelist whoever fails to realise this elementary principle is sure to come to grief in the effort to follow a master never other than difficult this principle alone accounts for the order in which events are narratedor rather they are not narrated at all they are delineated only in so far and at such times as they are producing an effect on the inward life of one of his characters conse quently they are never seen in a clear dry light such as serves to display the events of scott or even thackeray we learn them always through the refracting medium of some persons mindand that often is rather not his notion of the event in itself but his suspicion of somebody elses notion of it now this is in reality the only way in which events whether personal or historical exist for any of us a fact when it is past becomes an idea said creighton this truth forgotten alike by most novelists and nearly all historians is the justification of mr jamess method it gives us of course no ground for asserting his success but one reason why some folks give him up is that they refuse to see that he is attempting what to the best of our belief has never been attempted before even by the most psychological of novelists or poets such as browning for even brownings characters always display themselves to an audience not so with those of mr james here we are shown not the human heart under a microscope as with the ordinary analytical novelist but the soul developing itself from within finding in other persons circumstances and happenings nothing but the matter of its thought it is objected that mr james is supersubtle and trails an idea through far too many windings sets it in too many lights refines and explains and exiguates so to say ad nauseam this book will awaken this objection more than ever but let any one reflect on his thought upon any matter that concerns him personally let him take only halfanhour of it and try to retrace all its involutions and he will find himself ten times as full of distractions of strange backward twists of hesitations of reasons and imaginings as any of mr jamess characters the fact is brought out in this new book for none of the dramatis persona is at all extraordinary j the impecunious but charming italian prince who marries the daughter of a widowed american millionaire his wife his fatherinlaw and his lover the american girl of brilliant social qualities who marries the millionaire are all commonplace persons enough indeed the lack of greatness in his characterstheir essential littleness while it may enhance the realism of mr jamess work strikes us as one of its serious defects as great art the father continues so wrapped up in his daughter that the two former lovers are naturally brought together and the plot turns on a peculiarly treacherous adultery the gradual discovery of this by the princess her desire to shield her father from the knowledge of it his discovery of it and desire to shield her her success in finally severing her husband from his paramour and in securing his love are the theme of the story it is toldor to be correct it works itself out  with all the convincing realism of which mr james is a master but it is very difficult for everybody is occupied in concealing from every one else what he or she knows and even when they desire to convey the truth it is commonly done by the statement of something else the triumph of this method is shown in the scene between maggie and her father when as a result of what she omits to say the millionaire resolves to pack his traps and take his wife back for good and all to america but for the chorus work of bob assingham and his wife the whole thing would be scarcely intelligible as it is the book is clear to those who think mr james worth a little trouble the method in spite of its  inwardness is detached cold and if the word is possible a little cruel but its mental agility its likeliness its atmosphere are perfect why mr james should require so very disagreeable a situation to develop his study we cannot understand but that he has elaborated it as no one else could we are sure indeed we should have liked two more books in the novel one giving the story as it affects the mind of charlotte the brilliant hard repulsive woman and the other showing it in the mind of the millionaire strange compound of shrewdness and simplicity inexorable decision and inexhaustible kindliness mr james can hardly achieve a greater success than that of making even one of his readers desire that the book were double its length at the same time we trust that in the next book which he writes he will purge himself of certain mannerisms that are little more than affectations he overworks the word lucidity even more than writers of an earlier age did that of  sensibility he plays upon the phrase there you are as though the words were the strings of a violin he puts the commonest and most obvious expressions in inverted commas and we dislike his too frequently interrupting adverbs doubtless all are defensible as necessary on the hypothesis of the method we grant the method but deny the necessity all the same we admit that mr henry james is at his best throughout this book the final month at fawns especially the two scenes between charlotte and maggie is a veritable triumph we quote one descriptionthat in maggies mind of a cardparty   meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux  the fact of her fathers wifes lover facing his mistress  the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it upkeeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharpedged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herselfherself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played  the golden bowl uv henry james london methuen 6s mr henry james luis lure put forward the most important work in point of hulk and complexity which he has issued for some tune lt is indeed the longest novel we have of late years read elosepackeel full of matter elaborated with remarkable and meticulous precision of labour lt is no novel which he who runs may read its every page exacts of the reader concentration it must be followed with care and patience nor can the critic without much diffidence judge on ii first reading work of such a scale and prepared with so manifest su conscientious a deliberation for it is preeminently henry james and henry james of the latest tin most elitlicult refinement the plot is cunningly contrived artfully interwoven perhaps for plot we should say situation since as in all james novels it is the evolution of character under though development of a situation lilt her than plot in the usual sense which is the groundwork of the story a james situation is always subtle but this is intricately subtle so intricate in its subtlety as to intimidate iiuy attempt at brief description or analysis it is the case of ii couple an italian prince and an angloamerican girl forced into ii false position by a love affair preceding the princes marriage to an american heiress a love affair concealed from the bride who is the angloamerican girls bosom friend conceive that the latter girl afterwards marries the brides millionaire father is thus brought into permanent relation with the prince and his bride and that circumstances drift her into renewing her former connexion with the italian you then have but a part the most obvious part of the tangled web woven by mr james the interest is heightened by the fact that all the four people thus netted in domestic t rageely indeed all the chief people of the story are in their varying measure sympathetic to the reader the issue as one foreknows in a janies novel is partial and unsatisfying as life itself the emotion the tragedy though keen is never violent never fullblooded mr janies knows that inoehrn domesticity is a thing of halftints even in its suffering it bleeds but it does not bleed red the jolden bowl  is a crystal vessel cased in gold which plays ii part in the tale with somewhat ibsenlike symbolism ii crystal vessel with a secret flaw which finally shatters allegorising the character and fate of the italian prince not only in length and elaboration is this a novel which claims attention even among mr henry jamess work as the plot so is the execution subtly intricate often alas but too much so mr james later work has frequently carried his peculiar qualities to a baffling extreme and much of this book has the defects of those qualities harassingly m evidence the intellectuality overpowers the sensuous and objective traits proper to a novel until one has the impression of reading an absturse treatise of psychology rather than a tale the reader is never for a moment allowed to  take it easy he is required to be alert always and at all points even the inverted commas to which th schoolgirl looks as marking the green oases in the sands of narration betoken for lum nu relaxation of vigilance we know that in life people often answer tu each others meaning rather than to the thing actually spoken that you may have passages of dialogue wherein the actual words are but signposts pointing to the intended significance fspcially is this the case with very cultivated intelligence or vry uncultivated intelligence where the sense and habit of language is very trained or very untrained in the one case it is an art of delicate suggestion in the other a groping for expression mr meredith at his best handles this manlier of dialogue admirably so in his separate way can mr janies but in this book it is at times pushed to a nebulousness a tenuity which gives one the feeling of walking on tightropes moreover people after all talk in this way but at moments under stress of some withheld emotion impelled by som particular motive but here people often propound enigmas to each other for page after page till the wearied reader rebels then too mr james extraordinary gift in detecting and expressing though most evanescent complexities of psychological feeling subconscious or unconscious thought has seemingly become such a passion that he cannot for au instant disembarrass himself of it it overpowers his instinct of proportion he must analyse everything important r trivial with like minuteness and like prolixity thus you have page upon page in which the game is beaut ifully played but the game was really not worth thc camile nay at one point there is the we should think unparalleled exhibition of three successive chapters almost wholly engrossed by analysis and unbroken by a single conversation it is magnificent but it is scarcely novelwriting also mr janies faculty of finessing with and reducing to psychological abstractions what with any other would be the most pedestrian commonplaces of statement in association with these other things grows rather appalling to the jaded attention of the muchtried reader but his analysis in the proper place triumphs a father marries his daughters young friend mainly to satisfy his daughter ami we believe it for mr james persuades us of its truth when he does concentrate on his story there is the old power and art he is admirable in sureness and cumulative convincingness  through all the intricate evolutions and changes of emotional situation which from another hand would seem artificial as a congreve comedy he guides us with perfect persuasion of natural truth despite exasperations of detail the novel in the main is masterly the three leading women are differentiated with the nicest skill  each is living and persuasive the prince in a position somewhat recalling that of tito molema never forfeits the readers sympathy or appears less than a natively highminded man a southern min but the women are the success of the novl to analyse its charm its power is far less easy than to not its defects but it fairly ranks as a masterwork if a master work mawed by some of his obscurest later mannerisms il is not inuit for popularity but no lover of mr henry lames can neglect it without loss it is a last word of

poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,britain
our library ta b l e framley parsonage by anthony trol i lope chwpman and hall 193 piccadillyit is as yet by no means decided what a novel should be there is a growing inclination to restrict the domain of the novel within narrower and narrower bounds novels with a direct moral purpose or a historic purpose or a scientific purpose are sure to be carped at by the critics an essay they sav is the right form in which to embody these high purposes an author ought not to foist his speculations upon the public in a manner necessarily so untruthful and incomplete then tragical subjects are said to be unfit for novels io choose a tragical subject is instantly pronounced to be a mark of illtaste an intricate plot is decried as impossible in real life carefully elaborated characters are held up as burlesques of human nature altogether it will be found that unfavourable criticisms generally point to the fact that the novelwriter has aimed at too much his plot or his characters or his speculations are overdone to say that the novel shall represent without overstepping the modesty of nature real human life is no longer a sufficient definition we are beginning to restrict it within very much narrower bounds some weeks ago we read in a critical journal a definition of what the novel should be which perhaps most of our modern school of critics would accept the writer stated that the only proper subjectmatter for the novel was the manners of the time in which it was written with great ingenuity he proceeded to show bow invaluable such books would be to historians of later ages who would thus have documents ready to their hands from which to cull those historical flowvers which so pleasantly bestrew their heavier pages  tom jones was cited as an example of this orthodox novel tom jones from which book we learn that swearing was more common in those days than in these and that the lighter vices were not so strictly kept behind the veil as they now arc if we accept this definition of the novel viz that it shall represent solely the manxerg of the time in which it is written then  framley parsonage is a model novel this with the other numerous works of mr trollope will be hailed by after ages as a priceless possession from its pages the future antiquary will learn among other curious fact that the contemporaries of mr trollope were accustomed under all circumstances whether of joy or grief to dress for dinner surely mr millais when he drew that personification of crinoline representing lucy nobarts in state of woe was in au humour of grim satire there could nqt be a better emblem of the book than this picture the pretty woeful face and claspd hands and jjtj pen4ant foot though this must be bloto4 id a godw breaker fashion squeezed into odd corners to give due prominence to that mountain of flounces are as the touches of real human nature which mr trollope has sparsely scattered on the ourskirts of his huge mass of conventionalism the story turns upon the inconveniences caused by a billacceptance and the disquiets arising from a loveaffair between a rich lord and the sister of his parsonfriend the bill with all its attendant expenses does not exceed a thousand pounds mark robarts who accepts it has an income of fifteen hundred ayear moreover all his friends are rich and are eager to lend him or to give him the thousand pounds in question one does not quite see why the affair should end in bailiffs taking possession of the parsonage furniture save that the exigencies of the story demand that little piece of excitement and that a moral is thus pointed how very much more shocking it is for a clergyman to suffer such misfortune than a layman with regard to the lovepassage between lucy robarts and lord lufton the only difficulty is that lady lufton his mother is supposed to be hostile to the match lucy will not accept ludovic until the consent of his mother is gained the mother never could or did refuse ludovic anything and so when he asks her to consent to the marriage she does consent why lucy should so often enter upon the scene woebegone in crinoline does not sufficiently appear there are the usual questions of conscience in the bookthe struggaes between duty and pleasure which lie at the bottom of all human stories here these take the form of casuistries as to what a parson ought to do or ought not to do how far may he act against the wishes of his patroness ought he to visit a bachelorduke does the presence of his bishop with him in questionable society render that society innoxious to himself  mtay he ride to the meet with a friend and if so may he cross one field after the hounds and if one how many more by how much its the wickedness of having anything to do with a bill increased by the party being clerical instead of lay we know of old that mr trollope takes a great interest in the clergy he tells us some where in this story with a somewhat grandiloquent gravity that his mission towards them extends only to consideration of their social relations not of their parish or diocese business we are glad his mission is so far limited in another place he hints that he has a scheme for the equalising of ecclesiastical incomes which scheme would seem to us to be an interference with ecclesiastical business in its most sacred point however we are spaed the unfolding of his scheme in  framley parsonage and so we have only to look at mr trollopes mission according to his own proclamationa mission to satirise gently the  social relations of the clerg  spare the rod and spoil the child quoth solomon and mr trollope when after mild castigation lie relegates this child to a fools cap and the corner performs these severities ostensibly with an eye to the chiids good we have often wondered w hat lie purposes in these constant inild satires we get always now in his hooks a flourish of trumpets when he is going to trot out a pearson isle has acbievel fame for that trick and it is always printed in his bills in the largest letters mr trollope in his famous act of parsonship is received with loud applause at the threshold of the arena and probably hisses would follow if hle substitutel any other performance for that timehonoured one tlhe lady  e art of his audience especially aplreciate this poking of fun at their pastors bishop proudie turned into an old panrtaloon is meat and drink to titem the wickedness of making fun of a bi8shop gives an exquisite edge to their delight we could understand that applause of this per forinance would make mr rollope repeat it also that habit would make limn repeat itit nust be very easy to do what he has been doing for half a life but when we find limn gravely hinting a high moral purpose in these exhibitions andl referring to his labours past and to come as giving him a claim to the gratitude of his countrymen we recur with double force to our old wondermentwhat is his object  is he a special enemy or a special friend to the parsons  did a parson ever injure him or are all his relations in the church does he think the parsons the only men worth warning in this wvicked age or does he think them the only men foolish enough and defenceless enough to he lashed by satire  or is it that he has some natural sympathy or antipathy anent them  some men are strongly affected by a cat or the singing i the nose of a bagpipes any how the parsons would be well rid of him that the question of parsondom in its social as well as its other relations is a difficult one and becoming more and more difficult yearly is pretty generally acknowledged but poking gentle fun at the manners and customs of the clergyman will not hell towards a settlement of the question it has long ago been pointed out that the pet parson holds as it were an intermediate position between the sexes male and femalehe is a weaker man he is a stronger woman and it is against this emasculate condition which has been forced upon our priest hood graduallynow by rampant platitudinarianismn now by rampant attitudinarianismthat our muscularians have risen in revolt such discussions as mr rollope brings forwardhow far a clergyman is justified in putting himself in the way of contaminationwhether his virtue is pure enough to resist seduction and strong enough to repel ravishmentwhether the pharisaical attitude of gathering ones garmelits about one is not the most becoming and the safest attitude for himsuch discussions take for granted the semifeminity of the clergy and propose only to decide what precise cross between breeches and crinoline would be their most fitting garb another novelist is fond of touching upon this parson questiontouching upon it in its social light and in an humorous manner if mr trollope cannot get cured of his itch parsonwards he would do well to study george eliots treatment of the subject to return to the hypothesis of manners being the proper subject of the novel accepting this we must inquire what manners are in the sense of our definition manners are the conventional habits of society society lives in london for so many months of the year at countryteats for so many hunts in leicestershire during this season fish in norway during that shoots in scotland or travels on the continent during another society has its boxes and stalls at the opera its entrance into certain houses it consists of lords and commoners anl of some few out of the lower world who gain admittance into society by reason of their great wealth higher dignitaries of the church are in society and during the countryseat season parishparsons gain entrance on a lower footing sometimes an apothecary or a lawyer is heard of there lbut either is sure to have a ludicrous name and a burlesque manner ladiesmaids and foot men and grooms play the broadly comic parts speaking a language peculiar to themselves alone the countryseat has its attendant village and so we hear of robin postman and mrs podgerss baby the town has terrible dens upon its outskirts whither wild young men resort and so we are introduced to the tozer family society consists of a few thousand people who all agree to live much in the same way and to do the same things probably among these few thousands there is genuine tragedy and farce enough to form the basis of as heartmoving a human story as has ever been written animal hetties and mystical dinabs godfrey casses devotees of favourablechance and silas marners godstricken we have them all in those higher walks of life made by the same maker creepitig on the same earth different only in that their clothes are finer and their grammar more precise but then these deeper commotions of life never rise to the smooth surface of mlanner lovesick lucy wears innumerable flounces and the flounces are the chief business of our novelist we want description of the savages warpaint not speculations as to his thirst for blood to say that there are no touches of nature in framley parsonage wvould be untrue but we do say that they are almost lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming floods of conventionality lucy is pleasantly drawn and sometimes her satiric utterances against herself express as well as can be her bitterness of heart thedevotion of mrs robarts in the bailiffscene is touching the spice of poetry that exists in sowerby gains instant acknowledgment in every heart as true the pride of crawley in its first conception is excellent but then fmr trollope has chosen to burlesque it with his flippant wit there are passages in this book so truthful so pathetic so humourous that they move those who are not admirers of the author to a tenfold impatience of the mass of twaddle in which they are buried the standard which the story sets up for itself is a false one there are no men and women in  framley parsonage  they are never viewed as men and women but only with regard to their relations to society the only conscience in the book is what will the world say the only morality  such conduct does not become such a position unfrock mark robarts anrd he does not exist deprive lord lufton of his title mliss dunstable of her wealth and they cease to be no doubt the accidents of life affect inen greatly but men do exist apart from these accidents we can take hetty strip her of her lowcly circumstances and raise her to the rank of a lady and she will remain the same hetty in maggie tulliver we have the very type of a nature always at war with the circumstances encompassing it but can we imagine lucy robarts lowercd to the station of hetty  does she not disappear entirely when we take from her her educated sharpness of tongue and her conventional notions of propriety  it is because mr frollopes characters are not men and women hut effects of given circumstances only that be errs so greatly in bringing them again and again upon the stage he has not the wonderful talent to show a beatrix esmond developed into a baroness bernstein  i   we have said enough about mr trollope to show that we differ from all the world in our estimate of his novels he is now perhaps the most popular of our modern novelists his name heaven save thc mark is coupled with the toast of english literature at literary dinners is novelwriting the highest branch of literature  and have we no dickens or thackeray to represent it if it is rumour promises us another novel from his hand in the pages of the cornhill his orley farm illustrated by an artist once our first is on every drawingroom table mnr trollope is at the height of his fame we prophesy that he will live to see his novels rated at their worth that we should return to an admniration of the fashionable novel long since buried beneath worthier fictions now resuscitated in all its flimsy flippancy is not a good sign ja i  rr tile literary examiner 7 itklei i unonage by anthony trollope author of  barchester towers c c with six illustrations by t e millais ra in three volumes smith elder and co the warden and barchester towers are the only novels of mr trollopes better than framley parsonage it has been said that every man if he could write it has one good novel in bin barchester tower is a sequel to the warden and framley parsonage is an appendix to them both it is in as far as they resemble the warden that the sequel and appendix claim preeminence because they contain the particular novel that seems to have been according to this notion in mr trollope or that which it was in his nature to write better than another man however superior he might be in genius could have written it his sketches of clerical life are his own when writing upon other topics he is always clever lively and observant but the limits to his power are more clearly manifest mr anthony trollope is not in the highest sense a man of genius in all his works best and worst perhaps there is not a touch of original fancy as far as it is possible for a no ve 1st to be without invention he is without it there is nc ingenuity in the construction of his stories the sketches of character on which they depend for their value are the result of shrewd observation cleverly expressed in everyday phrase never of any subtle or peculiar insight into character a remark that a square forehead expresses intelligence rather than thought or that most eyes are green may be said to represent the utmost stretch of mr trollopes subtlety these are such individual opinions and notes of observation as one may hear daily from a b c and d at any dinnertable without wondering at a b c or ds profundity but they are always lively and clever in expression always therefore acceptable again in the inability to represent strong passion mr trollope shows his want of the insight that belongs to genius the passion of lucy hobarts in framley parsonage when she pours out her secret misery of a baulked love to her sisterinlaw is an example of this she speaks of herself as having been  bowled over like a ninepin when she was so sure that she  should never be missish and spoony and sen ti  mental calls herself an unutterable ass and so forth all which is of course very manly and preserves the author from all risk of being himself considered to write spoony love passages but it does not represent the passion of a woman even when she as lucy is here doing hysterically mocks at her own grief there is no want of hearty feeling in the book a healthy human sense of what he has fairly seen and entered into with full understanding in the course of life is no mean part of the strength of this as of all mr trollopes novels the author is no doubt too much at the usual level of society in observation and expression to admit of pathos in his writings they do not even contain any flashes of the wit with which not a few men who do not write are able to enliven social intercourse but when he is at home with his subject and it represents a cause that has his sympathy mr trollopes clear expression of a wholesome human feeling makes its wsy home to the readers heart there is force then snd there is some force everywhere in the literalness on which he depends necessarily for his power as a novelist the literalneeb let it be leceembered of a thoroughly quickwitted and observant man mr tieheee is et his heat we hewe laid when writs of the clergy not of the bench of bishops for his bishop is a feeble caricature but of the leaser dignitaries of the cathedral close their wives and daughters and not of these only as framley parsonage shows the picture of mark roberts the young country rector too early possessed of a good living who is tempted into the fast set of country society beguiled by an embarrassed county member and led through weakness of character to risk the very existence of a home to which he is attached j with his whole heart is excellent the domestic sulo ofhis nature is well kept in view and even when ho  known in thc county as a hunting parson we ay mario to understand together with his weakness the dornotio qualities and the religious nature underlying p the sketch of the generous impulsive wife and a nr rc el ornate study of the not less generous friend and neighbour tidy j lufton patroness of the living whose son was marks j schoolfellow and is his friend are simply fault ss the j little weaknesses and the great strength of a relined womanly nature in lady lufton thc simple and iojd j hearted prejudices the pleasant airs nf patronage always a part of the true dignity with which she is inviterthe1 generous conquests of prejudice and temper and though gentle j sacrifices that come of the love ot a widow ibr her on iv son are combined in the character of lady linton with i deli  cacy of touch that is perhaps only the more admirably true j and effective for that literalness of manner upon which we have just dwelt lord luftonher handsome and good1 natured son who falls for a short time into the hands of i the philistines and mr sowerby the embarrassed county i member whose estates are mortgaged to whom little bills are a necessity of daily life and who with unprincipled goodnature never with malice ruins himself and swindles his friends represent also thoroughly well certain forms of life the weakest parts of the book are those which affect political satire the meeting at gatherum castle  all that relates to the immensity of tom towers to the jupiter and to mr harold smith who becomes lord petty bag or to the parliamentary struggle described as a contest between the gods and giants is feeble and confused the blending of false names of party leaders with the most resent dates the triviality of the particular alludion sometimes blended with a clumsy and exaggerated general satire represent the defective side of mr trollopes literalness it may please some readers to congratulate themselves on their own cleverness in identifying with lord brougham the lord boanerges who explains the philosophy of soap bubbles to mis dunstable at that assembly at gatherum castle about which the readers curiosity was raised only to bc disappointed utterly but mr trollope makes visible no reason that he could have had in art as a writer or in politics as a satirist for an introduction of lord brougham in that place neither is the passing sketch of him in any respect clever this criticism applies to everything that may have been meant for political satire in framley parsonage the chapter on the triumph of the giants is kindred in its affectation and clumsiness to some of the classical chapter headings and to the silly opening of the penultimate chapter entitled nemesis by introducing nemesis as  peen a that just but rhadamanthine goddess  whom we moderns ordinarily call

windsor castle tues exhibition of drawing by mr joseph nash of a sefies of twentyfive views of the interior and exterior of windsor castle has during the last ten days attracted many visitors to mr mleans in the haymarket who has announced them for pub lication in lithography executed by the artist and accompanied by descriptive letterpress the plan resembles a good deal that of the  royal palaces by pyne published many years ago at very great expense but which was too far extended to be remausrative in the present case the limit to one palace is judicious and when we look at its gor geous furniture and embellishments and also the interesting occasions on which the curtain is drawn up to exhibit acts of grand court ceremonies and banquets we see there is enough to impart sufficient variety to the selection though made from a single royal residence mr nash has executed the de signs with great skill and effect his interiors are exceedingly rich and where perspective is required he has achieved a far more than common success several of the external scenes with moonlight or in the brightness of day possess the beauty of line landscapes and others are enlivened by military parade promenades and festive entertainments it is unnecessary to go farther into particulars and we shall merely add that the exhibition is well worth a visit and promises a graphic work of

rein mistress and the day ot her beheading the tale has a striking opening and a startling close a grand procession rich and various in character and painted with that minuteness and animation in which this writer so excels ushers in the queenelect and a solitary human figure still more pictiresque fills the last scene  it is that of henry who with a fierce tumult raging in his breast is gazing at noontide on the 19th of may from tile woods below his castle upon the round tower whence as by previous arrangement of a line of signals froin the place of extcution a sigrnal gun is tired

upon this hint our new historian has wrought wonders and henceforth the fiend of the forest herne with his broken chain and antlered brow will le as easily identified anmong the grim forms that people the imagination as his own oak was amontg the venerable trees of windsor we propose to levote what space may be spared to the history of this imiuperishable hunter as here related by honest hector cutbeard the clerk of the kings kitchen the broken rattling chain and the wild stags head must have perplexed many and many an explorer of old romance and raised a curiosity that never had a chance of being grattihied till now briefly thien about the middle of richard iids reign a young mtti mnimed 1ferne flourished as one of the keepers of the forest his wonderful expertness and devotion to the chase drew upon him royal notice and with his two black hounds ot st huberts breed lie was the kings attendant as eften as a hart was to be chased whether the boar the badgler the otter or the fox was the object of sport lierne was equally dexterous but his jealous comrades hated himn one day a desperate hart standing at bay the king who was separated from h1is attendants was in imminent antger of death herne saved him by receiving the hurt himself and slew the beast osmonde crook the chief keeper tenderly proposed as hie drew his huntingknife to put the suifferingr youth  out of his misery  but the gratful king offered a large reward for his cure  on which there siddenliv sprang forward a tall dark manl on a wildlooking steed illilip urswick by name and engagred to perform what all lse despaired f lie cut off the head of the dead hart close to the point where thie neck joined the skull and then laid it open from the extremity of the tinder lip to the nuike and ordered it to be bound on thle head of the wvounded man the keepers wvere afraid lest lhe should recover anl the misterious surgeon offered them revenge on ocondition thnt they swore to grant if they could his first request tlle compact was made herne recovered was enriched and honoured by the king and appointedl chiefkeeper but alas  he had lost all his skill as an archer all his raft as a hunter  his horse threw him on the first expedition tle keepetrs eyed limn askance he was last in the chase and the king laughed at him as out of practice but gave him a chance by biddim hinm bring lowi a buck seventy yards off ilerne raised his crossbow but the bolt missed its mark angother trial was assigned him by the king but the arrow quivered in the trunk of a tree at some distance from the bird aimed at the kings brow grew dark the next ly llerne practised as he thought in secret but his enemies watched and saw that not a shaft would go truehie had lost his mnstery also over horse and hound he went forth with the king to hunt and augin his failures provoked mirth  but the king pitied him and gave hin a weeks repose for further trial ere lhe deprivel poor ilerne of his office the unhappy keeper when he quitted the royal presence rode oft into tle forestdepthls where he remained till nightfall and then returned with ghaistlv lookswith the links of a rusty chain 1lucked from a gibbet hangrjing from his left arm and the harts antlered skull fixed like a helm upon his head lie was crazedfranticbut his wild antics excited laugrhter instead of compassion he presently disappeared agrain amidst the trees iil the 11ome park and in an hour afterwards a pedlar crossing from ldatchett founnl the forlorn and brainistruck keeper suspended tfom a branch ot that oaktree wvhich for centuries since has born his name  when the kinirs servants hurried to the spot the body was gone and the rope only was swinging froin the branch that night there was a terrible thunderstorm and the very oakthiencefuorward to be

their scent and his falcon would not be lured back each in turn who supplied his llace incurrel the samie ban and the keepers went in a body to consult ujrswick who warned the wretched mhenl that hlernes blood was up10on them alnd bade thenll repair to the oak onl whichi he died there at midnight through the itchy darkness they descried tile iwhite scathed branch of the tree and by a flitting

fearful imprecations when lie vaulted on his horse crying to the forest  and dashed forward like a hurricane the whole party hounds and horses hurryitn after him ilere in the forest lie performed some incantation and urswick appeared and welcomed herine andl emanded of his comirades the fulfilment of their promise to granit his first reluest i e called onl them toform a band for ilerne the hunter and to serve lilii as leader not daringr to refuse the keepers took the oath a stag was instantly unharboured and a wvild chase commenced which lasted until ain hour before daybreak night after night they assembled for the salie purpose at the scathed oak until the kingr hearing of their widl outrages and depredations determined to go forth at nidliuight with a numerous guard into the forest the royal party encountered lherne at the oak and the demonhunter in reply to the kings demand denounced thle kings keepers as the wretches by whose malice an infernal spell had been laid upon him  hang them upon this tree he exclaimed  and i will trouble the woods no more while thou reignest the keepers then prostrated themselves before the king confessing their guilt they were hanged upon the scathed tree and the appeased spirit of herne was seen no more during rtichards reignll thus endeth mr ainsworths inimitable legend of the hunter how he appeared in after reigns especially how he appeared in the eighth harrys time as registered herein is a continuation of the tale of wonders worthy the beginning there is however another version touiching his being tempted by the fiend through a fair nun whona he carries off and slays in a jealous fit destroying himself afterwards in remorse and this lovetale is here taken advantage of herne being devoutly smitten with the pure and simple charins of a forest maiden mabel lyndwood whose father is a keeper leagued with the demon she has a second lover in fenwolf another ot ihernes crew a character powerfully marked  a third in thenry himself whose adventures and disguises in her behalf are lightly and bioyantly described and a fourth even in the fond and passionate wyatt whose heart mabel almost weanis at length from the hopeless unrequited love of anne boleyn but only to leave it by an untimely and piteous death more despondin and desolate than ever another source of tender and rentle interest is in the wooing and wailing the bright love and the gloomy lot of the fair geraldine lady elizabeth fitzgerald the sweet inspirer of the poetical ireams of surrey whose nature and bearing like those of wyatt are strongly but grasce

wood which with the wild horseman and his hapless burden mniabel wvhont lie is bearing to destruction both author and artist have so brilliantly and terrifically described as the hunter is now surrounded by the treachierous flames from which hie nevertheless escatpes so do the mortal persons of the story seem shut in and surroundcd by the supernatural agency wvhich affects them all more or less and vhileh seems to be rightly ascribed to a time and a country when such outraoges atrainst law and justice morals and religion could be practised by the chief magistrate of the land with

hidden deptjis hidden depths edinburgh  edmonston and douglas what most characterises our age and will we are proud to say raise it to  transcendental glory for ever is the discovery made of the royal road to everything there is nothing new under the sun but there are plenty of persons quite ready with a new  healall  for every ancient sore  yet morally the world remains much the same but whence is this selfreliant spirit  is it a bold attempt of the human intellect to apply the latest discoveries in science to itself  is spiritualism an attempt to make the body ny like the mind i is mesmerism electrifying matter through the brain which is only an electrical machine 1 is tableturning owing to the magnetic force of the nature we possess  we have often thought over the ingenious contrivance of the great baron munchausen for igniting his pistol by striking his eyes till they flashed fire we wonder that no one has patented this device  surely  every man his own lucifermatch  would be a good advertisement medical men tell us that madness may result from overmuch railway travelling  so that we must not be too sanguine in anticipating still more power accruing to the human mind from its connexion with the newborn wonders of the physical world religion too as well as science has its high pressure if electricity and steam have revolutionised the world has not revivalism awakened a torpid age  there is however this sad distinction that where science utilises gradually her inventions and becomes a blessing to the community the coal oil and tar heaped on by the more ardent racers in religion surely eventuate in an explosion the hidden depths  are for a moment revealed but the dark waters soon close over the wreck and life is as deceitfully calm on the surface as ever that most royal road of all the millennium is we are informed expected shortly to solve all the trials and difficulties of the middleaged who see no other way to extricate them from the complications with which they are entangled the young we are afraid are hardly prepared to exchange all the freshness of life even for such a consummation of their hopes setting aside this periodical sensation which is continually cropping up unexpectedly there are plenty of other evidences of the brilliant success we have met with in macadamizing the intellectual and moral as well as the scientific world we detest anything slow we are not certain that the  arabian nights  is not one of the most truthful books we retain in our library works on theology seem to be getting more and more dull they want to destroy all sensations and reduce us to believe nothing but what we see we enjoy for our part these sensations  life would be stale watercress without them we go to the theatre to hear singers and behold dancers but unless the one can scream louder and longer and higher than a railway whistle and the other keep both legs in the air for several seconds together we are terribly bored we rejoice to find these audacious jumps at popularity in novel writers our preachers and their sermons are wfullv stuetd o4jf want to become coodin mmmldfakiond  way lei uh gdeg aw y we it is so wslsoolearly revealed to one in ones own armaair we indeed can assure our friends th nothing more beneficial to their amour proper than to be able while reading these delightful discourses to fold ones hands and shake ones head and sigh with a comfortahlebense of our goodness over the scenes of depravity therein depicted let any one attain to the higher degrees of crime and mingle ferocity with a bland demeanour he or she is straightway pounced upon and decorated with the star of the legion of honour having caught your criminal fresh from the gallowslay figures are tameyou must hold him up as a pattern of misguided virtue it is for the welleducated and wellborn of society that you must prepare your tabl and whet your scalpel these are your real criminals to whom you must show no mercy as for the worthless they are so much more interesting they must be acquitted  it is society which deserves the gibbet with regard to the st le it must be clear and terse brimful of nice contrasts and teeming with delicate sentiment you must take original views of things or your novel will be flat learn something of surgery  you must have attended a great many sayings out or your descriptions will not horrify perhaps only provoke a laughand then your book will take perhaps the best method for stopping any unseemly cachinnation is to make religion ancillary to your general design just as one sacred song is put by way of grace at the head of a programme of secular music besides nothing spices so much to the publie taste as quotations from the bible did not the swearing club obtain a still more exhilarating spirit amongst the london casuals from this skilful use of religion in sober earnest although a writer may profess in tike preface the most exalted views  and the most zealous desire for doing good v if we find the subject made agreeable and witty we must crave permission to doubt not the intention but the moral value of the work ffidendepths  professes to deal with the social evil but we fear takes much too onesided a view of the question for its cure we cannot deny that the work is well written and interesting  and sets the cure in a true light so far as seduction is concerned no one can regard this crime with too great horror the delicacy of the female sex once removed and it really seems as if nothing were left to it of that shrinking modesty or of that tender selfsacrificing affection so peculiar to women we hold with the writer of  hidden depths that no punishment can be too severe for the wilfui coldblooded seducer of innocence  bat then we require first to be satisfied of the innocence we cannot help feeling that very little account is made of the sin itself by the writer we are told with truth that the social evil is hardly held as a sin by the lower class supposing then that the offender held up to our execration in this novel instead of deserting his victim had pensioned her off before his marriage to another the novel could not have continued to choose what we hope is an extreme case for our inspection is not the best plan for preventing the fate of thousands of women which occurs from far more ordinary causes what are the statistics of seduction and of what the writer would connect with it suicide  take country villages as a test and a fair one in this case as the author describes his unfomunates as innocent country girls w have known an instance of a labourer wjfafe applied to his clergyman for help towwsib the maintenance of his illegitimate child alleging that it was the custom of the bjjfj teadeavosr to secure husbands by mwfig uaeof acode of honour long estahlinmd £ig the lowest classnamely that if m mm had two illegitimate children mt mmmmm f th sass mother it was then his duty to marry her one such birth was not held sufficient cause again working in the fields is another fruitful source of contamination  the language and conduct of the married women being beyond measure vile we write it in sorrow  but the  innocent abodes of the poor with eight or ten persons of various ages sleeping in one bedroom do not yet exist vanity love of dress the desire of a life of excitement proved by female servants declining what they consider dull places the spread of light literature speaking slightingly of such connexions between rich and poorsuch as these are the real sources of the evil among such a class you will not find many who are goaded by excess of feeling or remorse to commit suicide the statistics of suicide prove that the most trifling causes such as sudden passion or illtemper will induce persons to destroy themselves what a terrible indifference to infanticide does the now celebrated case of the devonshire murderess discloseand by the way we have her photograph in hidden depths we now give a sketch of the story the heroine ernestine courtenay is engaged in the search for the sister of a girllois brook seduced by colonel courtenay her brother the girl lois brook commits suicide on being deserted and leaves a letter imploring the colonel to save her younger sister annie from a like melancholy end ernestine who is engaged to a mr lingard sets out with his permission on the search for annie brook who has been also seduced and cast off by her lover the tale shows us the social difficulties which meet ernestine in her mission she finds out the parents of the two girls  the father refuses to take back his child fearing the disgrace and loss of his place as lodgekeeper in a noblemans park  the mother gives a portrait of annie and a clue to the place where she is ernestine meets with a rebuff from lady carleton in asking permission for annies return to her fathers home she then goes to greyburgh university where her brother keginald is residing there she finds her brother dying and in a state of great mental trial from infidel views instilled into him by his college tutor two clergymen are introduced  the first is rector of the oarish in which annie brook is living a o dr granby is horrified at the notion of permitting a profligate to come near his house a good deal of wit is made out of his excuses for not seeking the lost he recommends ernestine to give up the search and to engage herself in real works of charity such as teaching an infant school  to clap their hands in unison or to imitate his daughter marie who leads c our little choir in term time when several of the collegians assist at our services and can appreciate our musical efforts we must here confess our surprise at any clergyman of a large parish represented as being so ludicrously indifferent to the cases of unfortunate girls of whose existence in visiting the poor he must continually be reminded and actually brought into contact with on their sick beds the other clergyman a mr thorold is represented as fully engaged in all the usual parish work of nightschools reformatories c as the book is published in scotlaud we hope that it is simply ignorance on the part of the author as to the conduct of the parish clergy who all more or less must meet with many cases connected with the social evil annie brook is at last found and persuaded to enter a reformatorythe discipline of which is too severe for her  she runs away but prefers rather to starve than to have recourse to the streets again she dies in the hospital but before her death recognises and forgives her first seducer lingard he of course is disclaimed for ever by ernestine who gives herself up to the work of recovering lost females we are treated to four deaths in the book three minutely described and the bodies properly laid out we find a great deal of poetical description as well as sentimental writing all the unfortunates are beautiful mis guided impulsive and affectionate we cannot think that the work although well written and interesting is quite in character with the very serious preface which informs us that the work is not one of fiction for  though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records much of the social evil is attributed teyoung men at the universityboys really of from sixteen to eighteen about whom the girls of the town congregate no doubt but innocent young women are not seduced out of the villages near as the author would indicate the language and turn of thought put into the mouths of the unfortunates are by no means true to nature as the author states in the work the sin itself is but lightly regarded among the poor they would therefore be very unlikely to speak or think even as here represented we cannot get over the feeling that the author more reprobates the desertion than the seduction of females the remarks about the overseverity of reformatories are good  but we cannot forget the overtenderness which lets loose ticketofleave men on the public the real fact is that if half the interest were displayed toward our poorest class before they become so interesting through sin and crime we should be fostering that sympathy between class and class which mr justice talfourd in his last charge declared to be so sadly wanting far more than by endeavouring to cure the evil after its spread the social evil will never be healed by novel writers however talented they may be the attack must not be made on human nature but on those evils which render that nature so weak and are thus the causes of the mischiefviz ignorance and the crowded dwellings of the poor and the poverty which makes them regard money as the sole good in life to be obtained at all hazards there are many landed proprietors even in mucliabtised dorset who are heartily working for the good of the poor by building cottages with more bedrooms the wages are also fixed at a higher rate by those gentlemen with the same objectthat of improving the moral condition of the labourers on their estates all this must be a work of time  and after all we cannot expect that the social evil can be ever eradicated until the whole world is in a far different state from what we now behold when there is no longer any more dishonesty or violence or deceit there will also be no more profligacy meanwhile if the efforts of philanthropists are directed not to exciting morbid sympathy towards the poor but to teaching men more selfrespect they will materially lessen the social evil  hidden depths tiim1 authoress of this very remarkable book writes with vehement earnestness taking for the motto of her work the axiom  verita4 ea major charitas  but we are sorry to say that her earnestness is in excess of her judgment and that what she takes for absolute truth is but a very limited part of a great and complex whole still though we are compelled for the truths sake to pass this apparently sweeping censure upon her work we are equally compelled to bear witness to the high intention with which she has laboured the extraordinary circumstance of a delicate pious and intellectuallygifted woman writingeven anonymouslyon the subject of the  social evil is in itself enough to bespeak respectful attention for her book but in addition the writer of  hidden depths is entitled to special consideration for the striking literary power she exhibits in the present volumes had she contented herself with writing an ordinary novel in which the sin of seduction was held up to the reprobation and scorn of all rightminded readers we are sure she would have deserved to be recognised as worthy of a conspicuous place in the ranks of contemporary english novelwriters she has chosen however to write with a purpose and we might almost say has courted failure for the admiration which hidden depths is well calculated to inspire so long as it is considered in the light of a work of fiction is turned to objection when the story with its narrow bounds and partial exhibition of facts has to be viewed as the exposition of a gigantic social disorderthe most saddening difficult not to say hopeless problem of civilised life 4 though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records in this sentence taken from the authoresss preface we detect the error which underlies the whole argument of her book what happens mostly in the case of those who act upon mere philanthropical impulse has happened in her case having become possessed of a few facts she has taken them as representing the whole truth of the subject on which they bear it is clearly to be inferred from her book that she believes seductionthat is to say the systematic ruin of perfectly innocent girls by heartless profligatesto be one of the chief causes of the vice in question but how utterly without foundation such a belief must be is known to every one who has ventured to inquire into the subject at all it is most probable that the writer of  hidden depths  has heard the story of the happy home the perfect innocence the advent of the betrayer the faill from virtue the abandonment and all the other incidents related by some reclaimed unfortunate the mistake she has made is in having given a too ready credence to a relation which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred is found upon searching inquiryr to be wholly or in great part untrue of the poor wretches who qualify themselves to take the distinctive title of unfortunates it is almost certain that not ten in a thousand adopt that miserable calling from the cause assigned by her we need not recapitulate the score of wellascertained causes and we will only say that they have been found enough to daunt the boldest seekers for a remedy the authoress of  hidden depths thinks she has only to take her bible in hand and the cure is found through the lips of her heroine she cries in answer to the objection that she is possibly compromising herself in attempting to reclaim one only out of a tribe better ignored altogether  one onlybut that one an immortal soul that never in all the eternal ages can cease to live and living to suffer if in the whole world there is not enough of compassion found to save her from a doom of such unitnagined horror one only but that one unspeakably precious in the sight of the god who made her for himself that we know his beloved son would have come down from heaven to die in his awful agony for her alone had she only of all the human race been perishing and sinful you speak of thousands like her is it not enough to crush ones very soul with horror to think of what they are in the sight of the righteous heaven and shall be probably for ever  and the thought that it is their own fellowcreatures who have thus blasted their souls with eternal ruin makes one wonder that god ehould still withhold the fire which one day must justly bu to ashes a world so cruel and so polluted and cm you think hugh that apart from the judgement which will fall upon the active agents in the ruin of the thousands of whom you speak there will be no account demanded of their blood from those who were passive instruments in their destruction who might have helped who might have saved them and would not  on such as i am who ought to be ready to give my whole life to win all and any i could am i to abstain from rescuing one one actually given into my hand because some painful humiliation some bitter thence may come to wound my vanity from those who make this worlds approval the idol of their worship oh what will all that wrlnd be to me wpi am lyidg cold and stiff in the grave whence there in no reaw  how much more then wctthless in that silent time of waiting wiu be its praise or blamthe praise or blame of those who will be dust and ashes ike myself but will not the doom of that owe lost soul be eveythiu to mete 0u1l that will meet me at e baer afjand out egieist m idden depths two vdojuxl u uin md dools6 you might have saved me and you did not therefore you are my condemnation you are my sentence you are my everlasting despair   we give this passage as a specimen of the authoresss style and as affording at the same time an indication of her enthusiastic unpractical view of the subject with which she has undertaken to deal in the course of her narrative however occasional remarks will be foundwith reference to homes for fallen women and analogous institutions for exampleindicative of a large capacity for actual work it appears hard to say that what she has done has been useless labour but the most we can hope from it is that it may serve to set thinking some who never thought before of this ugly side of their social existence by all means let anything and everything that can be done be done to save individual souls by earnest doers like the authoress of  hidden depths the more closely the subject of the social evil is looked at by intelligent women the more likelihood is there of means being found to mitigate the abomination it is beyond doubt in the power of women to give a purer tone to society by doing their best to discountenance all profligacy of life in the men of their own families as well as those with whom they are otherwise brought into contact at present nothing of the kind is done and so long as no  inconvenience results even notorious impurity of life is held to be no disqualification for a man in society indeed the man of many mistresses is an object of special interest and regard with thousands of women who would affect the utmost horror and indignation at being brought into personal relationship with any woman of sullied reputation but these remarks apply only to the upper classes among the lower classes where the horrors of the social evil spread widest it is useless to think of any such ameliorating influence as that which it is possible for the women of the superior classes to exert the authoress of  hidden depths  takes no account of unfortunates below the grade of gentlemens abandoned mistresses or of the mercenaries of university towns and in saying this perhaps we say enough to show that her earnestness has been spent upon a mere fragment or two of the innumerable wrecks that strew the deadsea shore of this miserable subject we are glad however to recognise in her present work signs of an admirable literary faculty read as a work of fiction we are sure that  hidden depths  will not fail to interest thoughtful readers far beyond the average of the seasons new novels,britain
not wisely but too well new novels by the author of cometh up as a flower 3 vols tinsley brothers we suspect that this book is written by the author of  guy livingstone from its peculiar heroes and very peculiar morality in fact guy livingtone himself under the name of col stamer is here again introduced to the public with his old characteristicshi3 gigantic strength and form fascinating manners and delightful wickedness  so that if this book is not written by the novelist we have mentioned we can only say that the author is guilty of very decided plagiarism and has allowed his admiration of the model to mislead him into imitating his master  not wisely but too well we sincerely hope our original suspicion is correct for we should bo very sorry to see two writers of ability pandering to the gross tastes of the day by writing such books as guy livingstone and  not wisely but too well the great object of books like these is apparently to teach immorality by representing it in an interesting and seductive form and by making good people who live according to the ordinary laws of decency appear tame stupid and despicable at any rate if this is not their object wo can assure their authors that it must inevitably be their effect this has been pointed out time after time but still we find these books being written and published and the almost unanimous voice of rebuke and morality despised and neglected it is time then for critics to speak out boldly and to declare in plain language what they think of the tendencies of these books and see by so doing whether they cannot put a stop to their production now this may seem to some very strong language but it is not stronger than the occasion requires if any one doubts this let him take the book we are now reviewing and read it coolly and critically and ask himself at the end what is its tendency and what impression on the mind of an ordinary reader it is calculated to produce we distinctly affirm that in this novel all the personages who do not continually break the commonest laws of society are made to appear uninteresting and foolish as if though only reason for a man not being a profligate was a want of spirit or an absence of ability while all the art of the writer is lavished on the herocol stamer whose wickedness we are frankly told cannot be exceeded and in making this man obtain the morbid sympathy of the reader as he obtains the passionate love of the heroine a short sketch of the tale will do more perhaps to reveal the nature of this book than all our animadversions the hero colonel dare stamer loves and is equally beloved by miss kate chester the heroine an extraordinarily beautiful and clever girl and before the colonel knew her a very ladylike and modest one this colonel is but guy livingstone again we take his description from the very words of the book  this is he a man with just such a face as one often sees among human creatures endowed with an ordinary degree of intellectual powersof the two perhaps leaning to the side of superior intelligenceand with a big powerful figure  a figure deep chested cleanlimbed thinflanked that promised strengtharms long and sinewy with the musclemuch developed in many a boxingmatch or many a cricketfieldrising in knotted cords upon them and a great columnar throat a head rather apt at towering stately over the heads of other men  penthouse brows that had been seen to scowl dwelling under them in their shadow luminous dark eyeseyes that could look very angry or very tender not a good man at all he might hug himself with the satisfactory reflection that during the six lustres of bis existence he had not done one atom of good to any human being but on the contrary had done a good deal of harm  had broken one or two extrabrittle womanhearts  had dangerously cracked several others all without much compunction  women he used to say in his club where he was listened to with the respect due to much experimental knowledge women were fair game  and game very easily winged too he sometimes subjoined and so on this colonel after a few interviews with kate asks her to run away with him she replies she will do anything for him but naturally inquires why not be quietly married at home in the ordinary way whereupon dare mentions as a small objection his being married already his wife being as he confesses very good and loving  but then he is tired of her and loves kate much more it can certainly be said as his only excuse that he was tired of his wife  but kate reluctantly feels she ought not to run away from home with him for that only and tries to make him understand her sentiments on the point then ensues a desperate scene  embraces kisses c and the colonel nearly succeeds in seducing her when she saves herself at the last moment by appealing to him thus    oh do dare my darling do let me go dont try to keep me it is bitter to part i know dont you suppose i feel that  it is a terrible wrench but oh dare dodo it for my sake what can i say to persuade you  she said in her sore trouble  oh my darlingmy own dare let me go let mo go  at this highly pathetic appeal he gives way and she is saved for the time the whole moral of the scene being what a monstrous shame it is that two loving hearts like these cannot be happy merely because of thc paltry prejudice against a man marrying two wives this takes us up to the beginning of the second volume and the remainder is occupied with kates despair and the imbecility of the good people of the novel after eighteen months separation kate still unmarried and only about nineteen years of age meets her beloved dare once more in a quiet nook of the crystal palace scene number two similar to the first only worse more kisses more embraces he  busy gloating miserlike with bold glad eyes over his recovered pearl eyes that she did not blush or wince under as in the old coy girlish days she was a woman now not a girl past blushing or hiding away from those orbs of fire after a lot of disgustingly immodest and unnatural ravings she consents to be his mistress and to meet him the following day and all this though at the time she first met him in the crystal palace he had another lady with him who he frankly confesses is one of his numerous victims a married lady of rank whom he had seduced merely to keep him from thinking of kate but this seems rather to make kate pity him than otherwise and she is certainly not at all shocked at it to conclude this miserable tale as kate is coming the following day to meet her lover she is persuaded not to go after a severe struggle by an attenuated parson dare is pitched out of a dogcart some short time after and dying from the fall has a farewell interview with kate in which he expresses no penitence for his past life but only a half kind of dread for the future after his death she becomes a protestant sister of mercy and is wretched ever after comment on this story is needless we may observe though that the dressing and details of the novel are worthy of the tale to justify us in saying this we could quote hundreds of passages but they are too bad for us so we only give this one as an example it is part of a speech made by kate at a time when she was uncertain as to the colonels love and when she had only seen him two or three times it must be remembered too that kate is supposed to have been educated in a good english family and to know nothing of the world  o why will not god let us have what we like and be happy in this world in our own way she groaned  instead of making us always be lifting up our eyes strainingly to a country we cannot see and which we shall most likely never get to at last  o dare i would do anything wicked anything insane for you would i have that time back again when i bad never seen your dark cruel face no i d rather be as i amutterly wretched than never have heard your voice never seen you smile upon me as you did that day by the shore 0 such a minute as that would overpay centuries in hell if i could make a bargain this minute that i should have dare all to myself for just one month and then to die and live in tortures for all the countless ages of eternitywhy id do it this second that i would without a moments hesitation  o dare dare moaned the soft woman voice again  what grand eyes you have how they seem to scorch and shrivel up my soul looking always always through it and fo on with the sickening blasphemy with which we must no more pollute these pages nothing but a sense of duty compels us to quote even so much as we have done this is the kind of speech the author of this book imagines innocent young ladies make when apostrophizing their loves and gives a fair specimen of thc tone and thought of the work worse than even the immorality of the whole novel are the stupid misplaced attempts at sermonising throughout they might bo very well in another work but being where they are they simply disgust we need say no more,britain
the gipsies of the danes dike a story of hedge side life in england in the year 1855 sy george s phillips low  co three generations of legal gossips have told with glee how lord mansfield in the court of kings bench took vengeance on dr brocklesby when the physician whilst giving evidence from the witnessbox had assumed an unwarrantable tone of personal intimacy with the chief jubtice  gentlemen the judge drily observed in his summingup  the next witness is one rocklesby or brocklesby brocklesby or rocklesby and first he swears that he is a physician even as lord mansfield wished the jury to accept with caution dr brocklesbys account of himself so do we advise the public to receive with suspicion mr george s philhpss personal revelations he swears that he was an itinerant lecturer in the service of a great literary association in yorkshire that he undertook to throw a chain of libraries readingroomb and schools for grownup people in the dales of yorkshire and between york city and the seaboard eastward and that whilst he was in the act of throwing this remarkable chain over the country he formed a close alliance with a large colony of gipsies in whose society he saw most of the scenes set forth in his book kindly furnishing us with minute particulars he says  it was my business to deliver at least one lecture during the winter season to the members of one hundred and thirtysix literary societies and mechanics institutes which constituted the union to speak at their public soiries and annual meetings when required to do so and to consult with them in their council meetings as to the bebt means of increasing the members and promoting the general efficiency of the societies regarded as a statement of fact theforegoing passage encourages us to believe that mr phillips is not indebted to imagination for his experiences amongst the nomad occupants of danes dike for we cannot conceive a lot more likely to inspire a simple man with disgust for the usages of civilised life and urge him to seek the fellowship of vagrant outcasts than a literary clerkship the duties of which require its holder to deliver two lectures per diem on the advantages of popular education we cannot imagine a more exasperating servitude than that which mr phillips assures us he underwent in behalf of the unlettered multitude but though it seems quite in the natural course of things that our author should have fled to the tents of the ishmaeutes or to any spot of earth where tables covered with green baize and tumblers of pure water are unknown we are uncertain how far the narrative of his doings with  swarthy pals  may be regarded as simple truth the book itself is a farrago of fact and fiction in verse and in prose the author gives us his views on politics rehgion social manners love opium and black pipes of beer and tobacco in the company of unwashed thieves he loudly sings the praise but for the frailties of respectable people he is deficient in charity and tenderness towards the established church he ia contemptuous smiling with derision at her  calvanistic creed and armenian clergy the principal actor on the stage of his story is a philosopher named pro fanoake mr profanoake has been prosecuted for blasphemy is editor of the  reasonera journal devoted to secularism and keeps a shop in fleet street mr profanoake figures as the champion of a poor man who is  sentenced by mr justice coleridge to one year and nine months imprisonment for the alleged offence of writing blasphemous words on the rectors gate at flamboro enough has been said to show who is the original of mr profanoake for whom the author professes lively admiration besides talking in a sublime style about the interests of priestridden humanity mr profanoake is made to tell the following briliant story  by the way he observes  talking of good tobacco reminds me of a capital joke which happened the other night in one of our aristocratic saloons lord john russell gave a large soirte to which alfred tennyson was invited and during the evening his lordship sauntering up and down his magnificent halls doing the agreeable to his guests happened to recognise tennyson  haw mr tennyson how d ye do  glad to see you haw youve been travelling in europe lately i hear how did you like venice haw fine things to be seen in venice did you visit the bridge of sighs haw yes my lord and saw all the pictures haw and works of art in that wonderful city did you not haw  i didnt like venice my lord haw  indeed  why not mr tennysonthey had no good cigars there my lord and i left the place in disgust indeed haw good evening mr tennyson haw all this is a fact i assure you other facts of similar complexion are put before readers by the gentleman who is a lecturer on the human intellect they are startling facts but we cannot afford space for more than another brief extract from the authors volume   shepherd smith as he is called in england observes mr phillips confidentially or to give him his proper style and name the rev w e smith so long the editor of the family herald whose leading articles in that journal are the choicest specimens of english essay writing and contain some of the finest thinkings and philosophical speculations which have been contributed to modern literature this rare scholar and author takes the same view of swimming that i do here is an accumulation of remarkable facts one short sentence tells the reader shepherd smiths proper style and name mentions the periodical of which shepherd smith was long the editor assigns to shepherd smiths essays their proper place in english literature and certifies that mr shepherd smith and mr phillips have no difference of opinion with regard to swimming,britain
a hamlet in old hampshire by anna lea merritt kegan paul  co certain monotonously insipid experiences of the past few years have rendered the booktaster suspicious of any volume that may come before him with a suggested bearing upon villages or gardens so many hysterical folk have recently bubbled over in print upon the subjects of their suburban garden their village streets the wind across the heath or the snails upon the gravel that this book with its alliteratively rural title and a cover suggestive of something between a noahs ark a dolls house and a sheep farm will be likely to frighten the experienced but outward appearances were ever deceptive and we should be glad to encourage all doubting purchasers and bid them dip further than the cover of a book which is in truth well worth reading from beginning to end and the most pleasing of its kind that has been published for these many days it is not a novel and it is not a volume of short stories it consists of two hundred and odd pages of pleasant cultured talk round and about a cottage in hampshire the village the garden the bees the birds the villagers the children and the lady artist who describes them all and has contributed twentytwo illustrations from her own pencil to illumine the account there is some very pretty wordpainting about gardening and flowers but no sickly raptures and no highfaluting wouldbe poetizing upon the familiar basis of botanical ignorance affront us the author is devout without being sanctimonious a naturelover capable of rhapsody and never maudlin she is herself keenly conscious of the individuality of plants and birds and insectseven of fields and hills and she conveys this personal sense in pleasant simple language  but she is clearly aware that the romantic little robin redbreast is a heartless parricide that the timid little wren battens upon other and more timid forms of life and that the vaunted industrial intellectuality of the bee is incredibly narrowminded and crushingly severe upon the slightest tendency towards individual development but the life described by the author forbids the possibility of pessimism and accordingly we have the following  as englishmen who eat so much mutton are still far from lamblike i think it is clear that the true life or character of the sheep has not remained in the mutton consumed but is seeking a new incarnation and may in time develop more admirable qualities surely the spirit lives and grows through many physical embodiments and to lay down its temporary body for the use of others is only a temporary inconvenience and a worthy selfsacrifice in all this passing and renewal of physical form the continuation and development of the real life reconciles our ideal of the creator and the destroyer the vishnu and shiva of the buddhists united in one godhead and the seeming cruelty of suffering and death disappears it is just as well perhaps that the kindly author does not touch upon the matter of the cats instincts in hunting or even the barbarous cruelty of the domestic hen in its attitude towards weakly or sickly birds of its feather the concluding chapter of the volume in a dramatic and touching story which bears the impress of reality provides a new reading of the old fable concerning digging for hidden treasure  a hamlet in old hampshire by anna ler merritt kegan paul another village and garden chronicle one would think considering how often the amateur author attacks this subject that the general opinion is that it is the easiest kind of book to write perhaps it iswhen done indifferently  but done as it should be nothing is much more difficult mrs merritt with the brush in her hand is a very bold anc1 clever artist but we cannot extend the same praise to her literary efforts she lacks the temperament for this kind of bookfound in perfection in miss mitford and she seems to us to lack sympathy too as a description of the english hampshire for mrs merritts friends in new hampshire in america the book may serve but the english reader will find little to interest him in its pages small beer chronicles must be assisted by more charm than mrs merritt has infused to make them readable,britain

magdalen hepburn  a story of the scottish reformation new novels by the author of  passages iii the life of mrs margaret maitland 3 vols hurst  blackett  magdalen hepburn will sustain the reputation which the author of margaret maitland has acquired it is a sober truthful novel and may find favour with those who do not generally encourage fiction or indulge either themselves or the young people connected with them in the pernicious habit of novel reading to the general class it may perhaps lack excitement  the broad scotch and the deliberate speech in which most of the characters deliver themselves will be tedious to impatient readers the first volume dawdles over the story and delays the action but the interest quickens as the work proceeds it would have been all the better for a few dates the story becomes somewhat confused for the want of them spring and autumn succeed each other with bewildering rapidity and although we read the work with attention we could not make out the length of i time taken up in the narrative it is however a wellprepared and carefullyexecuted picture of the society and state of manners in scotland at the dawn ofthe reformation and the author has made skilful use of authentic materials the chief characters have all the air of stately historical portraits john knox is successfully drawn mrs bowes with her austere gloom sitting in the shadow of a nameless dread is very touching and extremely well done marjorie bowes the reformers wife is a charming creature and magdalen hepburn the heroine was we doubt not a very noble creature in real life but in the book her excellence is monotonous alice her foster sister is very wearisome not to say irritating with her scruples of conscience and it is a great relief when she is married and fairly struck off the list of candidates for becoming saints and martyrs the story turns entirely on the progress of the reformation and the fluctuations of state policy towards those who inclined to it are cleverly managed as affecting the fortunes of those for whom the interest of the reader has been bespoken there are some nicely painted scenes of domestic interiors but the beauty as well as the strength of the work lies in the spirit of quiet heroic selfdevotion to a great object which pervades every character and makes it worthy to be called a  story of the scottish reformation,britain
  state trials political and social edited by h l stephen duckworth  co this edition is admittedly an attempt to introduce the famous state trials of this kingdomthe fate of the traitor the murderer and the witchinto the drawingroom it is true that the editor also aspires to bring the atmosphere of the crown court into the study but it cannot be said that these selections furnish a sufficient text for purposes of reference the text itself is taken bodily from howells and the passages omitted are supplied by editorial connecting links in the interests of the general reader this was certainly the best course to adopt there are thousands who would never make the acquaintance of these trials in the large edition and a readable selection will serve a useful purpose especially since the editor has supplied excellent biographical and historical notes where they are required naturally a good deal depends on the selection of the trials and in this respect also good judgement appoars to have been displayed of the criminal cases that of spencer cowper possesses features which are familiar in detective literature at the same time it is a distinct merit to have introduced the ordinary casual reader to certain phases of the life and manners of an antique world these two dainty volumes are beautifully printed and are furnished with an excellent index,britain
  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust that it has gone far enough to attract readers to a book which i am myself loth to lay down george cotterell,britain
thc daft days by neil munro black wood sc sons we recognise in this story much of the force and grace of the authors earlier writings with a complete variety in the point of view like his previous books it has a highland setting but here the interest is concentrated on a study of child life which is a marvellous piece of sympathetic observation lennox dyce the orphan niece from america is well characterised as artful artless and joyous her  daft days  she comes to the higldand burrowstown at the new year season so distinguished are enlivened by her natural fun and the gifts she inherits from her father a roving actor  and by dint of these and the better endowments of a warm heart and loyalty to friends she wins the affections of all sorts of people in the oldfashioned community quotations which are beyond our compass are needed to do justice to the humour which pervades the book the heroines artistic instincts are in perpetual contrast with the rustic prose of her surroundings as is her precocious vivacity with though sound intelligence and slower humour of her scottish kinsfolk  the daft dans by neil munro blackwood 6s this is the story of a girl of ten who has been brought up in theatrical circles in chicago and is sent over to live with her uncle and aunts in a quiet scottish village modern children have been very frequent in recent fiction but were they all as humorous and original as is miss bud dyce we would regard their coming with pleasure rather than fear if the reader can conceive a judicious blend of pet marjorie and sentimental tommy sandys possessing the charm and humour of the former and the artistic insight of the latter and speaking a most delicious dialect compounded of broad scotch and american slang he will have some idea of the nature of this adorable little lady the other characters in the book suffer rather from their proximity to miss dyce and appear a little thin though the maid kate macneill whose loveaffairs bud makes to prosper is a good specimen of her class we cannot readily forgive mr munro for permitting the child to have the inevitable attack of pneumonia in chapter thirteen and his descriptive style when elated is like that of dickens at his worst but after all bud is the thing and bud il we may use an expression that might have come from her lips is a peach with a stone in it,britain

the wife of sir isaac harman by h g wells macmillan and co 6s this presumably was to have been a suffragette novel something for us all to talk about a quite ferociously vulgar and horrid nouveau rich is the villain a preposterously ornate artificial fellow possessing a wife tall and slender who sees life beautifully who was married to wealth out of the schoolroom who passes her life having babies until she meets the refined and cultured literary man of infinite understanding it is amusing enoughmr wells is always interesting but it is meccano fiction and really rather slovenly especially stylistically oddly enough the only firm character in the book is the vulgarian sir isaac who at any rate is a man though apparently it was mr wells object to show up the other people for the most part curiously like cinema figures flitting inconclusively about the wife does not bite in at all if she is supposed to stand for womans autonomy as against mans possession then the beast is preferable to the beauty but of course this is no new discovery somehow this book strikes a dyspeptic note it is not the wells of tono or the macchiavelli or is it that he is pulling our legs no serious critic can venture to call this more than another novel if he were to be serious about it he might flesh his critical wit both upon its general want of grace and form such phrases as the manifest spending of great lots of money on rather jar the irish never write carelessly like that  fiorton the wife of sir isaac harman by h g wells macmillan  co 6s i at the cost of a certain loss of brilliancy mr wells has gained restraint and we are well content with the exchange believing that he will thereby obtain the attention of a larger public though he may lose the more vociferous plaudits of extremists his tale runs along familiar lines a plutocrat possesses himself of a very young wife her fourth annual child proving anything but a hardy specimen the doctors suggestion of a halt in the interests of the mother is acceded to  but the lady instead of being merely overcome with gratitude for living in an age when so much consideration is accorded to her sex proceeds to speculate on the uses of the freedom she has gained the husband like many other  enlightened employers has not advanced further than recognising that there is something in the idea of providing conditions favourable to obtaining the most efficient service from a dependent consequently when his wife shows a tendency to use her favourable environment to develop an individualitya thing quite outside his requirementshe naturally feels that his generosity is being abused and seeks to imprison the recalcitrant lady she advancing to the position that she has a right to her freedom and to the knowledge that she can obtain the means to gain it by pawning one of her many trinkets seeks shelter with an advocate of womans rights only to find how easily she can outstay her welcome faced suddenly with the fact that causes are not for individuals but individuals for causes she seeks the means for leisure to think things out by the deliberate destruction of a post office window she obtains in addition to her need of the moment the partial subjugation of her husband who promises much in order to avoid a recurrence of such behaviour her lifework is thenceforward centred in preserving hostels founded primarily in the interests of her husbands workgirls from the defects of institutions readers if only slightly familiar with the authors work will gather from our brief sketch the openings that he has made for airing his views on the lives of those who possess more than they need and those who need so much more than they possess in spite of his inadequate command of expressionwe even welcome the little rows of dots which indicate it his thought gains in many passages by tine illuminating way in which it is conveyed of his characters the most important thing is that they serve the main purpose of the book which is to give us the psychological progress of the lady of the title her lover is a very nebulous person to us but the husband would suffice for any novel written only with the object of entertainment it is a difficult matter to confine ourselves to a single quotation we choose the following because it reveals the heros personality the heroines attainment in mental development and the extent of the authors grasp of what is grand and despicable in contemporary humanity 44 she began to realise something sorrowful and pitiful in his quality in his hardness his narrowness his bickering suspicions his malignant refusals of all things generous and beautiful he made her feel as sometimes the children made her feel the infinite eity of perversity and resistance to the ounties and kindliness of life  the wife of sir isaac harman fiction by h g wells macmillan and co 6s if we had once a sincere belief that mr wells was going to take a very high place among the novelists a place in its way as secure and as fine as that held by the great victoriansit was because his best work began to show a quality of human comprehension that was significant that belief is now being steadily crushed for the spoiling of mr wells as an artist proceeds apace his repeated endeavours to combine the lecturehall or the class in economics with his story leads continually to disappointment and there is a lack pf proportion about this latest book which gives no particular hope that the author will pursue the vanishing spirit of art the story of course is good sir isaac selfmade proprietor of many stores and teashops his wife superior restless concerned for the welfare of the girls be employs mr brumley concerned about the happiness of lady harman offering advice sympathy teas in the countrythese are the principal characters but there is nothing repellent about this quite harmless triangle the chief interest lies in the scheme for the hostels for the teashop girlsplaces which lady harman designed as jolly cosy homes but which her husband with sets of rules and fines a system and a matron turned into comfortless institutions the progress of this scheme its difficulties the girls themselves mrs pembrose the grim methodical matron these things make rich comedy nor must we omit lady harmans spasmodic interlude of windowsmashing in an hour of rebellion and the delightful pictures of her friends lady beachmandarin agatha alimony and susan mr brumley ever hovering is a poor figure and quite unconvincing at the last he completely alienates our sympathies by crying hysterically when lady harmanher husband having conveniently diedrefuses him she by a sudden impulse kisses the pathetic figure and we can only hope that she then leaves him as abruptly as the story leaves us for he was quite unworthy of her shorn of its discussions and digressions this novel would have been simpler and stronger as it is it stays on the level of the interesting fiction of the year  the cost of a promise hodder and staughton 6s is a powerful story which mrs baillie reynolds tells extremely well its weirdness and tragedy its humour and pathos cannot fail to entertain the reader from start to finish the author relates successively the making of the promise its keeping and its cost and the conclusion she deftly reaches is when one comes to consider it the only logical way out of a situation beset with difficulties this is the more to be welcomed as it provides quite naturally a very charming and happy ending the theme runs mainly upon precociousness and heredity especially a supposed homicidal taint as personified in a child of ten the daughter of a french father and an english mother in her presentment of this young girl mrs reynolds has overstepped the bounds of probability making all allowance for her parentage her near male forbears were revolutionariesand her baneful surroundings at that tender age with an irreconcilable socialistic village cobbler as chief instructor it is difficult to imagine that one so young as germaine should speak and act in the way she is made to do in these pages especially when the culminating action is a deliberate attempt at murder in the dead of night without the slightest provocation surely even descent from an aunt of charlotte corday and a mind perverted by illteaching are insufficient to turn a child not yet in her teens into a murderous revolutionary however when dealing with this psychological question the author may have had data for her deduction and hence be justified in creating an  infant phenomenon at the end we are happy to be able to say germaine emerges  in every respect perfectly normal and she marries the man whose heart she had tried to reach with a dagger in another way,britain
